The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. In this outcome measure participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability.
The objective of the study is to find out if the medicine fesoterodine is a useful treatment in children with bladder muscle overactivity caused by a neurological condition. Children will be aged 6 to 17 years old. This is done by finding out how well it works, what the body does to fesoterodine, what side effects are experienced and the safety of fesoterodine. It will be compared with the medicine oxybutynin, which is already available for treating the condition.

It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.
CBCL: It consisted of 120 items on behavior and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0= not true, 1= somewhat/sometimes true, 2= very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior: total score range (TSR)= 0 to 36, anxious/depressed: TSR= 0 to 26, attention problems: TSR= 0 to 20, rule-breaking behavior: TSR= 0 to 34, social problems: TSR= 0 to 22, somatic complaints: TSR= 0 to 22, thought problems: TSR= 0 to 30, withdrawn (TSR)= 0 to 16. Rule-breaking and aggressive behavior summarized to externalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 70. Anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints summarized to internalizing problems with a TSR= 0 to 64. All 103 items of 8 domains and other 17 remaining items were combined to give total problems TSR = 0 to 240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary and total problems= better outcomes.
