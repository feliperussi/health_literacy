Favourable clinical response was defined as a CR of improvement and cure. Cure was defined as resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. Clinical Improvement included all the participants who had switched to oral therapy and had meet the following criterion: afebrile (temperature <=38.0°C) for at least 24 hours, absence of new and improvement in at least 1 symptom or sign (fever, pain, tenderness, elevated WBCs, elevated c-reactive-protein) from baseline and worsening of none. EOIV visit occurred within 24 hours after completion of last infusion of the study drug.
Favourable clinical response was defined as a CR of improvement and cure. Cure was defined as resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. Clinical Improvement included all the participants who had improvement but not enough to switch to oral therapy and were still on IV study drug at End of 72 hours and had meet the following criterion: absence of new signs and symptoms, and improvement in at least 1 symptom or sign (fever, pain, tenderness, elevated WBCs, elevated CRP) from baseline, and with no worsening of any symptom or sign.
This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftazidime and avibactam (CAZ-AVI )versus cefepime in children from 3 months to less than 18 years old with complicated urinary tract infections.
Combined response was the combined assessment of clinical response and microbiological response. Favorable clinical response was defined as a clinical response of improvement and cure (at EOIV) and a clinical response of cure (at TOC). Cure defined as: resolution of all acute signs/symptoms of cUTI/improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy required. Improvement defined as: participants who switched to oral therapy and had afebrile (temperature<=38.0°C) for >=24 hr; absence of new and improvement in at least 1 symptom or sign (ie, fever, pain, tenderness, elevated WBCs, elevated CRP) from Baseline and worsening of none. Favourable microbiological response was absence of the original baseline pathogen in source specimen. EOIV visit occurred within 24 hours after completion of last infusion of the study drug. TOC visit occurred within 8 to 15 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral).
