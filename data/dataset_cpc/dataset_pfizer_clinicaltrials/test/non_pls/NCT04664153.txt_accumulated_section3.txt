EASI evaluated severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In this OM, percentages of participants with a PGA score of 0 or 1 are reported.
The investigator or designee assessed tolerability at the site of investigational product application (pre-dose and immediately post-dose). This assessment focused on the treated non-lesional skin using the scale: none = no evidence of local intolerance; mild = minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance; moderate = definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology; severe (to be reported as an AE) = erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules: consider removing topical agent (if still in place); very severe (to be reported as an AE) = strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent (if still in place).
