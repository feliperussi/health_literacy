NIS-LL: a subscale (of 37-item NIS questionnaire) that provided a total neuropathic deficit score for the lower limbs. It assess muscle weakness, reflexes, sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs with a total possible NIS-LL score range of 0 to 88, higher score=greater impairment. Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae); sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0=normal, 1=decreased, or 2=absent. NIS-LL Muscle Weakness score range is 0 to 64, high score=more impairment. NIS-LL Sensation score range is 0 to 16, high score=more impairment. NIS-LL Reflexes score range is 0 to 8, high score=more impairment.
Norfolk QOL-DN: 35-item participant-rated questionnaire to assess impact of DN on QOL; Item 1 to 7: scored as 1=symptom present, 0=symptom absent. Items 8 to 35: scored on 5-point Likert scale: 0=no problem to 4=severe problem (except item 32, where -1="somewhat better", -2=much better, 0=about the same, 1=somewhat worse, 2=much worse). Norfolk QOL-DN summarized in 5 domains (score range): physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy (-2 to 58), activities of daily living (ADLs) (0 to 20), symptoms (0 to 32), small fiber neuropathy (0 to 16), autonomic neuropathy (0 to 12); higher score=greater impairment, for each. Total score= -2 to 138 (higher score=worse QOL).
Karnofsky performance scale was used for rating participant activities of daily living. It rated participant on 11-step scale ranged from 0-100, higher score=participant is better able to carry out daily activities. The lower the score, the worse the survival for most serious illnesses. Score range: 100=normal no complaints; no evidence of disease, 90=able to carry on normal activity; minor signs/symptoms of disease, 80=normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms, 70=cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work, 60=requires occasional assistance, but able to care for most personal needs, 50=requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care, 40=disabled; requires special care and assistance, 30=severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent, 20=very sick; hospital admission necessary, 10=moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly and 0=dead, where lower score=worse survival for most serious illnesses.
Safety And Efficacy Evaluation Of Fx-1006A In Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloidosis
Criteria for clinically significant changes: Supine and standing systolic blood pressure (BP): decrease from baseline of less than or equal to (<=) -20 millimeter of mercury (mmHg), increase from baseline of greater than or equal to (>=) 20 mmHg, systolic BP <90 mmHg or >180 mmHg; Supine and standing diastolic BP: decrease from baseline of <=-15 mmHg, increase from baseline of >= 15 mmHg, diastolic BP <50 mmHg or >105 mmHg; Supine and standing pulse rate: decrease from baseline of <=-15 beats per minute (bpm), increase from baseline of >=15 bpm, pulse rate <50 bpm or >120 bpm; Weight: decrease from baseline of <=-7 percentage (%) or increase from baseline of >=7%.
This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to obtain additional long-term safety and efficacy data for oral tafamidis (20 mg soft gelatin capsule) administered once daily (QD). In addition, this study continued to provide tafamidis to Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx-006 (a 1-year, open-label extension study to Protocol Fx-005 which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tafamidis) or non-Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx1A-201 (a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization, safety, and tolerability of tafamidis) for up to 10 years or until subjects had access to tafamidis for ATTR-PN via prescription. Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of ATTR-PN in their respective country and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may have been withdrawn from the study. Such subjects were considered study completers.
