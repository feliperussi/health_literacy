Time to deterioration was defined as the time from baseline to day to death, first occurrence of progression, or a >=10 point change from baseline in any of the functional status score and global health status/QOL score based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30, whichever occurred first. EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a standardized instrument developed to assess the quality of life of people with cancer. EORTC-QLQ-C30 functional subscale includes 5 items: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. All of the single items of functional status subscale measures and global health status/QOL subscale range from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent a better level of functioning/quality of life.
A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A treatment-related SAE was a treatment-related AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death余 initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization余 life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying)余 persistent or significant disability/incapacity余 congenital anomaly; an important medical event or reaction, including events requiring medical intervention to prevent worsening to any of the previously noted seriousness criteria. Related TEAEs are TEAEs that were judged by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. AEs included both SAES and non SAES.
Cohort 1) Subjects with a documented PR or CR to a prior platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease with disease progression > 8 weeks following the last dose of platinum; or
PFS was defined as the time in months from the first dose of study drug to the first documentation of PD by investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 or death on study due to any cause on or before the data cutoff date, whichever occurred first. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions. Participants with no PFS event at the analysis were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to data cutoff or date of new anticancer treatment initiation, whichever occurred first.
