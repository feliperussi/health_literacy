EASI evaluated severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In this OM, percentages of participants with a PGA score of 0 or 1 are reported.
The investigator or designee assessed tolerability at the site of investigational product application (pre-dose and immediately post-dose). This assessment focused on the treated non-lesional skin using the scale: none = no evidence of local intolerance; mild = minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance; moderate = definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology; severe (to be reported as an AE) = erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules: consider removing topical agent (if still in place); very severe (to be reported as an AE) = strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent (if still in place).

PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In this OM, percentages of participants with a PGA score of 0 or 1 and an improvement of >=2 from Baseline in PGA score are reported.
IGA assessed severity of AD on a 5 point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicate more severity). Scores: 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting; 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. In this OM, percentages of participants with an IGA score of 0 or 1 are reported.
Study To Assess Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability And Pharmacokinetics Of PF-07038124 Ointment In Participants With Atopic Dermatitis Or Plaque Psoriasis
This study is being conducted to provide data on efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of PF-07038124 ointment versus vehicle control in the treatment of mild to moderate AD and mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.
EASI evaluated severity of participants' AD based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD. EASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in EASI relative to Baseline.
