A Study of Avelumab, Binimetinib and Talazoparib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic RAS-mutant Solid Tumors
DR is defined, for patients with OR, as the time from the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause. OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 from the 'start date' until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease and sustained for at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) means event between first dose of study treatment and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of death; inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; disability; congenital anomaly or deemed significant for any other reason. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) may include, but were not limited to, fever, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.
This Phase 1b/2 study will examine the effects of the study drugs, avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib when given in a 2 (doublet) or 3 (triplet) drug combination, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RAS-mutant solid tumors. The Phase 1b part of the study will assess if the different study drugs can be given together safely and which doses to use for further research. Phase 2 will test if the study treatments have an effect on tumor size and growth, and gather more information about potential side effects.
OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 from the 'start date' (date of first study treatment) until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease and sustained for at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Clopper-Pearson method was used.
TTR is defined, for patients with an OR, as the time from the 'start date' (date of first study treatment) to the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) which was subsequently confirmed. OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 from the 'start date' until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with the exception of nodal disease and sustained for at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.
Any adverse events (AEs) occurring in the first cycle of treatment (28 days) which were attributable to study drugs and met DLT criteria. DLT was defined as hematologic: Grade 4 neutropenia lasting>5 days; febrile neutropenia; neutropenic infection; Grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with bleed; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 4 anemia; non-hematologic: Grade ≥3 toxicities (with some exceptions) ; Grade≥3 creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) with creatinine >= 1.5xbaseline; Grade 3 troponin increase with cardiac toxicity; potential Hy's Law cases; eye disorders: retinopathy or retinal detachment Grade≥3; retinal vascular disorder; Grade≥3 uveitis, blurred vision, flashing lights, floaters or others for >21 consecutive days; other Grade 4; cardiac disorders: absolute LVEF decrease >10% and the LVEF was below LLN; other Grade≥3; respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease Grade≥2; bronchospasm Grade 3; skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; non-adherence to treatment schedule; dose reductions.
