This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study with a 4-arm parallel design. Adults 18 through 49 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of: 20vPnC Lot 1; 20vPnC Lot 2; 20vPnC Lot 3; or 13vPnC.
Systemic events fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain were recorded by using an electronic diary. Fever was defined as greater than or equal to (>=) 38.0 degree Celsius (C) and categorized to >=38.0 to 38.4 degree C, >38.4 to 38.9 degree C, >38.9 to 40.0 degree C and >40.0 degree C. Fatigue, headache, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (prevented daily routine activity). Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for the pooled 20vPnC vaccine groups (20vPnC Lots 1, 2 and 3) and 13vPnC group.
Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 3 Lots of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Pneumococcal Vaccine-NaÃ¯ve Adults
Local reactions were recorded using an electronic diary. Local reactions included redness, swelling and pain at the injection site. Redness and swelling were measured and recorded in measuring device units. 1 measuring device unit =0.5 centimeter (cm). Redness and swelling were graded as mild (greater than [>] 2.0 to 5.0 cm), moderate (>5.0 to 10.0 cm) and severe (>10.0 cm). Pain at injection site was graded as mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (interfered with activity), and severe (prevented daily activity). Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for the pooled 20vPnC vaccine groups (20vPnC Lots 1, 2 and 3) and 13vPnC group.
