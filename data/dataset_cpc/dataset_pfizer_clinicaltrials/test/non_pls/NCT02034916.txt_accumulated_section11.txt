Time to deterioration was defined as the time from baseline to day to death, first occurrence of progression, or a >=10 point change from baseline in any of the functional status score and global health status/QOL score based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30, whichever occurred first. EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a standardized instrument developed to assess the quality of life of people with cancer. EORTC-QLQ-C30 functional subscale includes 5 items: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. All of the single items of functional status subscale measures and global health status/QOL subscale range from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent a better level of functioning/quality of life.
A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A treatment-related SAE was a treatment-related AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; an important medical event or reaction, including events requiring medical intervention to prevent worsening to any of the previously noted seriousness criteria. Related TEAEs are TEAEs that were judged by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. AEs included both SAES and non SAES.
Cohort 1) Subjects with a documented PR or CR to a prior platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease with disease progression > 8 weeks following the last dose of platinum; or
PFS was defined as the time in months from the first dose of study drug to the first documentation of PD by investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 or death on study due to any cause on or before the data cutoff date, whichever occurred first. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions. Participants with no PFS event at the analysis were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to data cutoff or date of new anticancer treatment initiation, whichever occurred first.
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; an important medical event or reaction, including events requiring medical intervention to prevent worsening to any of the previously noted seriousness criteria. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs.
A Phase 2, 2-Stage, 2-Cohort Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673), in Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (ABRAZO Study)
CBR24: Percentage of participants with a best response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) sustained for at least 24 weeks, as assessed by IRF using RECIST 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to <10 mm in short axis. PR: >=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. SD: Neither PR nor progression of disease (PD) criteria met. SD follow PR only when sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but previously seen 30% decrease from baseline no longer hold. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions.
The purpose of this 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious germline BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or 2 based on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease:
Cohort 2) Subjects who have received > 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and who have had no prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease
DOR: Time from first documentation of CR or PR, to PD by IRF assessment using RECIST 1.1, or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, with target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to <10 mm in short axis. PR: >=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. PD: >=20% increase (>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions. Participants with no PD or death at the analysis date were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to on or before initiation of a new anticancer therapy or before the data cutoff date.
