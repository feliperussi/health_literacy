The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. In this outcome measure participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability.
The objective of the study is to find out if the medicine fesoterodine is a useful treatment in children with bladder muscle overactivity caused by a neurological condition. Children will be aged 6 to 17 years old. This is done by finding out how well it works, what the body does to fesoterodine, what side effects are experienced and the safety of fesoterodine. It will be compared with the medicine oxybutynin, which is already available for treating the condition.
The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. It consisted of a small board of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). In this outcome measure number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand.
