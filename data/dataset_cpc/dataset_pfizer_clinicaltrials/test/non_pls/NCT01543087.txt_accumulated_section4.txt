For immunogenicity assessment, hSBA was performed with 4 primary MnB test strains. Percentage of participants achieving hSBA titer >= LLOQ were computed along with corresponding 2-sided 95 % CIs. LLOQ was 1:16 for PMB80 (A22) and 1:8 for PMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24) and PMB2707 (B44). Participants of Group 3c (participants from primary study B1971015) were not continued in booster stage. only participants who received bivalent rLP2086 in primary study B1971010 were not analysed for this endpoint. Only participants who received bivalent rLP2086 in primary study B1971012 on a 0-, 2-, and 6-month or a 0- and 6-month vaccination schedule were eligible to be followed for 26 months after booster vaccination
This study is to assess the longevity of immune response in adolescents for approximately 48 months after receipt of a primary series of bivalent rLP2086 vaccination, which is then followed by a booster dose and an assessment of immune response for 12 or 26 months post booster vaccination.
Duration of hSBA Response After a Primary Series of Bivalent rLP2086 Followed by a Booster Dose
Systemic reactions included: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle pain other than muscle pain at the injection site and joint pain, all other systemic reactions were recorded by using an e-diary. Fever was categorized as: 38.0 to 38.4 degree Celsius (C), 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and > 40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as: mild (1 to 2 times in 24 hours [hrs]), moderate (>2 times in 24 hrs) and severe (requires intravenous [IV] hydration); Diarrhea was graded as: mild (2 to 3 loose stools in 24 hrs), moderate (4 to 5 loose stools in 24 hrs) and severe (6 or more loose stools in 24 hrs); Headache, fatigue, chills, muscle pain and joint pain was graded as: mild (does not interfere with daily activities), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (prevents daily routine activity).
