The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Assessments of lesion Severity Score and Area Score are performed separately for each of the four body regions: head (including neck), upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). In each body region, the sum of the lesion Severity Scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the Area Score which represents the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 100 indicates a 100% reduction in PASI scores from baseline.
Treatment-emergent AEs are those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of the study medication. All AEs in the table below were treatment-emergent AEs. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death; is life threatening (immediate risk of death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or that is considered to be an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes. Severe AEs were defined as AEs that interfered significantly with participant's usual function. Both SAEs and severe AEs were according to the investigator's assessment.
The blinded assessor assessed the participant's overall arthritis appears at the time of each visit. This was an evaluation based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator's response was recorded using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (very good) and 100 (very poor). VAS data was rescaled prior to any calculation and analysis. Rescaled VAS score (mm) = (100 mm) × (length at mark in mm/overall length of line in mm). The score range was 0 mm to 100 mm, and a negative change from baseline represents improvement.

PASI 90 indicates a 90% or greater reduction in PASI scores from baseline.
The SF-36 version 2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health concepts or domains: Physical Functioning (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). These 8 domains can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores. The summary component scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), are based on a normalized sum of the 8 scale scores PF, RP, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE, and MH. All domains and summary components are scored such that a higher score indicates a higher functioning or health level. The minimum and maximum scores of the PCS Score are 22 and 59 respectively. The minimum and maximum scores of the MCS Score are 11 and 62 respectively.
This is a 52 week Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the efficacy at 16 weeks and to evaluate the safety and efficacy up to 1 year in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis.
The HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty a participant experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing "no difficulty," 1 as "some difficulty," 2 as "much difficulty," and 3 as "unable to do". Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating more difficulty in performing daily living activities. A negative change from baseline represents improvement.
ACR 20 was calculated as a ≥20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and ≥20% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient pain assessment (a horizontal visual analog scale assessment of the patient's level of pain), patient global assessment (the patient's overall assessment of how the arthritis was doing by a visual analog scale), physician global assessment (a horizontal visual analog scale measure of the physician's assessment of the patient's current disease activity), patient self-assessed disability (a validated and reliable patient self-assessment instrument which measured physical functions in rheumatoid arthritis patients) and an acute-phase reactant (C-reactive protein level). The participants receiving placebo in the initial period (Day 1 - Week 16) were combined into a single placebo group, while those who received PF-06700841 (10 mg QD) in the initial period were combined into a single PF-06700841 10 mg QD group.
