A Study Of PF-06463922 An ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Specific Molecular Alterations
The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either "CNS progression" or "non CNS progression" or "Death") was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.
Participants with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC with or without asymptomatic CNS metastases relapsing after crizotinib therapy and 1 or 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy given before or after crizotinib therapy, or participants with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC with or without asymptomatic CNS metastases relapsing after 1 ALK inhibitor therapy other than crizotinib with or without any number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting were given PF-06463922 100 mg orally once daily (QD) on Day -7 (only for participants scheduled for pharmacokinetic evaluation) and in 21-day cycles from Cycle 1 Day 1 until progression of disease (unless clinical benefit was still achievable), unacceptable toxicity, death or consent withdrawal.
The Identification Test is a measure of visual attention and uses a well validated choice reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this task, the playing cards are all red or black jokers. The on-screen instructions ask: "Is the card red?". A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as it flips over the participant must decide whether the card is red or not. If it is red the participant should press "Yes", and if it is not red the participant should press "No". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
The One Back Test is a measure of working memory and uses a well validated n back paradigm with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: "Is the previous card the same?". A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press "Yes", and if not press "No". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
This test was performed in the same way as the International Shopping List Test, with the exception that, the delayed recall condition required the participant to recall the words from the list 15 30 minutes later without having the list read again. During the recognition condition, the qualified personnel read a shopping list item that may or may not have been on the original list and the participant had to respond either affirmatively (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). Total number of correct responses made in remembering the word list after a delay was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.
