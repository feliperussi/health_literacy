DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) attributable to the combination: (1) hematologic: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days; febrile neutropenia; grade >=3 neutropenia with infection; grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (2) non-hematologic: grade >=2 pneumonitis; grade>=3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that had not been maximally treated; persistent, intolerable toxicities which resulted in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 for Arms A and B or at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib for Arm C during the first cycle; the persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in delay of the start of the second cycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start; in an asymptomatic participant, the grade 3 QTc prolongation persists after correction of any reversible causes.
Percent of participants with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis <10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as >=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD).
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a product or medical device; the event needed not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those occurred for the first time after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment and was not seen prior to the start of treatment, or those were seen prior to the start of study treatment but increased in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the CTCAE version 4.03 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.
Percentage of participants with objective response based on the assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.

Participants with BC refractory to prior herceptin or lapatinib, Her2+ esophago gastric cancer, HNSCC, or NSCLC that were candidates to treatment with a dacomitinib-based combination. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 110 mg once on Day -14 and dacomitinib 30 mg orally once on Day -7. On Cycle 1 Day 1, participants received dacomitinib 30 mg orally once. On Cycle 1 Day 2, participants received treatment with dacomitinib 30 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 110 mg once. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received dacomitinib 30 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 110 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 842 days and the maximum duration of dacomitinib treatment was 841 days.
