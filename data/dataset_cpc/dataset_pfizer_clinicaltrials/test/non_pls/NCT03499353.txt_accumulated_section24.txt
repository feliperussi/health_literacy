For the physical functioning scale, participants self-rated levels of difficulty in doing strenuous activities, taking a walk, how much they needed to stay in bed or a chair, or needed help with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet. Negative change from baseline indicates deterioration in physical functioning and positive change indicates improvement.
Hematology laboratory parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils). Grades of lab results were defined by NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 1(mild)=asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2(moderate)=minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (ADL); Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4=life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5=death related to AE. This outcome measure was based only on laboratory data. As Grade 4 anemia cannot be assessed based only on laboratory data, it was not applicable for analysis in this outcome measure.
For the symptom scale of financial difficulties, participants self-rated how much their physical condition or medical treatment caused financial difficulties. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of financial difficulties and positive change indicates deterioration.
During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.
Chemistry laboratory parameters included albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, non-fasting glucose, bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, and lactate dehydrogenase. Grades of laboratory results were defined by NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 1 (Mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2 (Moderate ) = minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (ADL); Grade 3 = severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization of prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4 = events with life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 = death related to AE.
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all to 4=very much).
For the cognitive functioning scale, participants self-rated the extent of difficulty in concentrating on things or remembering things during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates deterioration in cognitive functioning and positive change indicates improvement.
For the fatigue symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt weak, tired or needed to rest during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of fatigue symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.
For the pain symptoms scale, participants self-rated the extent of pain and how much the pain interfered with daily activities during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of pain symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.
For the GHS/QoL scale, participants rated their overall health and quality of life within the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined as ≥10 point decrease from baseline without any subsequent <10 point decrease.
For the functional scale of sexual enjoyment, participants self-rated to what extent sex was enjoyable for them during the past 4 weeks. Negative change from baseline values indicates worsening of sexual enjoyment and positive change indicates improvement.
For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A linear transformation was applied to raw scores so that transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for this symptom scale. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined as≥10 point increase from baseline without any subsequent <10 point increase. Probability of not achieving definitive deterioration (being event-free) at specified time points (3 and 6 months post-baseline) using Kaplan Meier method were reported.
Probability of not achieving definitive deterioration (being event-free) at specified time points (3 and 6 months post-baseline) using the Kaplan Meier method were reported.
For the GHS/QoL scale, participants rated their overall health and quality of life within the past week. Negative change from baseline indicates deterioration in GHS/QoL and positive change indicates improvement.
For the social functioning scale, participants self-rated how much their physical condition or medical treatment interfered with their family life and social activities during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates deterioration in social functioning and positive change indicates improvement.
For the appetite loss symptoms scale, participants self-rated the extent of lack of appetite during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of appetite loss symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.
For the dyspnoea symptoms scale, participants self-rated the intensity of shortness of breath during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of dyspnoea symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.
For the functional scale of future perspective, participants self-rated how much they were worried about their health in the future. Negative change from baseline values indicates worsening of future perspective and positive change indicates improvement.
For the diarrhea symptoms scale, participants self-rated the intensity of diarrhea during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of diarrhea symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.
EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.

For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Deterioration in nausea and vomiting symptoms was defined as a 10 point or more increase from baseline for that specific time point.

EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes (PROs), consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.
