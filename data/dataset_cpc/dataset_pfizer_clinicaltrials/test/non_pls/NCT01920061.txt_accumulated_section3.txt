DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) attributable to the combination: (1) hematologic: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days; febrile neutropenia; grade >=3 neutropenia with infection; grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (2) non-hematologic: grade >=2 pneumonitis; grade>=3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that had not been maximally treated; persistent, intolerable toxicities which resulted in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 for Arms A and B or at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib for Arm C during the first cycle; the persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in delay of the start of the second cycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start; in an asymptomatic participant, the grade 3 QTc prolongation persists after correction of any reversible causes.
Percent of participants with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis <10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as >=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD).
