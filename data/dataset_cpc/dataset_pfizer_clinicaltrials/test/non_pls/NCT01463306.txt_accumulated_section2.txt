An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to 13 months) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator.
CogState brief battery consisted of 2 tasks-detection and pediatric identification task using a laptop computer with external response buttons. Prior tasks, participants were briefed rules, given an interactive demonstration and a sufficient number of practice trials. For each task, participant responded "yes" using a response button with dominant hand. Participants had to "respond as fast and as accurately as possible." Pediatric identification task: measured choice reaction time to assess visual attention. An event (a card turning face up) occurred in center of computer screen and participant decided if event met a predefined and unchanging criterion (is the color of the card black?); answered "YES" if criterion was met. A participant's RCI was calculated by dividing the change from individual baseline score by ([square root 2] times WSD),WSD=within-subject standard deviation from Cogstate task normative data. Improvement in cognition: RCI <=-1.65, decline in cognition: RCI =>1.65.
