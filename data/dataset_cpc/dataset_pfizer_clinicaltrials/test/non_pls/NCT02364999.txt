This is a multinational, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-Pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC.
A Comparative Study Of PF-06439535 Plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin And Bevacizumab Plus Paclitaxel-Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC
AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
ORR refers to percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 19 of the study in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 which was subsequently confirmed by Week 25. A participant achieved CR if both target and non-target lesions achieved CR, no new lesions; achieved PR if target lesions achieved CR or PR, non-target lesions were assessed as non-CR/non-PD (progressive disease), indeterminate or missing, and no new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions except nodal disease (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be normal in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.
