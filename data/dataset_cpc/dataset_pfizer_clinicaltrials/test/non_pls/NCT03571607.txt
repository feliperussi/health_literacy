A Safety And Immunogenicity Study Of A 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine In Japanese Subjects Aged 6 To 64 Years.
Systemic events included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and were recorded by using an e-diary. Use of antipyretic or pain medication was also collected by using an e-diary. Fever was graded as 37.5 to 38.4 degree C, 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and >40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (>2 times in 24 hours) and severe (required intravenous hydration). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours) and severe (>=6 loose stools in 24 hours). Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (significant, prevented daily activity).
This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Japanese subjects aged 6 to 64 years who are considered to be at increased risk of pneumococcal disease and who are naive to pneumococcal vaccines.
Systemic events included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and were recorded by using an e-diary. Use of antipyretic or pain medication was also collected by using an e-diary. Fever was graded as 37.5 to 38.4 degree Celsius (C), 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and >40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (>2 times in 24 hours) and severe (required intravenous hydration). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours) and severe (greater than or equals to [>=] 6 loose stools in 24 hours). Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (significant, prevented daily activity).
