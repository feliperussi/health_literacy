For the physical functioning scale, participants self-rated levels of difficulty in doing strenuous activities, taking a walk, how much they needed to stay in bed or a chair, or needed help with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet. Negative change from baseline indicates deterioration in physical functioning and positive change indicates improvement.
Hematology laboratory parameters included hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils). Grades of lab results were defined by NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 1(mild)=asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2(moderate)=minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (ADL); Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4=life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5=death related to AE. This outcome measure was based only on laboratory data. As Grade 4 anemia cannot be assessed based only on laboratory data, it was not applicable for analysis in this outcome measure.
For the symptom scale of financial difficulties, participants self-rated how much their physical condition or medical treatment caused financial difficulties. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of financial difficulties and positive change indicates deterioration.
During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.
Chemistry laboratory parameters included albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, non-fasting glucose, bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, and lactate dehydrogenase. Grades of laboratory results were defined by NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Grade 1 (Mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2 (Moderate ) = minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (ADL); Grade 3 = severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization of prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4 = events with life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 = death related to AE.
