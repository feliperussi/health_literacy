The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Assessments of lesion Severity Score and Area Score are performed separately for each of the four body regions: head (including neck), upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). In each body region, the sum of the lesion Severity Scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the Area Score which represents the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 100 indicates a 100% reduction in PASI scores from baseline.
Treatment-emergent AEs are those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of the study medication. All AEs in the table below were treatment-emergent AEs. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death; is life threatening (immediate risk of death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or that is considered to be an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes. Severe AEs were defined as AEs that interfered significantly with participant's usual function. Both SAEs and severe AEs were according to the investigator's assessment.
The blinded assessor assessed the participant's overall arthritis appears at the time of each visit. This was an evaluation based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator's response was recorded using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (very good) and 100 (very poor). VAS data was rescaled prior to any calculation and analysis. Rescaled VAS score (mm) = (100 mm) Ã— (length at mark in mm/overall length of line in mm). The score range was 0 mm to 100 mm, and a negative change from baseline represents improvement.
