Investigator assessed DOR: was defined for participants with OR as time from first documentation of OR to time of first documentation of disease progression/death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR: score of 1(no uptake above background),2(uptake <=mediastinum),or 3(uptake <mediastinum but <=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS,for lymph nodes extralymphatic sites;no new lesions;no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow. PR: >=50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 of largest dominant lymph nodes,no increase in size of other nodes,liver,spleen volume,>=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic splenic nodules,absence of other organ involvement,no new sites of disease. PD: appearance of new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis,at least a 50% increase from nadir in SPD/longest diameter of previous lesion/node. Data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment in participants with no event,started new anti-cancer therapy/had 2 or more missing assessments.
TTR was defined for participants who achieved objective response as time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake <= mediastinum), or 3 (uptake <mediastinum but <=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow. PR was defined as >=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a >=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease.
Investigator assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. PFS data was censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who had no an event (PD or death), for participants who start a new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event or for participants with an event after 2 or more missing or inadequate post-baseline tumor assessment. Participants without an adequate baseline or post-baseline tumor assessment were censored on the date of randomization unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment in which case the death was considered as an event.
