Whole blood specimens were collected at the designated times (Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, 6, and 8, then every 12 weeks until Cycle 50, and Follow-up Day 30) to provide serum for evaluation of avelumab immunogenicity. Human serum ADA specimens were analyzed for the presence or absence of anti-avelumab antibodies with quasi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, following a tiered approach using screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation. ADA serum specimens were screened at tier 1. In the event that there were no positive specimens, no further analyses were to be conducted. If positive specimens were identified, these specimens were further tested with the confirmatory assay to confirm as positive. Number of participants with ADA positive at baseline, ADA never-positive, ADA ever-positive, treatment-boosted ADA, treatment-induced ADA, transient ADA response, or persistent ADA response from baseline up to 2 years. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
A Study Of Avelumab In Combination With Axitinib In Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (JAVELIN Renal 100)
TTR was defined as the time from start date to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). PR was defined as >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must have been assessed. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). PR was defined as >= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must have been assessed. The results reflect data available on cutoff of PCD (03 Apr 2018).
Adverse event (AE)=any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study treatment without regard to causality. TEAE=event between first dose of study treatment and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or worsened relative to pretreatment state. Serious AE (SAE)=AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were graded by worst National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 severity grade. Grade 3 event=unacceptable or intolerable event, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 event caused participant to be in imminent danger of death. Grade 5 event=death related to AE. The results reflect data available on cutoff of LPLV (04 Mar 2021).
