PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip (index joint) affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.
The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant reported treatment impact assessment (to assess participant satisfaction), participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess preference to continue using the investigational product, participants responded using interactive response technology (IRT) on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I definitely prefer the drug that I am receiving now, 2= I have a slight preference for the drug that I am receiving now, 3= I have no preference either way, 4= I have a slight preference for my previous treatment, 5= No, I definitely prefer my previous treatment. Higher scores indicate lesser preference to use the investigational product.
Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 %; >= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; =100 %) in WOMAC physical function subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 24 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant reported treatment impact assessment (to assess participant satisfaction), participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess Patient willingness to use drug again, participants responded using interactive response technology (IRT) on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I would definitely want to use the same drug again, 2= I might want to use the same drug again, 3= I am not sure, 4= I might not want to use the same drug again, 5= no, I definitely would not want to use the same drug again. Higher scores indicate lesser willingness to use the investigational product.
WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0% ; >= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16 and 24 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
Study of the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Tanezumab in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip or Knee.
PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from Baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
Participants were considered as OMERACT-OARSI responders: if the change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was greater than or equal to (>=) 50 percent and >= 2 units in either WOMAC pain subscale or physical function subscale score; if change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was >=20 percent and >=1 unit in at least 2 of the following: 1) WOMAC pain subscale score, 2) WOMAC physical function subscale score, 3) PGA of osteoarthritis. WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and PGA of OA (score: 1 [very good] to 5 [very poor], higher score = worse condition). Missing data was imputed using mixed baseline/last observation carried forward (BOCF/LOCF).
