Hemophilia is a disease that is "inherited", which means it runs in families, and while girls and women can have it too, it mainly affects boys and men. People with hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting. After an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer, but not faster. Sometimes bleeding can happen inside the body and this "internal bleeding" can lead to serious problems.
People with hemophilia have low amounts of one of two proteins called factor VIII and factor IX. When that protein that is essential to clotting is either missing or doesn't work properly, they are diagnosed with hemophilia. People with low factor VIII have hemophilia A, while people with low factor IX have hemophilia B.
Doctors prescribe medicines called "factor replacement therapy" to help the blood clot in people with hemophilia. These treatments work by replacing clotting factors VIII or IX. People with hemophilia A have the option of using Hemlibra, which is treatment for factor VIII replacement. Some people cannot be treated with factor replacement therapy for long amounts of time as the body can develop "inhibitors" that stop the treatment from working. Thus other types of treatments are needed to help people with hemophilia.
Another way hemophilia may be treated is to stop the protein called "tissue factor pathway inhibitor" (TFPI). TFPI acts like a brake and slows the clotting of blood. Marstacimab (PF-06741086) is a new type of treatment known as a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are copies of certain proteins found in the body that can help treat different conditions. Marstacimab works by attaching to TFPI, which removes the brake and lets the blood clot in people with hemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors.
