An intra-abdominal infection, or "IAI", is the name for a type of infection in the abdomen (stomach area). Children with a nIAI may have symptoms such as stomach area pain or fever. Some IAIs are serious, and can require someone to be in the hospital to be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and sometimes surgery. This type of serious IAI is known as a "complicated IAI".
Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is an antibiotic medicine which is used to treat a number of infections caused by certain types of bacteria. CAZ-AVI is currently used to treat serious infections, such as complicated IAI, in adults. This study was designed to learn more about using CAZ-AVI to treat complicated IAI in children, when used together with another antibiotic medicine called metronidazole. CAZ-AVI has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied. The ceftazidime half of CAZ-AVI has previously been approved for use in children.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of CAZ-AVI in children with complicated IAI, when given together with metronidazole, compared to another antibiotic medicine called meropenem. The researchers wanted to answer this main question:
- For children treated with CAZ-AVI, how well was it tolerated, and were there any new medical problems different from those that can happen when using ceftazidime alone?
In addition, the researchers also wanted to see how many children in this study were cured or had an improvement in complicated IAI.
This study compared two groups of children to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of CAZ-AVI when given together with metronidazole, compared to another antibiotic medicine called meropenem. Meropenem is commonly used to treat complicated IAI in children. 
This study was for children who were diagnosed with complicated IAI. The children in this study were at least 3 months old, but younger than 18 years old when they started the study. 
First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This was called “screening”. The children were grouped by age:
- Group 1 (30 children): At least 12 years old, but younger than 18 years old 
- Group 2 (43 children): At least 6 years old, but younger than 12 years old 
- Group 3 (9 children): At least 2 years old, but younger than 6 years old 
- Group 4 (1 child): At least 3 months old, but younger than 2 years old
The children were assigned to join one of two treatment groups. Children in the first treatment group received CAZ-AVI plus another antibiotic called metronidazole. Children in the second treatment group received an antibiotic called meropenem. These medicines were given into a vein with a small tube, and the doses were based on each child’s weight. The children were picked to receive either treatment by chance alone.
