What is advanced non-small cell lung cancer?
Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Some patients have NSCLC that is referred to as "anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive" or "c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)-positive". These patients have changes in their genes that can cause cancer cells to grow. As they grow, the cancer cells can form into a tumor and spread to other parts of the body. When the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is called advanced cancer.
What is crizotinib?
When this study began in 2006, Pfizer was developing the anti-cancer medication Xalkori® or crizotinib. This treatment has been approved in the United States (US), Europe, and in some other countries for the treatment of certain types of NSCLC that have spread to other parts of the body and are caused by a defect in the ALK or ROS1 genes. Crizotinib is known as an ALK-inhibitor and ROS1-inhibitor (and is also a MET/HGFR inhibitor) medication. Potentially, crizotinib may be able to reduce tumor size and stop ALK-positive and ROS1-positive lung cancers from being able to grow and spread.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of crizotinib in participants with advanced cancer, and if appropriate, to identify the dose that could be used in larger studies.
Researchers wanted to know:
How many medical problems, including toxicities, were seen in participants during the first 28 days of treatment with different doses of crizotinib?
How was the study done?  
Researchers tested crizotinib on groups of study participants to find out about medical problems in study participants. Researchers then compared the results between study participants who took crizotinib at different doses. The study participants and researchers knew who took what dose of crizotinib. This is known as an "open-label" study. Participants with a range of cancer types were included in this study so that the researcher could see if the type of cancer made a difference. The dose that the first small group of participants was given was 50 milligrams (mg) of crizotinib once a day for 28 days. The next small group of participants were given a slightly higher dose of crizotinib and the researchers watched for medical problems. This was then repeated for 5 small groups of participants in the low dose group and 5 small groups of participants in the high dose group:
- In the low dose group, the dose of crizotinib was increased from 50 mg once a day to 100 mg once a day to 200 mg once a day and then to 200 mg twice a day to 250 mg twice a day , and finally to 300 mg twice a day.   
- In the high dose group, the dose of crizotinib was increased from 300 mg once a day to 400 mg once a day to 500 mg once a day to 650 mg once a day, and finally to 800 mg once a day. 
For each participant in this part of the study, the 28 days after the first dose were called Cycle 1, and the next 28 days were called Cycle 2, etc. Treatment with crizotinib was to be continued in 28-day cycles for all participants unless the participant developed any severe medical problems. The way that the doses of crizotinib were gradually increased is called “dose escalation”. The researchers did this to find out what was the highest or maximum amount of crizotinib that could be given before the participants had too many medical problems. This dose is known as the “maximum tolerated dose” or MTD.
The researchers used the information they collected on medical problems to work out the MTD for crizotinib. Taking more than one drug at the same time as another, may mean that one or more of these medicines does not work as well as they should or could cause additional medical problems, or there may be no change in the way that the drugs behave in the body. As people with cancer often take many different drugs, the researchers wanted to see if taking crizotinib with other drugs would cause any new medical problems or increase the number of medical problems seen in the study. This type of study is known as a “drug-drug interaction” study. 
To investigate drug-drug interactions, the researchers gave the next small group of new participants a dose of crizotinib that was slightly lower than the MTD, crizotinib at the MTD, or at a dose of crizotinib that was slightly higher than the MTD. These participants were also given midazolam on Day 1 of Cycle 2. Midazolam is a medicine that helps with sleep or anxiety and may be given to people with cancer. It is also a medicine that potentially could interact with crizotinib.
The researchers also wanted to see what would happen when other medicines were given with crizotinib. In a second small group of new participants, the participants were given crizotinib at the MTD as well as rifampin for part of Cycle 1. A third small group of new participants were given crizotinib at the MTD as well as itraconazole for part Cycle 1. Rifampin and itraconazole are medicines used to treat infections and may be given to people with cancer. It is also a medicine that potentially could interact with crizotinib. Treatment with crizotinib was to be continued in 28-day cycles for all participants in the drug-drug interaction groups unless the participant developed any severe medical problems.
The researchers also gave the MTD of crizotinib to participants with different types of cancer. This included participants with ALK-negative NSCLC as well as other types of NSCLC (MET-amplified NSCLC, ROS 1-positive NSCLC, ALK-positive NSCLC, MET Exon-14 positive NSCLC, and other cancers). Participants with ALK-negative NSCLC were given the MTD twice a day in a 21-day cycle instead of the usual 28-day cycle. All other participants in this part of the study were given the MTD twice a day in a 28-day cycle. Treatment with crizotinib was continued in either 21- or 28-day cycles unless the participant developed any severe medical problems. 
Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 16 locations in 4 countries (the US, Japan, South Korea, and Australia). When did this study take place? It began on 19 April 2006 and was ongoing on 30 July 2020.
Who participated in this study? The study included adult participants who had advanced cancer that was not responding to their current treatment. A total of 285 men participated and a total of 281 women participated. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 91 years, and most were white. The majority of participants had either previously smoked or had never smoked and there were very few who were current smokers.
