What is breast cancer?
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In 2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease.
Some people carry changes or "mutations" in their DNA in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes 1 and 2, or "BRCA1" and "BRCA2". BRCA gene mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline). When a person's BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer.
Researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations.
What is talazoparib?
Talazoparib (Talzenna®) is known as a PARP inhibitor. PARP inhibitors are drugs that are believed to inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases", also called "PARPs". PARPs are proteins (made from genes which are part of DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA (like cells with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations) that do not die can become cancer cells.
Clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other PARP inhibitors, may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day.
What was the purpose of this study?
Talazoparib is now approved in the United States, the European Union, and other countries for the treatment of people with a certain type of breast cancer (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative), who have an abnormal inherited BRCA gene, and their cancer has spread beyond the original tumor ("locally advanced") or has spread to other parts of the body ("metastatic"). This study was done to see if talazoparib treatment followed by surgery could result in a "pathologic complete response" (complete disappearance of cancer in the breast or underarm lymph node tissues at surgery) in participants with early breast cancer (original location) who have inherited a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in HER2-negative breast cancer.
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib. They monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study.
How was the study done? Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. Participants received 1 milligram (mg) talazoparib once per day by mouth, for 24 weeks (participants with kidney disease received a lower dose, 0.75 mg talazoparib). Within 6 weeks of finishing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery and study doctors took tissue samples to evaluate and remove breast cancer. This was an “open-label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose they received. Researchers wanted to know: How many participants had a pathologic complete response (complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of treatment with talazoparib followed by surgery?
Participants joined the study and received talazoparib for 24 weeks and were expected to attend a follow-up visit about 4 weeks later. Within 6 weeks of completing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery (if appropriate) followed by another follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Participants were thereafter contacted by phone about every 12 weeks for the remainder of the study.
