What is stasis dermatitis?
Stasis dermatitis is a skin condition that occurs on the lower legs because of slow or 
stopped blood flow. Its symptoms include redness, itch, pain, reduced comfort, 
swelling and not being able to perform daily activities. Stasis dermatitis mostly affects 
older people. Around 15 to 20 million people older than 50 years have stasis 
dermatitis in the United States.
What is crisaborole?
Crisaborole is an oil-based preparation (also referred to as 'ointment') which is applied 
onto the skin. Researchers think that crisaborole may help treat stasis dermatitis by 
decreasing inflammation in the skin. Inflammation is a type of defense mechanism 
the body has, which can lead to symptoms like redness and swelling.
Crisaborole ointment is approved in the US (EUCRISA™) and is available by 
prescription for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic 
eczema which is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry, and cracked). 
However, it is an investigational drug in this study because it is not approved for the 
treatment of stasis dermatitis.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of crisaborole ointment and 
vehicle ointment to treat the symptoms of stasis dermatitis. The vehicle ointment is 
just like the crisaborole ointment, but it does not contain the active ingredient, 
crisaborole. Researchers wanted to know:
Did the symptoms of stasis dermatitis decrease in participants 
treated with crisaborole ointment compared to participants treated 
with vehicle ointment?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested crisaborole on a group of adult participants to find out if participants taking crisaborole ointment (the test medicine) had improved symptoms of stasis dermatitis compared to participants taking the vehicle ointment. Participants took part in this study at home. The study required a total of 3 home visits by home visiting clinicians. First, participants were screened by the clinician to make sure they had stasis dermatitis and did not have any other health problems to be able to join the study. This was known as the “screening period” and lasted up to 4 weeks. Participants who were able to join the study then entered a 6-week long treatment period. During the treatment period, participants were to apply the ointment twice a day to the areas of skin affected by the stasis dermatitis. Participants were asked to provide answers to questionnaires and to take pictures of the lower part of their legs (knees to feet only).
The study participants and researchers did not know who applied the crisaborole ointment and who applied the vehicle ointment. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. Participants were assigned by chance alone (like the flip of a coin), to receive the crisaborole ointment or vehicle ointment. Participants had a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving the crisaborole ointment and a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving the vehicle ointment. The ointments looked alike. No one (including the participants, the doctor, or the study team) was able to choose the group the participant was in. This was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced by anyone in any way.
On Day 1 (the first day of treatment), participants were visited at home by the staff from the study site before they started their treatment. On Days 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during the treatment period, participants received telemedicine check-ups, which were audio and video calls to check for any medical problems. On Day 43 (end of treatment), participants were visited again at home. Participants then received a follow-up telemedicine check-up on Day 71. This was considered the end of the study.
The following figure shows what happened during the study.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 4 sites in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began 26 June 2020 and ended 19 October 2021.
Who participated in this study?
The study included participants older than 45 years who had stasis dermatitis. A total of 66 eligible participants were assigned to receive the study treatment; 32 participants in the vehicle group and 33 participants in the crisaborole group were treated. One (1) participant in the vehicle group was not treated because they decided not to use the study medication.
- A total of 35 men participated
- A total of 30 women participated
- All participants were between the ages of 48 years and 95 years.
Participants were to be treated for 6 weeks. Of the 65 participants who were treated with crisaborole or vehicle ointment, 49 out of the 65 participants finished their treatment. There were 64 out of 65 participants who finished the follow-up part of the study, 1 participant in the vehicle group was lost to follow up after not continuing their treatment.
