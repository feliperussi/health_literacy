What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis, or "RA", is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. RA is an "autoimmune disease", which means that patients with RA have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked.
What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used to treat adults with active, moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medicines known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate ("MTX"). Tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease RA signs and symptoms.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor). TNF inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune system.
Cardiovascular disease is a disease of the heart or blood vessels.

How was the study done?
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. Participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either: tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth, tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information about tofacitinib), or a TNF inhibitor (participants in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by injection under the skin). This was an “open-label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received.
Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at Month 2, Month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end-of-study visit, and an end-of-study visit at least 28 days later. The figure below shows what happened during this study. Researchers wanted to know:
