This study evaluated a group of participants to learn more about the safety of pregabalin. The study included participants between the ages of 1 month and 16 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with partial onset seizures, and participants between the ages of 5 years and 65 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with PGTC seizures. Some of these participants had participated in a previous study with pregabalin, and all participants were already taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs to help prevent seizures) in addition to pregabalin. Participants continued to take their other antiepileptic drugs during the study. 
- This was an “open-label” study, which means that the participants and the researchers knew which treatments and doses they received during the study. Pregabalin was divided into 2 or 3 daily doses and taken by mouth, either as tablets or a liquid, for approximately 1 year. 
- For participants between 1 month and 16 years old, the beginning pregabalin dose was based on weight: 2.5 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, for participants who weigh 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and 3.5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, for participants who weigh less than 30kg (66 pounds). 
- For participants 17 years and older, the beginning pregabalin dose was a total of 150mg per day, divided into 2 daily doses of 75 mg. The study doctor may have adjusted the doses, as needed, but study participants did not receive more than 600 mg of pregabalin per day. 
- Participants were asked to attend 9 visits at the study center, and were contacted by phone at least once per month. Participants (or their parents) were also asked to record any seizures in a diary. 
- The sponsor ran this study at 142 locations in 31 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. It began 21 February 2012 and ended 22 August 2019. A total of 319 (53%) males and 286 (47%) females participated. 491 (81%) participants were 16 years or younger, and 114 (19%) participants were 17 years or older. 
- A total of 76% (462 of 605) of the participants who started the study, finished. A total of 24% (142 of 605) of the participants left before the study was over by their choice, a doctor decided it was best that they stop the study, or they passed away for a reason not caused by taking pregabalin. Additionally, 1 (less than 1%) participant left the study safely, but further information could not be reported due to an issue with the approval required by local healthcare authorities.
