Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. Streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as S. pneumoniae or pneumococcus. Currently, there are 100 known types of S. pneumoniae.
This study is about a vaccine called the "20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", or 20vPnC. A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. 20vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by S. pneumoniae. It is called "20-valent" because 20vPnC prevents 20 of the most common types of S. pneumoniae. 20vPnC is an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use at the time of this study.
After a vaccine is injected into a person's body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. The response to vaccines includes making "antibodies", which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. In the United States, the "13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", or 13vPnC, is currently approved for preventing S. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults. 13vPnC is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of S. pneumoniae. 20vPnC has the same components found in 13vPnC, plus 7 additional components that may widen protection. The Pneumovax 23 vaccine, or PPSV23, is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of S. pneumoniae.
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of 20vPnC in participants aged between 60 and 64 years. The researchers wanted to know if any of the participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site after they were given the vaccine. The researchers also wanted to know about participants who had a fever, felt tired, had headaches, muscle pains, and/or pain in the joints or took medicine for pain or fever after the vaccination.
