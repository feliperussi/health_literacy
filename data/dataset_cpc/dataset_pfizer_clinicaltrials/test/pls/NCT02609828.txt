What are "bone metastasis" and "metastatic bone pain"?
"Bone metastasis" happens when cancer has spread from its original site to a bone. 
Bone metastasis is the most common cause of cancer pain.
"Metastatic bone pain" happens when bone metastasis causes pain. Metastatic bone 
pain is called MBP.
What is tanezumab?
Tanezumab is a study medicine that has not been approved for use in patients. 
Researchers think it could help lessen MBP. Tanezumab was injected under the skin 
using a needle.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to know:
Did tanezumab help participants lessen MBP?
MBP can last for a long time and has a negative impact on well-being. While there are 
treatments for cancer pain, good control of MBP remains a challenge.
Patients who have MBP may need to take "opioids." Opioids are a kind of medicine 
for pain relief. They are given for pain that is rated as medium to worst. But, opioids 
alone may give poor control of MBP.
Researchers wanted to learn if tanezumab could lessen MBP in participants who were 
taking opioids.
How was the study done?
At the start of the study, participants were taking an opioid daily for MBP. When they began a study treatment, they kept on taking opioids at the same time.

What were the study treatments?
-Tanezumab 20 mg
-Tanezumab 10 mg
-“Placebo”
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like tanezumab. The participants and researchers did not know who were given tanezumab and who were given the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Participants were assigned to a group by chance alone.
-Tanezumab 20 mg group: 72 participants were given tanezumab 20 mg.
-Tanezumab 10 mg group: 9 participants were given tanezumab 10 mg.
In the middle of the study, the sponsor removed the tanezumab 10 mg group.
-Tanezumab 10/20 mg group: 1 participant was first given tanezumab 10 mg, but was later switched to tanezumab 20 mg.
-Placebo group: 74 participants were given placebo.
Researchers compared the results of participants taking tanezumab to the results of those taking a placebo. The figure below shows what happened during the study.

Figure 1. What were the 3 parts of the study?
-Screening Period: Lasted up to 37 days
-Treatment Period: Lasted 24 weeks
-Follow -up Period: Lasted 24 weeks

Study doctors and staff:
-Checked the participants’ health and did tests to find out who could join the study.
-Made sure the opioid dose helped to partly lessen MBP of participants.
-Checked if participants could endure the side effects of the opioid dose. Participants were given a study treatment once every 8 weeks for a total of 3 times.

Study treatments:
-Tanezumab 20 mg
-Tanezumab 10 mg
-Placebo
Participants were no longer taking a study treatment. They had check-ups by phone calls and clinic visits. Throughout the study: 

Participants took an opioid daily for MBP. They took opioids by mouth or as a skin patch. They kept a record of their pain scores and medicines taken in a diary. They answered survey questions about their MBP.

Study doctors or staff checked the participants’ health. They asked participants how they were feeling and what medicines they were taking. They took X-rays of the participants’ hips, knees, and shoulders.

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 48 study sites in 15 countries. The countries were in Asia, Europe, South America, and Australia.

When did this study take place?
It began 28 October 2015 and ended 25 June 2021.

Who took part in this study?
The study included adults who were at least 18 years old. They all had cancer with bone metastasis. The participants were taking an opioid every day to treat MBP. But, opioids gave them poor pain relief.
-A total of 86 men and 69 women took part.
-All participants were between 30 and 86 years old.

Out of 156 participants who started the study:
-1 participant left the study before starting any study treatment.
-155 participants were given a study treatment. Out of the 155 participants: 65 participants finished the study. 90 participants did not finish the study. This was because of medical problems, death, or other reasons. Most of the deaths were due to cancer that had gotten worse.

How long did the study last?
Participants were in the study for 48 weeks. The entire study took 5 years and 8 months to complete.

When the study ended in June 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
