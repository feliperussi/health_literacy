Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that causes patches of dry, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in up to 36% of children and up to almost 23% of adults worldwide. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be applied to the skin that can also be used for long periods of time.
Brepocitinib (also called PF-06700841) is an experimental medicine that has not been approved for sale yet. Brepocitinib blocks 2 enzymes (special proteins that cause chemical reactions in the body) called "Tyrosine Kinase 2" (TYK2) and "Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)". TYK2 and JAK1 act like a switch for the cells of the immune system (the body's defense against infection and inflammation). By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer chemical signals believed to cause AD. Brepocitinib was given in the form of a cream that is applied to areas of skin affected by AD.
The main purpose of this study was to explore the effect of multiple doses of brepocitinib on AD. The study also tested whether applying brepocitinib cream once-a-day or twice-a-day had a better effect in treating AD. The researchers asked, "Are patients who are treated with brepocitinib cream more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream?"
In this study, the "vehicle cream" was skin cream that looked just like the skin cream containing the study medicine (brepocitinib), but did not have any medicine in it. To answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The EASI measures how severe a patient's AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the total amount of a patient's skin affected by AD. The researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems they had while in the study.
