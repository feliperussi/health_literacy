Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that causes patches of dry, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in up to 36% of children and up to almost 23% of adults worldwide. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be applied to the skin that can also be used for long periods of time.

Brepocitinib (also called PF-06700841) is an experimental medicine that has not been approved for sale yet. Brepocitinib blocks 2 enzymes (special proteins that cause chemical reactions in the body) called "Tyrosine Kinase 2" (TYK2) and "Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)". TYK2 and JAK1 act like a switch for the cells of the immune system (the body's defense against infection and inflammation). By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer chemical signals believed to cause AD. Brepocitinib was given in the form of a cream that is applied to areas of skin affected by AD.

The main purpose of this study was to explore the effect of multiple doses of brepocitinib on AD. The study also tested whether applying brepocitinib cream once-a-day or twice-a-day had a better effect in treating AD. The researchers asked, "Are patients who are treated with brepocitinib cream more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream?"

In this study, the "vehicle cream" was skin cream that looked just like the skin cream containing the study medicine (brepocitinib), but did not have any medicine in it. To answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The EASI measures how severe a patient's AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the total amount of a patient's skin affected by AD. The researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems they had while in the study.

This study compared patients using different dose strengths and two application schedules to find out if patients who were treated with brepocitinib cream were more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream. The study included adults and children who were diagnosed with mild to moderate AD at least 3 months before enrolling in the study. Study participants must not have taken drugs like brepocitinib (called “TYK2 inhibitors” or “JAK inhibitors”) in the 3 months before they were screened for the study. 

The patients and doctors did not know who used brepocitinib cream and who used the vehicle cream. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. Patients were assigned to one of the 8 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws). This is known as a “randomized and vehicle-controlled” study. 

While patients were only in the study for up to 16 weeks, the entire study took 12 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 70 locations in 10 countries in North America, Australia, Europe, and Japan. It began on 13 May 2019 and ended on 07 May 2020. A total of 136 men/boys and 156 women participated. All patients were between the ages of 13 and 74. 

Patients were to be treated until they completed the study treatment phase, until they chose to stop, or until they had certain medical problems. Of the 292 patients who started the study, 240 finished the treatment phase and 245 finished the follow-up phase of the study. A total of 52 patients did not finish the treatment phase and 47 patients did not finish the follow-up phase of the study. A total of 22 patients stopped treatment before the study was over by their choice, and 2 patients stopped treatment because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. 

The graphic on the next page shows what happened during the study. 

When the study ended in May 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
