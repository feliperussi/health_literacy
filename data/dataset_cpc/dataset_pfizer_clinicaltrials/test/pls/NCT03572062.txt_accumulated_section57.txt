What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms
that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. This
infection can be serious in older adults and in those with underlying medical
conditions. People with serious RSV infection may have trouble breathing and may
need to be hospitalized.
What is the RSV vaccine (RSVpreF)?
This study is about a vaccine called the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, or
“RSVpreF.” A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight
off germs. RSVpreF may be able to help prevent infections caused by RSV.
RSVpreF contains proteins found in the virus that may stimulate the body’s response
to make antibodies (known as the “immune response”), which may protect against
RSV disease. There is no live virus in RSVpreF.
In older adults, immune responses decrease with age, so vaccines may require
additional ingredients (known as “adjuvants”), which may improve the immune
response against infection.
RSVpreF used in this study contains either:
- RSVpreF on its own,
- or RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide,
- or RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide and CpG adjuvant
Vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide have been used safely in vaccines for more
than 70 years. Vaccines containing CpG have been given in research studies of other
vaccines, and CpG is included in a vaccine approved for use in the United States to
protect against hepatitis B (a liver virus infection).

RSVpreF is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by RSV.
This study is the first time that RSVpreF with CpG adjuvant has been tested in
people.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of RSVpreF in healthy
older adults.
Researchers wanted to know:
- How many of the study participants:
o Had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 14 days of their
first RSVpreF vaccination?
o Had nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, diarrhea,
tiredness, or fever within 14 days after their first RSVpreF vaccination?
o Had medical problems within 1 month after their first RSVpreF
vaccination?
o Had serious medical problems or medical problems that required
treatment from a doctor within 1 year after their first RSVpreF
vaccination?
How was the study done?
Researchers studied RSVpreF in healthy older adults to find out if participants had any health problems when given RSVpreF. This study was organized into 2 different cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Cohort is just another word for a group of people in a clinical study.
Participants in Cohort 1 also received a flu vaccine at the same time as RSVpreF. These participants were assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups by chance alone:
- Group 1: Low dose (60 micrograms (μg)) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 2: Low dose (60 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 3: Medium dose (120 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 4: Medium dose (120 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide (31 participants)
- Group 5: High dose (240 μg) RSVpreF with aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 6: High dose (240 μg) RSVpreF with CpG and aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 7: High dose (240 μg) RSVpreF with no aluminum hydroxide or CpG and aluminum hydroxide (32 participants)
- Group 8: Placebo (An injection that does not have any vaccine in it, but it looks just like RSVpreF)(31 participants)
The first 4 participants were watched by study staff for at least 4 hours after their vaccination to monitor for any medical problems, and vaccination for the rest of the participants could begin no sooner than 2 days later. Vaccination was also limited to no more than 6 participants per day for the first week of the study, and participants were followed up for 1 year after their first vaccination. The figures below show what happened during the study.
