Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is a germ or bacteria that can be found in the bowel of some people. This germ is also known as C. difficile or C. diff. Sometimes when people take "antibiotics" to treat an illness, the C. difficile that is in their bowel can multiply. This is because antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria, and killing the good bacteria gives the C. difficile room to spread. C. difficile infections are often seen in people who have a weakened "immune system" because of other illnesses or due to old age. The immune system is what defends the body from germs like C. difficile. When someone has a C. difficile infection, they will usually have diarrhea or loose stools. This is because when C. difficile multiplies in the bowel, it can produce "toxins". A toxin is a substance made by a living cell that is harmful to the body. C. difficile makes 2 different toxins, and these are called A and B. These toxins damage the bowel, and this is what makes people ill. Doctors will prescribe antibiotics to try to get rid of C. difficile. For some people, the antibiotics may not work, and a different antibiotic may need to be given. Sometimes these antibiotics may not work, and the C. difficile cannot be gotten rid of easily, and other treatment options are needed. If the infection cannot be treated, the diarrhea can get worse, and the person could become very ill and may die. Researchers did this study to see if the C. difficile vaccine could help the body's immune system produce "antibodies" against the toxins made by C. difficile. Antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can recognize and help kill germs or toxins. Antibodies can protect people from getting sick if they come into contact with a germ or toxin that the body recognizes. The researchers conducting this study wanted to see if the C. difficile vaccine was safe and if antibodies could be made against the modified C. difficile toxins in the vaccine.
