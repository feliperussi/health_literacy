Heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. One of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high "bad" cholesterol (called LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Having high LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease. Doctors prescribe medicines called 'statins' to patients with high LDL cholesterol to lower the LDL cholesterol in the blood. For some people, statins may not lower LDL cholesterol enough. Researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients who are taking a statin and who still have LDL cholesterol that is higher than what their doctors consider ideal. Bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. It is not a statin. Bococizumab is a medicine that is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) that may help to further lower LDL cholesterol. For this study, researchers wanted to answer the question: Does bococizumab help to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who take statins but are still at high risk for heart problems?
After the primary study had started, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pfizer to do a follow-up study (a substudy). For this substudy, Pfizer followed patients for up to 1 year after the first part of the study ended to monitor for medical problems and to see how long it took for certain antibodies to disappear or lower in amount after patients stopped taking bococizumab. Antibodies are proteins that fight foreign "invaders". In some cases, antibodies can fight against medicines, which make them not work.

Researchers wanted to know if patients taking a statin who took bococizumab had lower LDL cholesterol than patients who took a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested. This study included adult men and women who: 
- Had high cholesterol that required medicine to treat
- Were already taking a statin treatment for at least 6 weeks, and did not plan to change or stop taking their statin
- Had a high or very high risk of heart disease because of other health problems, like smoking, diabetes, or damage to their blood vessels.
Patients were assigned either bococizumab or placebo treatment by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women. Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups more even to compare. 
The patients, study doctors, and Sponsor did not know who took what medicine during the study. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. Researchers use “double-blinded” studies to make sure that the results are not influenced in any way.
Descriptions of Medicines Given in Each Group:
- Group 1: Bococizumab 150 mg. This was used to see if bococizumab lowered LDL cholesterol.
- Group 2: Bococizumab placebo. This was used to compare bococizumab with taking no other medicine besides their statin.
For 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the needs to be in the study. Next, patients were put into 1 of the 2 treatment groups and were treated for 1 year. Twice as many patients were assigned bococizumab as placebo (a 2:1 ratio). At the end of 1 year, patients were followed by researchers for 6 weeks (follow-up phase) to see how they did after taking the study medicines. 
While each patient was only in the study for about 14 months, the whole study took almost 2 years to finish. Of the 746 patients who started the study, 643 finished the whole study. 103 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. 2 patients died in the bococizumab group, and 2 patients died in the placebo group. Study doctors and the sponsor determined that study medicines did not cause their deaths.
