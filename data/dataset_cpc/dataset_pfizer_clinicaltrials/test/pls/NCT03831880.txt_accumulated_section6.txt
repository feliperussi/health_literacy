Growth hormone is a substance that is needed for normal growth. It is made by a small gland in the brain called the "pituitary gland". Some children have a condition called "growth hormone deficiency", which means that their pituitary gland is not making enough growth hormone. Children who are not treated for this condition may not grow and be as tall as other children of the same age.
Doctors may prescribe a medicine called Genotropin® (somatropin) that helps children with growth hormone deficiency to grow. Genotropin is known as a "recombinant human growth hormone", which means that it is identical to the natural human growth hormone, but is made by scientists to be used as a medicine. This treatment involves injections with a small needle under the skin, given each day.
Researchers have developed a recombinant human growth hormone called somatrogon. It is given once per week instead of each day. The purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of somatrogon in children with growth hormone deficiency. Researchers wanted to know:
- How much did a weekly treatment schedule with somatrogon interfere with the patient's life, compared to a daily treatment schedule with Genotropin?
The study also looked at the overall safety of somatrogon in children with growth hormone deficiency.
This study compared the “treatment burden” (interference in child’s life) of a weekly treatment schedule with somatrogon, compared to a daily treatment schedule with Genotropin. The study included children between the ages of 3 and 18 years. All children in the study had been diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, had low levels of growth hormone, and were currently receiving daily treatment with Genotropin for at least 3 months.
