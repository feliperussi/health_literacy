Hemophilia is a disease that is "inherited", which means it runs in families, and while girls and women can have it too, it mainly affects boys and men. People with hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting. After an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer, but not faster. Sometimes bleeding can happen inside the body and this "internal bleeding" can lead to serious problems.
People with hemophilia have low amounts of one of two proteins called factor VIII and factor IX. When that protein that is essential to clotting is either missing or doesn't work properly, they are diagnosed with hemophilia. People with low factor VIII have hemophilia A, while people with low factor IX have hemophilia B.
Doctors prescribe medicines called "factor replacement therapy" to help the blood clot in people with hemophilia. These treatments work by replacing clotting factors VIII or IX. People with hemophilia A have the option of using Hemlibra, which is treatment for factor VIII replacement. Some people cannot be treated with factor replacement therapy for long amounts of time as the body can develop "inhibitors" that stop the treatment from working. Thus other types of treatments are needed to help people with hemophilia.
Another way hemophilia may be treated is to stop the protein called "tissue factor pathway inhibitor" (TFPI). TFPI acts like a brake and slows the clotting of blood. Marstacimab (PF-06741086) is a new type of treatment known as a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are copies of certain proteins found in the body that can help treat different conditions. Marstacimab works by attaching to TFPI, which removes the brake and lets the blood clot in people with hemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors.
Marstacimab is given as a subcutaneous injection with a needle just underneath the skin. The medicine eventually enters the bloodstream and is carried around the body where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes.
The purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of Marstacimab at different doses in participants with severe hemophilia.

This study evaluated two groups of participants given weekly injections of Marstacimab at different doses. This was done to see if participants had any medical problems while taking Marstacimab and to see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. The study was open to male participants, between 18 and 75 years old, with a diagnosis of severe hemophilia type A or B, with or without inhibitors. Twenty (20) participants enrolled in the study: 18 of these participants had participated in a previous Marstacimab study (B7841002) and the other 2 participants, both without inhibitors, were taking Marstacimab for the first time. This was an open-label study, so everyone, including the participants, knew what treatment was given to each group. 
While participants were only in the study for 1 year, the entire study took 26 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 11 locations in 9 countries in Africa, Europe, North America and South America. It began 30 May 2018 and ended 05 August 2020. Twenty (20) men and no women participated. All participants were between the ages of 19 and 57 years old.
