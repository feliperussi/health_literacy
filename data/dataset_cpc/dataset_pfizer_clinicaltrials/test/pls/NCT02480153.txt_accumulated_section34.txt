```Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the 
joints. RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with RA have an 
overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as 
the joints. RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked. 
There are medicines that can be used to treat RA. One medicine that is approved for 
treatment of RA is called HUMIRA® (in this document HUMIRA® is also called 
adalimumab). Adalimumab may help calm the activity of the immune system and 
decrease RA symptoms. 
PF-06410293 is a new medicine being studied for RA. PF-06410293 was made to be 
similar to adalimumab. The reason for making a drug that is similar to adalimumab is 
to help give patients access to another treatment option. 
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about using PF-06410293 to treat 
RA, compared to adalimumab, and to determine if the 2 medicines are similar. The 
researchers wanted to answer this question: 
• How many patients who took PF-06410293 had at least 
20% improvement in RA symptoms at week 12 of the study, compared 
to patients who took adalimumab?```
This study compared two groups of patients to learn more about using PF-06410293 to treat RA, compared to adalimumab. The study included adult patients with moderate to severe RA. All the patients in this study were already taking another medicine for RA called methotrexate (MTX), but still had RA symptoms. 
First, the patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. Next, patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups: 
- 297 patients were assigned to receive PF-06410293 plus MTX 
- 300 patients were assigned to receive adalimumab plus MTX. 
PF-06410293 and adalimumab were given as an injection under the skin. The study doctor or nurse showed the patients how to do the injection, then the patients were to give themselves the injections at home. The dose was 40 milligrams (mg) every other week. In addition, the patients were required to continue taking MTX as prescribed by the doctor.  
The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06410293 and who took adalimumab. This is known as a “blinded” study. Patients were picked for each treatment by chance alone. 
There were four parts to this study: 
- Treatment period 1 started with the first dose of study drug and ended during week 26.  
- Treatment period 2 started during week 26 and ended during week 52. At the beginning of this treatment period, patients from the adalimumab group were randomly assigned to either continue taking adalimumab or switch to PF-06410293.  
- Treatment period 3 started during week 52 and ended during week 78. At the beginning of this treatment period, all the remaining patients in the adalimumab group were switched to PF-06410293.  
- Follow-up period for 16 weeks after the last dose of the study drug.
While patients were only in the study for up to 92 weeks (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 2 ½ years to complete. Patients joined the study at one of 151 locations in 24 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, Europe, North America, and South America. The first patient joined the study on 25 June 2015 and the last patient finished the study on 06 December 2017. A total of 470 women and 127 men joined the study.
