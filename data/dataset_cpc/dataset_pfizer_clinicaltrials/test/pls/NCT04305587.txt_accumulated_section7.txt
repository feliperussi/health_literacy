What is Type 2 diabetes mellitus?
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease which, over time, can cause higher than normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) and this can harm the health of people with T2DM.
Insulin is a hormone that lowers the level of sugar in the blood and glucagon is a substance which helps the body produce more sugar when it is needed. With T2DM, the body does not release enough insulin into the blood and can have too much glucagon in the blood. This can lead to high levels of sugar in the blood. If your blood sugar increases and remains high over a long period of time, this can lead to harmful effects such as heart problems, kidney disease, eye disorders, and poor circulation in your limbs. That is why it is important to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.
What is PF-07081532?
PF-07081532 is an experimental medicine that is taken as a tablet by mouth and is not yet approved for use by health authorities. PF-07081532 is a type of medicine known as a "glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist" and is intended to keep blood sugar at healthy levels. These medicines work by increasing the amount of insulin released and lowering the amount of glucagon released into the blood. They also slow down the digestion of food and increase the feeling of fullness after eating. PF-07081532 may help in lowering blood sugar levels and body weight if taken along with appropriate diet and exercise.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to see if different doses of PF-07081532 were safe when given to people with T2DM and people with obesity without diabetes. This report describes what happened during the study, what the results of the study are, and how participants can learn more about the study. Researchers wanted to know:
