Heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. One of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high "bad" cholesterol (called LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Having high LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease. Doctors prescribe medicines called 'statins' to patients with high LDL cholesterol to lower the LDL cholesterol in the blood. For some people, statins may not lower LDL cholesterol enough. Researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients who are taking a statin and who still have LDL cholesterol that is higher than what their doctors consider ideal. Bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. It is not a statin. Bococizumab is a medicine that is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) that may help to further lower LDL cholesterol. For this study, researchers wanted to answer the question: Does bococizumab help to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who take statins but are still at high risk for heart problems?
After the primary study had started, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pfizer to do a follow-up study (a substudy). For this substudy, Pfizer followed patients for up to 1 year after the first part of the study ended to monitor for medical problems and to see how long it took for certain antibodies to disappear or lower in amount after patients stopped taking bococizumab. Antibodies are proteins that fight foreign "invaders". In some cases, antibodies can fight against medicines, which make them not work.
