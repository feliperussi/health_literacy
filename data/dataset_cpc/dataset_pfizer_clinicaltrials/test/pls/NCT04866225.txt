What is Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis with Liver Fibrosis?
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis is a medical condition where there is a high amount of fat in the liver along with inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) that causes a stiff liver.
What is ervogastat?
Ervogastat (PF-06865571) is a new investigational drug that is taken by mouth that has not yet been approved for use by health authorities. Ervogastat blocks a specific enzyme (protein) called "DGAT2" and prevents the body from making certain types of fats. Too much fat in the liver is the first step toward development of NASH and liver scarring. Ervogastat decreases the storage of fat in the liver, which may help treat NASH with liver scarring.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to find out how much ervogastat was in the participants' blood, urine, and feces after they took a "radio-labeled" form of ervogastat. A radiolabel is a radioactive particle attached to a drug that lets scientists measure the amount of study drug in the body. Researchers also wanted to see how ervogastat is broken down or changed by the body. This was done by measuring the amount of drug "metabolites" of ervogastat. Metabolites are the chemicals formed as a drug is broken down by the body.
When ervogastat was injected or swallowed, ervogastat entered the body and moved through the body. Ervogastat entered the blood and organs (for example, stomach, liver, and kidneys) when it moved through the body. Afterwards, ervogastat was removed from the body through urine and feces. Researchers wanted to know:
- How much radiolabeled ervogastat was found in the urine and feces of participants during the study?
- How was ervogastat metabolized (changed or broken down) by the participants' bodies?
How was the study done? Researchers tested 2 different regimens on a group of healthy male participants to learn how ervogastat was handled by the body:
- At the beginning of the first period (Regimen A), participants took one 300 mg dose of radiolabeled ervogastat by mouth.
- At the beginning of the second period (Regimen B), participants first took one 300 mg dose of unlabeled ervogastat by mouth. After 3 hours, the participants then received one 100 microgram (µg) dose of radiolabeled ervogastat by injection into a vein or intravenously (IV).

Researchers took samples of blood, urine, and feces from participants during the study and measured the amount of ervogastat and its metabolites. Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. A diagram of the study design is shown on the next page. This study was an “open-label” study. An open-label study means that the participants and researchers knew what was being given to each participant during the study.

Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 1 site in the United States of America.

When did this study take place? It began on 11 May 2021 and ended on 06 August 2021.

Who participated in this study? The study included healthy male participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for things such as age, body weight, and body mass index (BMI).
- A total of 6 men participated.
- No women participated.
- All participants were between the ages of 25 and 61 years.

Of the 6 participants who started the study, all 6 finished the study. No participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.

How long did the study last? Study participants were in the study for around 8 weeks. The entire study took around 3 months to complete. When the study ended in August 2021, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
