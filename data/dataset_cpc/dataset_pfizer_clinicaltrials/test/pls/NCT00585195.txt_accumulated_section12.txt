What is advanced non-small cell lung cancer?
Lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Some patients have NSCLC that is referred to as "anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive" or "c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)-positive". These patients have changes in their genes that can cause cancer cells to grow. As they grow, the cancer cells can form into a tumor and spread to other parts of the body. When the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is called advanced cancer.
What is crizotinib?
When this study began in 2006, Pfizer was developing the anti-cancer medication XalkoriÂ® or crizotinib. This treatment has been approved in the United States (US), Europe, and in some other countries for the treatment of certain types of NSCLC that have spread to other parts of the body and are caused by a defect in the ALK or ROS1 genes. Crizotinib is known as an ALK-inhibitor and ROS1-inhibitor (and is also a MET/HGFR inhibitor) medication. Potentially, crizotinib may be able to reduce tumor size and stop ALK-positive and ROS1-positive lung cancers from being able to grow and spread.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of crizotinib in participants with advanced cancer, and if appropriate, to identify the dose that could be used in larger studies.
Researchers wanted to know:
How many medical problems, including toxicities, were seen in participants during the first 28 days of treatment with different doses of crizotinib?
How was the study done?  
Researchers tested crizotinib on groups of study participants to find out about medical problems in study participants. Researchers then compared the results between study participants who took crizotinib at different doses. The study participants and researchers knew who took what dose of crizotinib. This is known as an "open-label" study. Participants with a range of cancer types were included in this study so that the researcher could see if the type of cancer made a difference. The dose that the first small group of participants was given was 50 milligrams (mg) of crizotinib once a day for 28 days. The next small group of participants were given a slightly higher dose of crizotinib and the researchers watched for medical problems. This was then repeated for 5 small groups of participants in the low dose group and 5 small groups of participants in the high dose group:
