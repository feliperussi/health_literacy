What is Type 2 diabetes mellitus?
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease where the body does not make insulin or does not respond properly to the insulin in the blood. Over time, T2DM can cause higher than normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) which can harm the health of people with T2DM. People with T2DM are more likely to develop problems with their kidneys, heart, eyes, and nerves.
What is Danuglipron?
Danuglipron (dah-noog-lih-pron, PF-06882961) is an experimental medicine that is taken by mouth and is not yet approved for use by health authorities. Danuglipron stimulates the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and may help lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion. It also increases the feeling of fullness and lowers food intake.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers wanted to see if danuglipron helps lower the glycosylated hemoglobin, or "HbA1c", levels of participants with T2DM whose blood glucose is not under control with metformin treatment (a medicine approved to treat T2DM) and/or diet and exercise. HbA1c is a blood test that measures the level of control of a person's blood sugar. This report describes what happened during the study, what the results of the study are, and how participants can learn more about the study.
Researchers wanted to know:
Did taking danuglipron help lower the participants' HbA1c levels when compared to taking a placebo?
How was the study done? Researchers measured the effect of danuglipron by comparing HbA1c levels of participants who took different doses of the study medicine to participants who took a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine being tested. Participants were put into one of six treatment groups by chance alone, like the flip of a coin. This is known as a “randomized” study. Randomization is done to make the groups more similar for characteristics like age and sex. In five groups the participants received danuglipron and in one group participants received a placebo. Participants in the five groups that received danuglipron were given the study medicine at different doses, depending on which group they were put into. 
After the screening period, all participants took placebo for 14 days. Participants then began taking danuglipron or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks based on which treatment group they were randomized into. This part of the study was “double-blinded”. This means the participants and study doctors did not know who was given which treatment during this part of the study. Researchers use “double-blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced in any way. Finally, participants completed a follow-up visit 4 weeks after taking their last dose of danuglipron or placebo. 
The study design is shown in the graphic on the next page. Participants took danuglipron (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg) or placebo twice a day by mouth in the morning and evening with food. For participants who were assigned to take danuglipron at 40 mg twice daily and above, lower doses of danuglipron were started at the beginning of the study and the dose level was slowly increased, or “titrated up” to the dose listed in the study design graphic. They continued taking the study medicine along with the same daily dose of metformin they were on before they entered the study for 16 weeks. 
Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 97 locations in 8 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. When did this study take place? It began 07 July 2020 and ended 07 July 2021. Who participated in this study? The study included adult participants with T2DM who were being treated with metformin and/or diet and exercise who also met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for things such as age, type of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and total body weight. 
- A total of 209 men participated
- A total of 202 women participated
- All participants were between the ages of 28 and 76
Participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or certain conditions other than diabetes (heart or nerve complications) were excluded from the study. The study doctor confirmed if a patient qualified for the study. Participants were to be treated until the end of the 16-week treatment period. Of the 411 participants who were treated in the study, 316 participants (77%) finished the double-blind treatment period, and 359 participants (87%) finished the follow-up period.
