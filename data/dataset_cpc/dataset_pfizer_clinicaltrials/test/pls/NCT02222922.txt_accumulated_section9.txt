Chemotherapy is often used to treat cancer, but not all patients' cancer gets better with treatment. The drugs used for chemotherapy can kill healthy cells in a patient's body along with the cancer cells, which can cause serious medical problems. Researchers are looking for new ways to treat cancer by directing chemotherapy drugs to cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone.
PF-06647020 is a new investigational drug being studied to treat patients with cancer. An investigational drug is one that is currently not approved for sale in this country. PF-06647020 is a type of medicine called an "antibody-drug conjugate". An antibody-drug conjugate is made up of an antibody with a toxic agent chemically attached to it. Antibodies are special proteins made by the immune system that recognize and stick to specific proteins on the surface of germs or cells. The antibody part of PF-06647020 recognizes a protein called PTK7, which is found in larger amounts on certain cancer cells when compared to healthy tissue. Researchers think that PF-06647020 will deliver the toxic agent directly to cancer cells, slowing their growth and causing the cells to die.
The main purpose of this Phase 1 study was to learn more about the safety of PF06647020, and to find the best dose of PF-06647020 to use to treat cancer in Phase 2 trials. To do this, the researchers asked,
- What medical problems did patients have while taking PF-06647020?
- What dose-limiting toxicities, or "DLTs", did patients have when taking PF-06647020?
DLTs are certain medical problems caused by taking PF-06647020 which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently.
The researchers also wanted to know if any of the patients' cancer got better during the study. To do this, they measured many things, including the "Clinical Response Rate". This was the percentage of patients whose cancer stayed the same or got better during 6 or more cycles of treatment.

In the beginning of the study, patients were treated with PF-06647020 once every 3 weeks (or the “Q3W regimen”). Later on in the study, patients were treated with PF-06647020 once every 2 weeks (or the “Q2W regimen”). This was an “open-label” study, which means that the patients and doctors knew what the patients were being treated with.
