What is rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis, or "RA", is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. RA is an "autoimmune disease", which means that patients with RA have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked.
What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used to treat adults with active, moderate to severe RA that did not respond well to medicines known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate ("MTX"). Tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease RA signs and symptoms.
What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF inhibitor). TNF inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune system.
Cardiovascular disease is a disease of the heart or blood vessels.

How was the study done?
Participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. Participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either: tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth, tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information about tofacitinib), or a TNF inhibitor (participants in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by injection under the skin). This was an “open-label” study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received.

Participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at Month 2, Month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end-of-study visit, and an end-of-study visit at least 28 days later. The figure below shows what happened during this study. Researchers wanted to know: 
How many participants developed cancer?
How many participants developed cardiovascular disease?
How many participants had medical problems? 

Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 323 locations in 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

When did this study take place?
It began on 14 March 2014 and ended 22 July 2020.

Who participated in this study?
This study included adult men and women who:
Were 50 years of age or older,
Had moderate to severe RA,
Had an inadequate response to treatment with methotrexate alone,
Had at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
A total of 952 men (22%) participated,
A total of 3,410 women (78%) participated.
All participants were between the ages of 50 and 88.

Participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to benefit from it, or until the study ended. Of the 4,362 participants who started the study and received treatment, 3,111 completed it. A total of 1,615 participants stopped taking study treatment early - by their choice, because they did not see significant improvement in RA symptoms, because they had a medical problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study.

How long did the study last?
The amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. The entire study took more than 6 years to complete. When the study ended in July 2020, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
