The purpose of this research study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of 
PF-05280586 to currently approved and marketed rituximab for treatment of low 
tumor burden follicular lymphoma (also called LTB-FL). LTB-FL is a type of non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL is a type of cancer which starts in your lymphatic 
system (the disease fighting system). LTB-FL is not as aggressive and has a better 
prognosis (the likely outcome) than other types of NHL.
One of the most common treatments for LTB-FL is with a medication called 
rituximab (also called Rituxan® or MabThera®). Rituximab is given as a monotherapy 
for LTB-FL. Monotherapy means one medicine given without other medicines at the 
same time. Rituximab works by attaching to a protein called CD20. CD20 sits on the 
surface of B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When rituximab binds to the 
CD20 protein it causes the B lymphocytes, including the cancerous ones, to die. 
Rituximab is a biologic medicine. Biologics can be made up of sugars, proteins, 
genetic material, human or non-human cells, and tissues (or groups of cells). 
Rituximab is a good first-line treatment option for LTB-FL as per treatment 
guidelines like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
PF-05280586 is another biologic medicine. PF-05280586 was made to be like 
Rituxan® or MabThera®. It was designed to have a similar structure and work in the 
same way that Rituxan® or MabThera® do. This type of medicine is known as a 
biosimilar. PF-05280586 was the investigational medicine in this study. An 
investigational medicine is one that is not approved for sale in any country. 
The table on the next page shows the differences between rituximab (the "biologic") 
and PF-05280586, (the medicine tested to see if it was a "biosimilar" to rituximab) in 
this study.

Biologic Reference Product
Rituxan® and MabThera®
biologic reference products in this 
study.
Made up of sugars, proteins, genetic 
material, human or non-human cells, and tissues (or groups of 
cells).
Approved by a country's health 
authority for use.
Information is known about safety 
and effectiveness.
Researchers wanted to compare how safe and effective PF currently approved and marketed rituximab for the treatment of LTB-FL. They wanted to see if PF-05280586 could be another treatment option for patients with LTB-FL.
The main criteria which patients had to have to be a part of this study were:
- Adult men and women who had Grade 1 to 3a (cancer that has not spread to distant parts of the body) CD20-positive LTB-FL;
- Who had not been previously treated with rituximab; and
- Who did not have certain symptoms such as fever higher than 38° C for 3 days in a row, recurring drenching night sweats, or unintentional weight loss (more than 10% of your body weight in 6 months).
Rituxan® and MabThera® were the biologic reference products in this study. PF-05280586 was the investigational medicine tested in this study to see if it was a biosimilar to Rituxan® and MabThera®.
Made up of sugars, proteins, genetic material, human or non-human cells, and tissues (or groups of cells), PF-05280586 was designed to have a similar structure and was tested to see if it works in the same way as the Rituxan® and MabThera®.
Approved by a country’s health authority for use, PF-05280586 is not approved by a country’s health authority for use. It must be similar to Rituxan® and MabThera® in structure, effectiveness, and safety to be approved for use. 
PF-05280586 was tested to see if the safety and effectiveness of this investigational medicine is comparable to Rituxan® and MabThera®.
What happened during the study?
Researchers wanted to compare how safe and effective PF-05280586 was to that of currently approved and marketed rituximab for the treatment of LTB-FL. They hypothesized that PF-05280586 could be another treatment option for patients with LTB-FL.
The main criteria which patients had to have to be a part of this study were: 
- Adult men and women who had Grade 1 to 3a (cancer that has not spread to distant parts of the body) CD20-positive LTB-FL; 
- Who had not been previously treated with rituximab; and 
- Who did not have certain symptoms such as fever higher than 38° C for 3 days in a row, recurring drenching night sweats, or unintentional weight loss (more than 10% of your body weight in 6 months).
This study compared 2 groups of patients. One group was treated with PF-05280586. The other group was treated with rituximab. The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-05280586 and who took rituximab. This is known as a “blinded” study. This was done to make sure the trial results were not influenced in any way.
Patients were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair.
While patients were in the study for a year, the entire study took about 3 ½ years to complete. Patients joined the study at 1 of 160 locations in 29 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America. It began 30 September 2014 and ended 19 April 2018. 178 men and 216 women participated. All patients were between the ages of 21 and 93 years old.
Patients were supposed to be treated until they got 4 weekly treatments with either PF-05280586 or rituximab. Of the 394 patients who started the study, 393 patients got at least 1 dose of either study medicine. 1 patient left the study before getting any study medicine. 390 patients finished the 4 weekly cycles of study medicine. 340 patients completed the entire study. This means that they completed all of the visits in the study including the Week 52 visit. 54 patients did not finish the Week 52 visit. They left before the study was over by their choice, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.
