What is meningococcal disease?
Invasive meningococcal disease is an illness which may cause a serious infection in the
blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease is
more common in young children than adults. Children who get this illness are at risk 
for hearing loss and other disabilities. However, invasive meningococcal disease may 
be prevented with a vaccine. A vaccine is a type of medicine that helps people fight 
off germs.
Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. There are different
types of this germ. For example, meningococcal type A disease is caused by the
meningococcus A germ. 
What are MenACWY-TT and 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate 
Vaccine?
MenACWY-TT (Nimenrix®) is a vaccine approved for the prevention of 
meningococcal disease. This vaccine targets 4 common types of meningococcus germ: 
A, C, Y, and W. It is given by injection into the muscle.
Some children in this study also received another vaccine, called 13-Valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (Prevenar13®). Prevenar13 is often given at the 
same time as MenACWY-TT. Prevenar13 targets 13 common types of the 
pneumococcus germ, which can cause ear infections or other serious infections. It is 
given by injection into the muscle. 
For this study, MenACWY-TT was considered an investigational vaccine, which 
means that it's still being studied.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of 
MenACWY-TT in toddler-aged children, when given alone or together with 13-Valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. 
Researchers wanted to know:
Would children have an immune response against meningococcus 
germs 1 month after receiving their last dose of MenACWY-TT?
Would children still have an immune response against 
meningococcus germs 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after receiving 
their last dose of MenACWY-TT?
To answer these questions, researchers collected blood samples from the children. 
The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of
meningococcus germ. Antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can 
recognize and help kill germs. This is known as an "immune response". Antibodies 
may protect children from getting sick when they come into contact with 
meningococcus germs.
How was the study done?
This study compared 4 groups of children to learn more about the effects of MenACWY-TT when given alone or together with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. Children were assigned to 1 of 4 groups by chance alone.
- Group 1: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT (203 participants).
- Group 2: Children received 2 doses of MenACWY-TT, given 2 months apart (197 participants).
- Group 3: Children received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT together with 1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (201 participants).
- Group 4: Children received 1 dose of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, followed by 1 dose of MenACWY-TT given 2 months later (201 participants).

All children were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first dose of study vaccine. Children and their parents/guardians were expected to attend 7 in-person study visits and 1 phone visit. The researchers collected blood samples from the children throughout the study. They looked for antibodies in the blood against the four different types of meningococcus germ.

This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccines the children received. 

Where did this study take place?
The study took place at 54 locations in 6 countries.

When did this study take place?
It began 02 October 2013 and ended 05 December 2019.

Who participated in this study?
Children were checked (screened) by the study doctors to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This study included children who:
- Were between 12 and 14 months of age when they received their first study vaccine.
- Were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors.
- Did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system.
- Had never had meningococcal disease.
- Had been vaccinated with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis containing vaccine (DTP) at least 5 months before joining the study.
- Had not received certain other vaccines.
- Had never had a severe medical problem or allergic reaction to any of the study vaccine ingredients.
- Parents/guardians were informed of the risks and benefits of this study and agreed to participate.

Of the 802 children who completed vaccination, 619 (77%) returned for their 5-year follow-up visit. 184 children (23%) left the study early by their parent/guardian’s choice or because they passed away for a reason that was not related to study vaccination (2 participants).

- A total of 375 girls (47%) were vaccinated.
- A total of 427 boys (53%) were vaccinated.
- All children were between the ages of 12 and 14 months when they received their first study vaccine.

How long did the study last?
Children were in the study for about 62 months. The entire study took more than 6 years to complete. This study was completed as planned. When the study ended in December 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
