What is ulcerative colitis? 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes 
inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC affects the 
mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. People with UC 
experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as active disease or flares. These periods of active disease are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and 
presence of blood in the stools, as well as a sense of urgency. Active disease is often 
followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from 
weeks to years.  
There is no known cure for UC. Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of UC and can even lead to long-term remission. Medication is the most common 
treatment for UC and biologic therapies like infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab 
are often used. A biologic therapy is a treatment that has been developed from a 
natural source, such as a component found in the body, but then updated in the 
laboratory so that it can be used to treat a disease. Biologics are usually produced 
using biotechnology methods. Some people do not respond to these biologics or the 
treatment can stop working after a while. Other medicines that can be used with the 
biologic therapy are needed.  
What is PF-06687234? 
At the time this study started, PF-06687234 was an experimental treatment being 
developed for people with UC that could be used with infliximab. PF-06687234 is 
given by a subcutaneous injection weekly. Subcutaneous means the injection is given under the skin.  
This study was the first time PF-06687234 was used in participants with UC. This 
study was stopped early after the researchers looked at data and saw that 
PF-06687234 was not working as well as they hoped.  
What was the purpose of this study?  
Researchers did this study to learn if PF-06687234 could help participants with UC 
achieve remission as well as if this treatment was safe.  
Researchers wanted to know:  
• Did the participants taking PF-06687234 and infliximab 
achieve remission? 
• Is treatment with PF-06687234 safe and well tolerated?
How was the study done?  
Researchers tested PF-06687234 in a group of study participants to find out if study participants taking this treatment could achieve remission of their UC when also given infliximab. Infliximab is a licensed treatment for UC. Researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study medication to the results of study participants taking placebo and infliximab. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06687234 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. The figure on the next page shows what happened during this study. 
SC = subcutaneous. 
Note: All participants were to remain in the study for 22 weeks even if they stopped the study treatment before they had completed 12 weeks of treatment so that they could be monitored for safety. 
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at 27 locations in 11 countries in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. 
When did this study take place? 
It began 20 December 2017 and ended 07 January 2021. 
Who participated in this study? 
The study included participants who had active UC and who had partially responded to treatment with infliximab, but who had not achieved remission. Participants did not have other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, infectious colitis, or colon cancer. 
- A total of 13 men participated  
- A total of 7 women participated  
- All participants were between the ages of 20 and 73 years. 
Participants were to be treated for 12 weeks with PF-06687234 and infliximab and a further 10 weeks when PF-06687234 was to be stopped but infliximab was continued. 
Of the 20 participants who started the study, 19 participants finished the study and completed the safety follow-up. There were 15 participants who finished the 12 weeks of treatment (7 in the PF-06687234 group and 8 in the placebo group) and 5 participants did not finish treatment. The participants who did not finish treatment included:
