Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. Streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as S. pneumoniae or pneumococcus. Currently, there are 100 known types of S. pneumoniae.
This study is about a vaccine called the "20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", or 20vPnC. A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. 20vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by S. pneumoniae. It is called "20-valent" because 20vPnC prevents 20 of the most common types of S. pneumoniae. 20vPnC is an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use at the time of this study.
After a vaccine is injected into a person's body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. The response to vaccines includes making "antibodies", which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. In the United States, the "13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", or 13vPnC, is currently approved for preventing S. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults. 13vPnC is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of S. pneumoniae. 20vPnC has the same components found in 13vPnC, plus 7 additional components that may widen protection. The Pneumovax 23 vaccine, or PPSV23, is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of S. pneumoniae.
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of 20vPnC in participants aged between 60 and 64 years. The researchers wanted to know if any of the participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site after they were given the vaccine. The researchers also wanted to know about participants who had a fever, felt tired, had headaches, muscle pains, and/or pain in the joints or took medicine for pain or fever after the vaccination.
This study compared two groups of participants to find out if participants given the 20vPnC vaccine followed by placebo reacted differently compared to participants given the comparator vaccine of 13vPnC followed by PPSV23. A placebo does not have any vaccine in it, but it looks just like the study vaccine. A comparator is usually a licensed drug or vaccine that is similar to the one being tested in the clinical study. The study included adult participants, aged between 60 and 64 years, who had not previously been vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC or PPSV23). This trial was “double-blinded”. This means that participants and doctors did not know which participant received 20vPnC and placebo vaccines or the comparator vaccine 13vPnC and PPSV23. This was done to make sure that the clinical study results were not influenced in any way. Participants were put into one of the two vaccine groups by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.
While participants were only in the study for 12 months, the entire study took around 14 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in the United States. It began on 10 October 2017 and ended on 10 December 2018. There were 195 men and 248 women who participated. All participants were between the ages of 60 and 64 years. Participants were given one injection of vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC) at the start of the study (Vaccination 1) and a second injection of vaccine (placebo or PPSV23) approximately one month later (Vaccination 2). The participants had their health checked and blood samples were collected before Vaccination 1 and before Vaccination 2. The participants then returned to the study center for further assessments and for blood samples to be collected one month after Vaccination 2. Participants then had their health checked by telephone 6 months after Vaccination 1. The participants returned to the study center for the final assessments and for blood samples to be collected 12 months after Vaccination 1. 
When the participants visited the study center for Vaccination 1, they were given an electronic diary (e-diary). They were asked to record information about redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after Vaccination 1 in the e-diary. The participants were also to use the e-diary to record information about fever, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, and/or pain in the joints as well as any medicines taken to treat pain or fever within 7 days after Vaccination 1.
