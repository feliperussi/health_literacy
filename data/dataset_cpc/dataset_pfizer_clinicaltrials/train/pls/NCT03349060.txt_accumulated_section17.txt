Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in 15%-30% of children and 10% of adults in the United States. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD.
The drug tested in this study was PF-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. PF-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. PF-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make AD worse. The researchers wanted to ask,
- Are patients who take PF-04965842 more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo?
To do this, researchers used 2 different tests to measure the severity of each patient's AD at the beginning of the study. The researchers measured the severity of AD during 12 weeks of study treatment. The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient's AD had improved or not.

This study compared three groups of patients to find out if more patients taking PF-04965842 had their AD improve compared to patients taking a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. The study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years and older. Patients included in the study:
-Had chronic (long-term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe AD when they entered the study.
-Also had one of the following :
-Had been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines applied to the skin, and their AD did not get better;
-Were unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical problem ;
-Needed to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).
The patients and doctors did not know who took PF-04965842 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. Patients were assigned to one of three treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either PF-04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, PF-04965842 at a dose of 200 mg or placebo. Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving PF-04965842 and a 20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. This is known as a “randomized” study.
This study used two different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment. The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale and measures the severity of AD on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). The second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on four different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.
