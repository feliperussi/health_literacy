What are atopic dermatitis and psoriasis?
Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are two common diseases that can cause 
symptoms like redness, itching, pain, and dry or scaly patches of the skin. While 
researchers think that many things can cause AD or psoriasis, they are made worse by 
inflammation, which is the body's immune system response. 
What is PF-07038124?
PF-07038124 is an investigational medicine that is being studied to treat AD and 
psoriasis. An investigational medicine is one that has not been approved for use 
outside of research studies like this one. PF-07038124 is applied to the skin as an 
ointment. PF-07038124 may improve symptoms of AD and psoriasis by decreasing 
inflammation in the skin.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety and tolerability of 
PF-07038124 when used in healthy Japanese adults (who did not have AD or 
psoriasis). 
Researchers wanted to know:
