What is cancer?
Cancer is the name for a group of diseases in which abnormal cells divide without 
control. Most types of cancer cause solid tumors to form, which are masses of these 
abnormal cells.
What is talazoparib?
Talazoparib (TalzennaÂ®) is known as a PARP inhibitor. PARP inhibitors are drugs 
that inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called "Poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerases", also called "PARPs". PARPs can be found in all normal and cancer 
cells, and are involved in the repair of DNA. Mistakes in the DNA can happen when 
cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. 
Clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other PARP inhibitors, 
may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of 
cancer. Talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around 
the same time every day.
What was the purpose of this study?
Talazoparib is now approved in the United States, the European Union, and other 
countries for the treatment of people with a type of cancer known as metastatic breast 
cancer with BRCA mutations. This study was done to learn more about the safety of 
talazoparib when used long term.
