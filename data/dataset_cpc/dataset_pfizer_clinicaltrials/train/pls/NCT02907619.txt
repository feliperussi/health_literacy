Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that damages muscles, causing muscle weakness and loss of the ability to walk. DMD is most common in boys. Domagrozumab is an experimental medicine studied for DMD. Domagrozumab has not been approved for use outside of research studies. The main goal of this study was to learn more about the long-term safety of domagrozumab in boys with DMD. Researchers wanted to answer this question: 
- What medical problems did boys have during the study? 
To answer this question, researchers looked at: 
- Medical problems that caused the boy to temporarily stop taking domagrozumab, or that caused the dose of domagrozumab to be lowered 
- How severe medical problems were, whether the medical problems were related to taking domagrozumab, and whether boys needed to leave the study because of the medical problems 
- Lab test findings 
- Findings from physical examination, x-rays, and other tests
