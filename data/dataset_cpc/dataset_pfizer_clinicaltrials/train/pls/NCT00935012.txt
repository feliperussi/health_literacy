Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a type of heart disease that is caused by a certain kind of protein building up in the heart muscle. This protein is called transthyretin, or "TTR". TTR is normally made by your liver and carries things like hormones and Vitamin A throughout your body. In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, TTR breaks apart and clumps together in fibers called "amyloid". These amyloid fibers build up in the heart muscle and cause it to become stiff, eventually resulting in heart failure. Researchers are looking for new treatments that can help patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy live longer. 

Tafamidis meglumine (also known as Vyndaqel® and another form of tafamidis, Vyndamax®) is a drug that is now approved in the United States and other countries to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Tafamidis was still an investigational drug when this study began. Tafamidis works by keeping TTR from breaking apart and forming into amyloid fibers. Researchers think that this slows down the buildup of amyloid fibers in the heart muscle, which helps slow down the rate at which the heart disease gets worse over time.

This study was an extension of the Study Fx1B-201, which treated transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy patients with tafamidis for 12 months. The main purpose of the current study was to measure how safe tafamidis treatment is over a longer period of time. Another purpose of this study was to give patients who took part in Study Fx1B-201 access to tafamidis treatment for up to 10 additional years. To measure the safety of long-term tafamidis treatment, the researchers in this study asked:
• What medical problems and serious medical problems did patients have while taking tafamidis?
• How long did patients live while taking tafamidis?
