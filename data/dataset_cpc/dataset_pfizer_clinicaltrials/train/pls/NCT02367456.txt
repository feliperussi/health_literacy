This study included patients who:
- Were diagnosed with AML, or medium to high risk MDS or CMML, and had not received treatment for their AML, MDS, or CMML before.
- Aged â‰¥18 years.
- Had adequate liver and kidney function.
- Were appropriate for treatment with azacitidine.
- Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% of the day (Phase 1 only).
- Were not healthy enough to be treated with intensive chemotherapy (Phase 2 only).

What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
During Phase 1 of this study, 12 patients received glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The goal of Phase 1 was to learn more about the safety of glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 75 mg per square meter of body surface area, given as injections under the skin. Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 28 days. The patients were monitored for medical problems.

What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
The goal of Phase 2 was to find out how many patients would achieve complete remission. 30 patients with MDS or CMML and 30 patients with AML received glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 75mg per square meter of body surface area, given as injections under the skin or into the vein. Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 28 days. Patients with MDS or CMML were monitored for at least 28 weeks, and patients with AML were monitored for at least 24 weeks.

The figure below shows what happened during the study.

The amount of time that patients were in the study varied depending on their response to study treatment, but the entire study took almost 5 years to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 32 locations in 6 countries in North America and Europe. It began 28 April 2015 and ended 29 January 2020. A total of 5 women (42%) and 7 men (58%) participated in Phase 1, and 18 women (30%) and 42 men (70%) participated in Phase 2. All patients were between the ages of 55 and 89. Patients were to be treated until their AML, MDS, or CMML stopped responding or got worse, until they developed unacceptable medical problems, or until they chose to stop treatment or started a new treatment for AML, MDS, or CMML. Of the 60 patients who started Phase 2 of the study, 21 were still in the study at the time of this report. A total of 39 patients left Phase 2 before the study was over by their choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study, or because the patient died. This included 15 patients (50%) with MDS or CMML and 24 patients (80%) with AML. Patient death was the most common reason that patients left the study early.
When the study ended in January 2020, the Sponsor reviewed the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
