Prostate cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, walnut-sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men, and it is often a slow-growing cancer with few symptoms.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers testosterone. Enzalutamide works by interfering with the connections between androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproduction) and androgen receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens). This may help to slow the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving treatment to block androgens. Researchers wanted to answer these research questions:
• How long did patients survive after receiving enzalutamide, compared to placebo?
• How long did patients survive without cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamide, compared to placebo?
This study compared two groups of patients to find out how long patients taking enzalutamide would survive, and how long they would survive without cancer getting worse, compared to patients taking a placebo. A placebo does not have any active medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included patients who had prostate cancer that was spreading to other parts of the body, despite receiving treatment to block androgens. The patients had either mild symptoms or no symptoms due to prostate cancer when the study began. To be eligible to join the study, patients must have never used a type of medicine called “cytotoxic chemotherapy”, which is used to destroy cancer cells.

Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or placebo. The patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Patients were assigned to each treatment group by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. 

First, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. This was called the screening period. During the treatment period, patients received the following treatments:

- Group 1: 871 patients received enzalutamide at a dose of 160 milligrams, taken by mouth each day
- Group 2: 844 patients received placebo, taken by mouth each day

During the treatment period, patients came to study visits every 4 weeks for the first 49 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. At the study visits, imaging tests were done and patients were checked by study doctors to determine if prostate cancer was getting worse. Patients were also asked about any medical problems they were having.

Patients continued taking enzalutamide or placebo as long as the medicine was tolerated and they continued to receive treatment to block androgens. Patients were to stop taking enzalutamide or placebo if:

- An imaging test showed that prostate cancer was getting worse
- Or they had complications caused by cancer spreading to the bone
- And they began taking either cytotoxic chemotherapy or an experimental drug for prostate cancer

Patients came to a follow-up visit 28 days after their last dose of enzalutamide or placebo. Next, patients had the option to enter the long-term follow-up study. During this time, patients were followed-up every 12 weeks.

In September 2013, the researchers finished gathering the information they needed to answer the research questions, and the main part of the study ended. Patients were then given the option to continue receiving enzalutamide (or switch to enzalutamide if they received placebo during the study).

The figure below shows what happened during this study. The amount of time that patients were in the study varied, but the entire study took more than 8 years to complete, including both the main part of the study and the long-term follow-up part of the study. The sponsor ran this study at 207 locations in 22 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. It began 28 September 2010 and ended 8 February 2019. 1,715 men joined study and received study treatment. All patients were between the ages of 42 and 93.

Patients were to enter the long-term follow-up part of the study after they stopped taking study treatment. Of the 1,715 patients who started the study and received study treatment, 428 patients (25%) were still receiving study treatment when the main part of the study ended in September 2013. 1,287 patients (75%) stopped taking study treatment by their choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, because they had a medical problem, because prostate cancer got worse, or because they passed away.

When the study ended in February 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
