C difficile is a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections. It often shows up as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most commonly recognized cause of infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings. The number of C difficile cases has increased recently, including in hospitals and nursing homes, possibly because of stronger strains of C difficile bacteria and increased use of antibiotics. 
There is no approved vaccine to prevent primary C difficile infection. The investigational vaccine used in this study, PF-06425090, is an injection that helps the body produce an immune system response and potentially defend against a C difficile infection. 
The purpose of this trial was to find a safe dose of the PF-06425090 vaccine that caused few or no negative medical problems. This is why 2 different dose amounts were studied. Some volunteers received 3 injections of 100 µg (100 micrograms). Others received 3 injections of 200 µg. A third group received 3 injections of a solution with no active medication in it (placebo). 
The placebo group was used to compare against the effects seen in volunteers who received the 2 different dose amounts of PF-06425090 vaccine (100 µg and 200 µg). 
A previous study has already shown that the PF-06425090 vaccine can produce an immune system response against C difficile in humans. 
This study was divided into 3 stages: 
The first 2 stages tested the 2 dose amounts of PF-06425090 vaccine (100 µg and 200 µg) and placebo in volunteers who were between 50 and 64 years of age (Stage 1) and 65 to 85 years of age (Stage 2). 
Based on the findings in Stage 2, a third stage was planned to compare 3 injections of the most effective (best immune response) and well-tolerated dose of PF-06425090 vaccine (either 100 µg or 200 µg) with placebo in volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age.
This study compared two different doses of PF-06425090 vaccine with placebo in volunteers who were 50 to 64 years of age (Stage 1) and then in volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age (Stage 2).
The study was run at 12 sites across the United States. It began on 28 July 2014 and ended on 28 December 2015. The entire study took 17 months to complete because volunteers began at different times. Stage 1 was completed before Stage 2 started.
Volunteers were put into one of three groups (100 µg or 200 µg of PF-06425090 vaccine, or placebo) by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women. Reducing differences between the groups makes the groups more even to compare.
In this study, the volunteers were “randomized” at a 3:3:1 ratio. This means for every three volunteers who received 100 µg of PF-06425090 vaccine, three different volunteers received the 200 µg dose, and one other volunteer received placebo.
In total, 184 volunteers took part. 42 volunteers started Stage 1, 27 volunteers were men and 15 were women. 142 volunteers started Stage 2, 56 were men and 86 were women. An additional volunteer was randomized to one of the groups, but never received any injections.
The study included: 
- People considered healthy following a medical examination
- People with a long-term condition if it was stable
- Women no longer able to have children (for example, they had been through the menopause or had surgery to remove their reproductive organs).
Over the course of 30 days, volunteers received either three doses of 100 µg vaccine, three doses of 200 µg vaccine or three doses of placebo on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 30. All volunteers were followed for at least 12 months after their last injection.
The volunteers and researchers did not know who was in each group. Only the person who prepared the vaccine for injection knew who received which dose of vaccine or placebo. This is called an “observer-blinded study.”
Stage 3 was planned but did not happen. Vaccinations were stopped in Stage 2 after several volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age had severe redness at the site of their injection.
In Stage 1, involving volunteers who were 50 to 64 years of age:
- 18 volunteers were in the 100 µg vaccine group;
- 18 volunteers were in the 200 µg vaccine group; 
- 6 volunteers were in the placebo group;

In total, 42 volunteers received dose 1, 42 volunteers received dose 2, and 41 volunteers received dose 3.
In Stage 2, involving volunteers who were 65 to 85 years of age:
- 62 volunteers were in the 100 µg vaccine group;
- 60 volunteers were in the 200 µg vaccine group;
- 21 volunteers were in the placebo group;

In total, 142 volunteers received dose 1, 120 volunteers received dose 2, and 28 volunteers received dose 3.
As seven volunteers had severe injection site redness in Stage 2 of the study, vaccinations were stopped. This is why only 28 volunteers received the third dose. Stage 3 of this trial did not happen.
Out of the 184 volunteers in the study, 14 withdrew before it was completed (5 from Stage 1 and 9 from Stage 2). One volunteer in Stage 2, who received 2 doses of 200 µg PF-06425090 vaccine, withdrew after he had a heart attack and later died. The study doctor determined the heart attack was not as a result of the vaccine.
