Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system trigger inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that modify the way these cytokines work could help treat patients with AD.
The drug tested in this study was PF-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. PF-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale. PF-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By blocking Janus kinase 1 activity, the signal to the cells that triggers inflammation is modified.
Patients with AD can have "flare-ups", which are times when AD symptoms are worse. The researchers in this study wanted to learn if patients who saw improvement in AD after beginning PF-04965842 would be able to maintain this improvement and have fewer flare-ups. The researchers asked this question:
- How many patients who took PF-04965842 had a flare-up, compared to patients who took placebo?
This study compared 3 groups of patients who saw improvement in AD after first taking PF-04965842 200 mg for 12 weeks, to find out if patients who then took PF-04965842 for 40 weeks would have fewer flare-ups, compared to patients who then took placebo for 40 weeks. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the medicine being tested. Using a placebo helps researchers learn if the study drug works better than no treatment at all.
