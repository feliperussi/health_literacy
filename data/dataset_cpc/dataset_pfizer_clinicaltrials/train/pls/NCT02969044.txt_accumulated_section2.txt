Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with RA have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. RA can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked, so researchers are looking for new treatment options for RA. PF-06651600 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for RA. Because it is still being tested, PF-06651600 has not been approved for use outside of research studies. The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of PF-06651600 in patients with RA. Researchers wanted to know: - At week 8 of the study, did patients who received PF-06651600 show an improvement in RA, compared to patients who received placebo? A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. To answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI) to assess RA signs and symptoms.
This study compared two groups of patients taking either PF-06651600 or a placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in RA. The study included adult patients with RA who had tried certain other RA medicines, such as methotrexate, but did not get adequate relief. The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06651600 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone.
