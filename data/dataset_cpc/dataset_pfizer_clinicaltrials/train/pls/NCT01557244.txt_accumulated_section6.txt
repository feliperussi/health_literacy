Neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or "NDO", is a bladder condition associated with damage to the nervous system. NDO may be caused by injury or disease to the spinal cord, including certain conditions that are present from birth. People with NDO may not be able to control their bladder and may not be able to hold as much urine in their bladder as other people can, so they may have urine leakage or need to urinate frequently. Additionally, NDO can cause damage to the kidneys and urinary tract if it goes unchecked. 
Current treatment options are limited for children and adolescents with NDO, so researchers are looking for new medicines that may help young people with this condition. Fesoterodine was the investigational medicine tested in this study. Fesoterodine has not been approved for use in children or adolescents, outside of research studies like this one. 
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use and safety of fesoterodine in children and adolescents with NDO. Researchers asked this main question:
- Did bladder capacity increase following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine? 
To answer this question, the researchers measured each patient's bladder capacity (maximum volume of urine that can be held in the bladder before the patient needs to urinate) 2 times: before the patients started study medicine, and again after the patient had taken study medicine for 12 weeks. They compared each patient's first result to their second result.
This study was done to find out if patients would have increased bladder capacity (be able to hold more urine) following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine, compared to before they started taking study medicine. Some of the patients were also compared to patients taking a medicine called oxybutynin XL. Oxybutynin XL was selected to be the comparator medicine because it is widely used to treat NDO in children and adolescents.
