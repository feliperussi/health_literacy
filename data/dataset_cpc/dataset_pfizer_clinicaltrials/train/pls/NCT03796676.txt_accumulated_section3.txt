Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in 15%-30% of children in the United States. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for long periods of time. While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD. The drug tested in this study was abrocitinib, which is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", or "JAK 1", which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, which may help AD improve. The researchers wanted to ask, 
- Are patients who are treated with medicated topical therapy more likely to have their AD improve when also taking abrocitinib compared to patients who are treated with a placebo? 
"Medicated topical therapy" was cream or ointment applied to the skin that contains medicine that is approved to treat AD. To see if the patients' AD got better during the study, the researchers used 2 standard methods to measure the severity of AD at the start of the study and throughout the 12 weeks of study treatment. The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient's AD had improved or not.
