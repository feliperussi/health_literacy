What is type 2 diabetes mellitus?
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common form of diabetes. A person with T2DM either does not make enough insulin or their body cannot use the insulin it makes properly. Insulin is a hormone or chemical messenger that controls the amount of sugar in the blood after eating. Every person needs some sugar in the blood as their body uses this sugar for energy. If a person has T2DM, there is too much sugar in their blood and this can cause lots of different health problems, including stroke, and may even lead to death. Some people with T2DM can control the amount of sugar in their blood with diet but others will need medicine to help them do this. Obesity can increase the risk of developing T2DM.
What is danuglipron?
Danuglipron, also known by the name PF-06882961, is a new type of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is being developed. Some GLP-1 receptor agonists have been licensed for use in people with T2DM, and these are given by injection. Danuglipron is a tablet that is taken twice a day.
GLP-1 is a hormone produced by the body that increases the amount of insulin that is produced after a meal. The word agonist means the medicine needs to bind to something in the body to have an effect, which in this case is to mimic or copy GLP-1. GLP-1 receptor agonists cause the body to release more insulin, which may help control the amount of sugar in the blood in T2DM. GLP-1 receptor agonists also help to increase satiety, which means the person feels fuller after eating and may not eat as much at meals.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare levels of rosuvastatin in the blood when 2 different doses of danuglipron were taken or when danuglipron was not taken with the rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a medicine used to reduce cholesterol in the blood. The researchers also wanted to compare levels of midazolam in the blood when 2 different doses of danuglipron were taken or when danuglipron was not taken with the midazolam. Midazolam is a medicine used to help with anxiety.
The medicines taken in a study are often called study treatment. The participants in this study were healthy adults and took danuglipron, rosuvastatin, and midazolam. This is an early study that will help researchers plan future studies. This study did not test if danuglipron helps to improve control of blood sugar in T2DM.
Researchers wanted to know:
- How did the amount of rosuvastatin and midazolam in the blood change when taken with 2 different doses of danuglipron?
- What medical problems did participants have during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers tested 2 different doses of danuglipron on a group of adult participants with obesity, but who were otherwise healthy, to learn how the amount of rosuvastatin and midazolam in the blood was changed when taken with danuglipron. Participants were to stay at the study center for study periods 1 to 8 and were to take rosuvastatin (one 10 mg dose), midazolam (one 2 mg dose) and danuglipron (at different doses) as follows:
- Period 1 (5 days): one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin only
- Period 2 (2 days): one dose of 2 mg midazolam only on the first day
- Period 3 (28 to 29 days): gradual dosing of danuglipron up to 120 mg twice daily
- Period 4 (4 days): danuglipron 120 mg twice daily and one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin on the first day
- Period 5 (1 day): danuglipron 120 mg twice daily and one dose of 2 mg midazolam
- Period 6 (16 days): gradual dosing of danuglipron up to 200 mg twice daily
- Period 7 (4 days): 200 mg danuglipron twice daily and one dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin on the first day
- Period 8 (2 days): 200 mg danuglipron twice daily and one dose of 2 mg midazolam on the first day
Researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study. Researchers also checked the participants’ health during the study and asked them how they were feeling.
At the end of Period 8, participants had to return to the study center 7 to 10 days after their last dose of study medication for health checks. They then received a telephone call 28 to 35 days after their last dose of study medication to check on their health.
The study design is shown in the following figure.
Researchers compared the levels of rosuvastatin and midazolam in the blood of participants who had taken these medicines along with 2 different doses of danuglipron.
The participants and researchers knew who took each type of medicine. This is known as an “open-label” study.
Where did this study take place? 
The Sponsor ran this study at a single location in the United States.
When did this study take place?
It began 15 December 2020 and ended 13 May 2021.
Who participated in this study? 
This study included adult participants with obesity, but who were otherwise healthy.
- A total of 8 men participated
- A total of 8 women participated
- All participants were between the ages of 30 and 63 years
Of the 16 participants who started the study, 13 participants finished the study. 
Three (3) participants stopped taking the study treatment by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop treatment. Two (2) of these participants stopped treatment, either permanently due to a fall or temporarily because of retching or dry heaving, and 1 participant stopped treatment because of other reasons.
