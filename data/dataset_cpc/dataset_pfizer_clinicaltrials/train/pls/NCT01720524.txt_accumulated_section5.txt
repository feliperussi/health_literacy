"Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn" (PPHN) is a serious condition that can affect the breathing of newborn infants and prevent them from getting enough "oxygen". Oxygen is a gas that is present in the air and all human and animals need this gas to live and grow. The main symptoms of PPHN include fast breathing and increased heart rate as well as a blue tint to the skin, flaring of the nostrils in the nose, and sometimes the baby can make a grunting noise. PPHN is seen in about 2 births in every 1000 births, and around 1 in 10 babies who have breathing problems will have PPHN.
The normal treatment for PPHN is to give babies nitric oxide gas to breathe. This inhaled nitric oxide only helps 2 out of every 3 babies to get enough oxygen. If the inhaled nitric oxide doesn't help the baby, the next step for doctors is to try "extracorporeal membrane oxygenation" or ECMO. ECMO is a way of getting oxygen into the baby's blood with a machine and can help if the lungs and/or heart aren't working properly. The lungs are air sacs that fill with oxygen-containing air, and the lungs are used to get oxygen into the blood.
Sometimes babies with PPHN will pass away even if they receive treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and/or ECMO. Other babies will survive, but they may have developmental problems that make it hard for them to grow, learn things, and hear sounds. New treatment options are needed to help the heart and lungs get enough oxygen into the baby's blood.
