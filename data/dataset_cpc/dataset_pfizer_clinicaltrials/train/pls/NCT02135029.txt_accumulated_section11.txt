```Heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. One of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high "bad" cholesterol (called LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Having high LDL cholesterol can lead to heart problems. 
Doctors prescribe medicines called "statins" to patients with high LDL cholesterol to lower the LDL cholesterol in the blood. Some people have muscle-related medical problems when taking statins. These medical problems include muscle spasms and pain in the muscles (myalgia), which may be severe. This may prevent them from being able to take their prescribed statin medications. 
Researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients with high LDL cholesterol who are unable to take a statin because of muscle-related medical problems. Bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. It is not a statin. Bococizumab is a medicine that was given in this study as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) which may help to lower LDL cholesterol. For this study, researchers wanted to answer the question: Does bococizumab help to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who cannot take statin medications?```
This study compared 3 groups of patients. Researchers wanted to find out if patients taking bococizumab had lower LDL cholesterol than patients who took a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested. One group got a statin medicine (atorvastatin). The statin medicine was used to see if people taking it had the same medical problems as when they had used statins before (re-challenge). 
This study included adult men and women who: 
- Had high cholesterol that requires medicine to treat
- Tried taking at least 2 different statins in the past
- Stopped taking their statins because of muscle problems (like pain, or muscle spasms)
 
Patients were put into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women. Making the groups more similar makes comparing the groups more fair. The patients and researchers did not know who took what medicine during the study. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. Researchers use “double-blinded” studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced in any way.
