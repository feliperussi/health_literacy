Invasive meningococcal disease is an illness which may cause a serious infection in the blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease is more common in children than adults. Children who get this illness are at risk for hearing loss and other disabilities. However, invasive meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine. A vaccine is a type of medicine that helps people fight off germs.
Meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. There are different types of this germ. For example, meningococcal type A disease is caused by the meningococcus A germ. MenACWY-TT (Nimenrix) is a vaccine approved in Europe for the prevention of meningococcal disease. This vaccine targets 4 common types of meningococcus germ: types A, C, Y, and W-135. It is given by injection into the muscle.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the long-term effects of Nimenrix in healthy children, compared to 2 other vaccines against meningococcal disease, called Meningitec® and Mencevax® ACWY. Meningitec is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the meningococcus C germ. Mencevax is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the meningococcus A, C, Y, and W-135 germs. Researchers wanted to know:
- Would children who received Nimenrix still have antibodies against meningococcus germs at 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after vaccination, compared to children who received Meningitec or Mencevax?
To answer this question, researchers collected blood samples from the children. The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. Antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill germs. These antibodies can protect children from getting sick if they ever do come into contact with meningococcus germs.

This study compared 4 groups of children to learn more about the long-term effects of MenACWY-TT. The sponsor asked children who participated in a previous study on Nimenrix to join this study. All the children were healthy and had received vaccination with Nimenrix, Meningitec, or Mencevax during the previous study.
The children were placed in 4 groups (the same groups as the previous study): 
- Group 1: Children who received Nimenrix when they were between 1 and 2 years old (76 children) 
- Group 2: Children who received Meningitec when they were between 1 and 2 years old (23 children) 
- Group 3: Children who received Nimenrix when they were 2 to 10 years old (115 children) 
- Group 4: Children who received Mencevax when they were 2 to 10 years old (29 children) 
The children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study center. This was known as the “persistence phase” of the study. During these visits, the researchers collected blood samples from the children. The researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. 181 children received a booster dose of Nimenrix at study visit 5. This was known as the “booster phase” of the study.
This was an “open label” study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received. The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.
Children were in this study for up to 4 years, but the entire study took almost 5 years to complete. Children joined the study at 1 of 9 locations in Finland. The first child joined the study on 09 October 2013 and the last child finished the study on 11 June 2018. A total of 122 girls and 121 boys joined the study. The children were between 7 and 18 years old when they began the study.
