Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss ranging from 
small patches to a loss of all hair on the head and body. AA occurs when the immune 
system mistakes normal cells in the body as foreign invaders and attacks these cells.  
There is no cure for AA and most countries do not have an approved treatment for 
AA. Treatments that reduce the activity of parts of the immune system are often used 
to treat AA, but some of these treatments can cause other health problems or can 
only be used for short periods of time. Researchers are looking for new treatments 
for AA that can be taken safely for longer periods of time.
Two (2) drugs were tested in this study: PF-06651600 and PF-06700841.  
PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 are both experimental drugs that have not been 
approved for sale yet. PF-06651600 blocks the activity of protein called "Janus 
kinase 3" and the "TEC family kinases". PF-06700841 blocks the activity of 2 other 
enzymes called "Janus kinase 1" and "Tyrosine-protein kinase 2". These enzymes act 
like on/off switches for the cells of the immune system. By turning off these 
switches, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, a 
different type of protein, that are believed to make AA worse.  
The researchers wanted to know,
- Were patients who took PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 more likely to have 
their AA improve compared to patients who were treated with a placebo?
To do this, researchers measured the severity of each patient's AA at the beginning of 
the study. The researchers measured the severity of AA after 24 weeks of treatment.  
The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient's AA had improved or not.
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 had their AA improved compared to patients taking placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included adult men and women who were aged 18 to 75 years. Patients included in the study had moderate to severe AA with: at least 50% hair loss on the scalp and no hair growing back within 6 months. Current episode of hair loss started less than 7 years ago. The patients and researchers did not know who took PF-06651600, who took PF-06700841 and who took the placebo. This was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. This is known as a "double-blinded" study.
Patients were put into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either PF-06651600, PF-06700841, or placebo. Patients had a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving PF-06651600, a 33% (1in 3) chance of receiving PF-06700841, and a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving placebo in the initial 24 weeks of the treatment period. This is known as a "randomized" study. This is done to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.
