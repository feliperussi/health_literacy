Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) is a rare and life-threatening medical condition which worsens over time. There are about 10,000 people in the world known to have ATTR-PN. People with this condition have a particular protein, known as transthyretin amyloid, in their nerves. This can lead to problems with the nervous system, such as weakness, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet (known as "neuropathy") and difficulty walking. ATTR-PN is caused by a genetic mutation (change) in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. The most common genetic mutation that causes ATTR-PN is called "Val30Met".
Tafamidis is a study drug approved in some countries to treat adult patients with ATTR-PN to delay neurological symptoms. The researchers in this study were interested in learning more about the long-term safety and effects of tafamidis.
This study had several purposes:
• To continue to study if tafamidis is safe and the potential effects of tafamidis in patients with ATTR-PN over the long-term.
• To continue to provide tafamidis to patients with ATTR-PN who had participated in previous clinical trials for tafamidis and were benefiting from taking it.
This study included adult patients with ATTR-PN who had participated in prior studies with tafamidis and never had a heart or liver transplant. All patients in this study received tafamidis 20 milligrams, taken once per day every day by mouth. Patients were asked to attend clinic visits every 6 months, and were contacted by phone 3 months after each clinic visit. There was also a follow-up contact 30 days after patients stopped taking tafamidis to check for any medical problems. This was an "open-label" study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew what medicine was being given.
