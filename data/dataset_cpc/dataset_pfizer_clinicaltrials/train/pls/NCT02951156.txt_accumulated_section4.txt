Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (or "DLBCL") is a kind of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is the most common type of blood cancer. DLBCL happens when cells of the immune system, known as B-cells, grow and multiply uncontrollably. DLBCL occurs mostly in adults and is a fast-growing (aggressive) lymphoma. While there are treatments available for DLBCL, some patients' cancer does not get better or gets worse over time. Researchers are looking for new and better treatments that can be combined with other medicines to help keep patients' DLBCL from getting worse over time.
Avelumab and utomilumab were investigational treatments for DLBCL when this study began. Both of these treatments are a type of protein called "monoclonal antibodies", and they are thought to work by helping the cells of the immune system fight cancer cells. Although avelumab is approved for use in other types of cancer under the brand name BavencioÂ®, it is not approved for use in DLBCL.
The medicines rituximab, azacitidine, and bendamustine are commonly used to treat DLBCL, but these medicines may not work well for all patients. Patients whose DLBCL did not get better with approved cancer treatments are said to have "refractory" DLBCL. Patients whose DLBCL got better after treatment but later got worse are said to have "relapsed" DLBCL.
This study was divided into 2 parts, or "phases". The main purpose of the first phase of the study (Phase 1) was to learn about the effects of avelumab when given with other investigational or approved cancer therapies. This information would determine the best treatment combination to use in the second phase of the study (Phase 3). To do this, the researchers asked:
