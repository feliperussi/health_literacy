Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the outer layer of the skin and the mouth, nose, and throat. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer found in the head and neck.
Researchers are looking for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called "Programmed Death-Ligand 1" (PD-L1) found on the cancer cell. PD-L1 is involved in the body's immune system response to cancer.
When this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Locally advanced refers to cancer that has spread to nearby body tissues. Although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in head and neck cancer.
The standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck includes a combination of radiation therapy and a chemotherapy medicine called cisplatin. The main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) before, during, and after standard treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress). The study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
This study included 2 groups of patients taking either:
- Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab
- Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine and is given the same way.
The study included adult patients who:
- had squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (in the mouth or throat) that was locally advanced
- had cancer that was likely to spread or come back after treatment
- were appropriate to receive standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin
- had not yet received treatment for their cancer
- had adequate liver, kidney, and bone marrow function
The patients and researchers did not know who took avelumab and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double-blinded” study.
Potential patients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to participate in the study. This was known as the “screening period”. Next, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
- Group A (350 patients): Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab
- Group B (347 patients): Standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo
Patients were assigned to each group by chance. Putting people into groups by chance is called randomization. This helps make it more likely that the groups will be more even to compare before they start receiving the study treatments.
Avelumab and placebo were given by intravenous (IV) infusion (a needle into a vein). The study included 3 treatment phases:
- 7-day Lead-In Phase: Patients received a single dose of avelumab or placebo on day 1
- Chemoradiotherapy Phase: Patients received avelumab or placebo on Days 8, 25, or 39 plus standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment
- Maintenance Phase: Patients received avelumab or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months
Maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has been treated in the initial phase.
After the last dose of maintenance treatment, there was a 90-day follow-up period that included regular safety assessments. There was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended.
Patients were expected to be on treatment for about 15 months, but the entire study lasted about 3 years. The sponsor ran this study at 196 locations in 22 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The first patient was enrolled on 12 December 2016. 575 men (82%) and 122 women (18%) joined the study. Patients in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86.
