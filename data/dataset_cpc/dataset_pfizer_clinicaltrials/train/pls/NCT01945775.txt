Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths in women. In 2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease. Some people carry changes or "mutations" in their DNA in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes 1 and 2, or "BRCA1" and "BRCA2". BRCA gene mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline). When a person's BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer. Researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations that can help them have more time without their cancer getting worse.
Talazoparib (Talzenna®) is a drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins called "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases", also called "PARPs". PARPs are proteins (made from genes which are part of DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA (like cells with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations) that do not die can become cancer cells. Clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other PARP inhibitors, can reduce tumor size or delay the cancer getting worse, and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. Talazoparib is now approved in the United States, the European Union, and other countries for the treatment of patients with a certain type of breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumor ("advanced") or has spread to other parts of the body ("metastatic") and have an inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. This study was done to see if talazoparib treatment could help patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and have inherited a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, have more time without their cancer getting worse when compared to commonly used chemotherapies.
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib. They monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study.

This study compared two groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazoparib had more time without their cancer getting worse compared to patients taking other commonly used chemotherapies. 

The study included patients who:
- Were at least 18 years old
- Had breast cancer that was advanced or had spread to other parts of the body 
  (also called “metastatic cancer”)
- Inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation
- Did not have more than 3 chemotherapy treatments for their advanced cancer
- Had previously taken at least one of the commonly used cancer chemotherapies
- Had good organ function and adequate blood counts

This trial was an open-label study. This means that both the patient and the doctor knew whether the patient received talazoparib or chemotherapy.

Patients joined the study at one of 145 locations in the US, Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, Israel, Russia, and Ukraine), Brazil, South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan. It began on 14 October 2013 and ended on 05 March 2021. A total of 7 men and 424 women participated in this study. All patients were between the ages of 24 and 88. Patients were to be treated until their doctor determined that their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, or until they chose to stop participation in the study. All of the 431 patients who started the study had stopped treatment by the end of the study, mostly due to the patient’s cancer getting worse, the patient chose to stop, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop their assigned treatment.

The Sponsor reviewed the study results in September 2017, September 2019, and March 2021. The Sponsor then created reports of the results collected up to those time points. This is a summary of those reports.
