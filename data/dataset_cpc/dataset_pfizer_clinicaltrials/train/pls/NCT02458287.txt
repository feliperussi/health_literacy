Heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. One of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high "bad" cholesterol (called LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Having high LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease. 
Doctors prescribe medicines called "statins" to patients with high LDL cholesterol to lower the LDL cholesterol in the blood. For some people, statins may not lower cholesterol enough. 
Researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients who are taking a statin and who still have LDL cholesterol above what their doctors consider ideal. Bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. It is not a statin. 
Bococizumab is a medicine that is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) which may help to lower LDL cholesterol. 
In most studies with bococizumab, patients had to use a pre-filled syringe to inject the medicine. The Sponsor developed a more automated way of giving an injection using a device called a pre-filled pen (autoinjector). For this study, researchers wanted to test the pre-filled pen as a new way to give this medicine. 
For this study, researchers wanted to know: 
- Does bococizumab help to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who are taking a statin and who still have LDL cholesterol above ideal levels? 
- How well can patients (or a helper) use a pre-filled pen to inject bococizumab?
