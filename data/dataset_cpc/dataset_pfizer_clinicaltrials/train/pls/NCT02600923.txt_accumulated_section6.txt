Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women and there were over 2 million new cases worldwide in 2018. Lots of different types of breast cancer exist, so a range of treatment options are needed. One treatment option for a specific type of advanced or "metastatic" breast cancer is IBRANCE® (palbociclib). Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. IBRANCE (palbociclib) treatment was first approved for use in 2015. The researchers did this study so that they could offer patients with specific types of advanced breast cancer treatment with palbociclib if this treatment was not commercially approved or if patients were not eligible for clinical trials. This study ended when palbociclib became commercially available in participating countries and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients.
This study provided palbociclib alongside letrozole therapy to all patients who entered the study as follows:
- Palbociclib 125 mg once a day for 21 days and then nothing for 7 days every 28-day cycle, and
- Letrozole 2.5 mg once a day throughout the study. 
The study provided access to palbociclib for patients who were post-menopausal women with “hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive)” and “human epidermal growth factor-negative (HER2-negative)” advanced breast cancer and who lived in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer means that the cancer can grow and spread if certain “hormones” are present. Hormones are chemicals produced in the body that carry messages from one area to another. If the chemical messenger comes into contact with the cancer cell, then sometimes, if the cancer is positive for that chemical messenger, the cancer will grow and spread. For patients in this study, their cancer would grow and spread if female hormones (estrogen and progesterone) were present in their blood. Palbociclib is one option available to patients with HR-positive breast cancer.
