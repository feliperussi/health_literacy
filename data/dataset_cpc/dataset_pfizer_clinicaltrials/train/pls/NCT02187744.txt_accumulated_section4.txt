Some women with breast cancer have high levels of a certain protein receptor on the surface of their cancer cells. This protein is called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). A cell with too many HER2 receptors is stimulated to grow and multiply too fast and can become a cancer. When women with breast cancer have too much of this protein, their cancer is called "HER2-positive".
Trastuzumab is an approved drug for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive cancer and has been available for patient use by prescription for several years. The name for trastuzumab, which is approved for sale, is Herceptin®. PF-05280014 was the investigational drug in this study. An investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale.
Researchers think that PF-05280014 works like Herceptin® in the body. Herceptin® is an antibody, which is a type of protein. Herceptin® binds to the HER2 receptor on the surface of cells. By attaching to the HER2 receptor, this medicine can block the signals that cause the cells to grow and multiply.
Patients who were in this study received either PF-05280014 or Herceptin® in combination with Taxotere® and carboplatin. Taxotere® and carboplatin are standard chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer. They were used in this study because they are commonly given to patients by doctors for the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, women were given these medicines as a first step to shrink the tumor before surgery (neoadjuvant). All women in this study were planned to have surgery after treatment.
