Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in 1% to 3% of adults and 15% to 20% of children worldwide. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD.
The drug tested in this study was PF-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. Abrocitinib is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale. Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", which acts like a switch for the cells of the immune system. By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make AD worse. The researchers wanted to ask:
- Are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo?
To do this, researchers used 2 tests to measure the severity of each patient's AD at the beginning of the study. The researchers measured the severity of AD during 12 weeks of study treatment. The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient's AD had improved or not.
This study compared three groups of patients to find out if patients taking abrocitinib had their AD improved compared to patients taking placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. The study included adult men and women, and adolescents who were aged 12 years and older. Patients included in the study:

-Had chronic (long-term) AD for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe AD when they entered the study.
-Also had one of the following: 
-Had been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines applied to the skin, and their AD did not get better;
-Were unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical problem;
-Needed to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their AD (for example, taking medicines by mouth).

The patients and researchers did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg, or placebo. Patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving abrocitinib and a 20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. This is known as a “randomized” study. 

This study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment. The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment scale and measures the severity of AD on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). The second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.

While patients were only in the study for 12 weeks, the entire study took 14 months to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 106 locations in 13 countries in the United States, Poland, Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, China, Latvia, Hungary, and Czech Republic. It began on 29 June 2018 and ended on 13 August 2019. A total of 229 men or boys and 162 women or girls participated. All patients were 12 years of age or older. The average age of patients in this study was 31 years. Approximately 10% of the patients were between the ages of 12 and 18.

Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12-week treatment period. Of the 391 patients who started the study, 52 out of 78 patients (67%) that received placebo finished the study, 137 out of 158 patients (87%) that received 100 mg abrocitinib finished the study, and 141 out of 155 patients (91%) that received 200 mg abrocitinib finished the study. Some patients did not finish the study because 26 out of 78 patients (33%) on placebo, 21 out of 158 patients (13%) on 100 mg abrocitinib, and 14 out of 155 patients (9%) on 200 mg abrocitinib left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study.

When the study ended in August 2019, the Sponsor began reviewing the information collected. The sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
