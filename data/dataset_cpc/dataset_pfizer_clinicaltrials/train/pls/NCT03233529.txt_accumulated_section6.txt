Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing. The symptoms can look different on different people. Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. There is no known cure for this condition. People with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have "flare ups", when their symptoms worsen for a time.
Researchers are looking for treatments for atopic dermatitis. Crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. It is applied to the skin as an ointment. Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin. Inflammation is the body's immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about how crisaborole works by taking skin samples to analyze for "biomarkers", which are special substances in the skin related to inflammation. Researchers wanted to answer these main questions:
- Did atopic dermatitis "biomarkers" change in areas of skin that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain ointment?
- Did symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve in areas of skin that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain ointment?
This study included patients who were treated with both crisaborole and plain ointment on 2 different areas of the skin. The areas of skin were then compared to see if atopic dermatitis symptoms would improve in the areas that were treated with crisaborole. The study included adult patients with atopic dermatitis. To join the study, patients must have had at least 2 areas of atopic dermatitis that were 3 centimeters x 3 centimeters or larger, and at least 5 centimeters apart. Symptoms must have started at least 6 months before the study began, and must have been stable for at least 1 month.
