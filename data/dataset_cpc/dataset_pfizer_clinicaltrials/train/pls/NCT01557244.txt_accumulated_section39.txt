Neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or "NDO", is a bladder condition associated with damage to the nervous system. NDO may be caused by injury or disease to the spinal cord, including certain conditions that are present from birth. People with NDO may not be able to control their bladder and may not be able to hold as much urine in their bladder as other people can, so they may have urine leakage or need to urinate frequently. Additionally, NDO can cause damage to the kidneys and urinary tract if it goes unchecked. 
Current treatment options are limited for children and adolescents with NDO, so researchers are looking for new medicines that may help young people with this condition. Fesoterodine was the investigational medicine tested in this study. Fesoterodine has not been approved for use in children or adolescents, outside of research studies like this one. 
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use and safety of fesoterodine in children and adolescents with NDO. Researchers asked this main question:
- Did bladder capacity increase following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine? 
To answer this question, the researchers measured each patient's bladder capacity (maximum volume of urine that can be held in the bladder before the patient needs to urinate) 2 times: before the patients started study medicine, and again after the patient had taken study medicine for 12 weeks. They compared each patient's first result to their second result.
This study was done to find out if patients would have increased bladder capacity (be able to hold more urine) following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine, compared to before they started taking study medicine. Some of the patients were also compared to patients taking a medicine called oxybutynin XL. Oxybutynin XL was selected to be the comparator medicine because it is widely used to treat NDO in children and adolescents. 
This study included children and adolescents who:
- Were aged 6 to 17 years
- Were diagnosed with NDO
- Had stable nervous system disease, which means that their nervous system disease was not getting worse
- Were checked by the study doctor for other health conditions, and were determined to be appropriate to join the study
The study included 4 parts:
- A run-in period before the study started. Patients were screened by the study doctors to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. No study medicines were given during this period.
- An efficacy phase for the first 12 weeks of study treatment, when the researchers evaluated how well fesoterodine works, along with its safety.
- A safety extension phase for the last 12 weeks of study treatment, when the researchers continued to evaluate the safety of fesoterodine.
- A 2-week follow-up phase at the end of the study.
Children and adolescents in this study were divided into 2 groups, based on weight:
- Group 1 (124 patients): Patients weighing more than 25 kilograms (about 55pounds)
- Group 2 (57 patients): Patients weighing 25 kilograms or less
Patients from Group 1 were assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 
- Fesoterodine 4 milligram (mg) tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks)
- Fesoterodine 8 mg tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks)
- Oxybutynin XL tablets for the efficacy phase (12 weeks). These patients were then switched to fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets for the safety extension phase (12 weeks) (40 patients).
The patients were assigned to receive the treatments by chance alone, which is known as a randomized study. This is done to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of boys and girls), makes the groups more even to compare.
Patients from Group 2 were assigned by chance alone to receive 1 of 2 treatments for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks): 
- Fesoterodine 2 mg capsules (28 patients)
- Fesoterodine 4 mg capsules (29 patients)
This was an open-label study, which means that the patients, their families, and the study doctors knew which medicine the patients were taking.
Patients were expected to come to 8 study visits. They were checked by study doctors at each visit, to monitor for safety of the study medicines. Bladder capacity was measured before the patients started study medicines, and again after they had been on the study medicines for 12 weeks.
Patients were expected to be in this study for about 26 weeks (24 weeks of treatment plus a 2 -week follow-up period). The Sponsor ran this study at 102 locations in 28 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The entire study took more than 7 years to complete. It began on 2 July 2012 and ended on 13 February 2020. A total of 95 boys (52%) and 86 girls (48%) participated in the study. All patients were between the ages of 6 and 17 years.
