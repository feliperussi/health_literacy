People with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy have higher than normal levels of a particular protein in their heart. This increases the risk of having heart problems, like heart failure.
Tafamidis is a study drug that is being tested for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Tafamidis is currently approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in Japan and the United States. Tafamidis is not approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in other countries because it is still being tested.
This study had 2 purposes:
To understand the safety of tafamidis: to see what medical problems patients had during the study
To look at controlling transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: to see if patients taking tafamidis were less likely to have a stay in the hospital and less likely to die earlier because of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
This study compared patients who received tafamidis with patients who received placebo, to understand if tafamidis helped patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being studied.
This was a randomized trial, meaning patients were put randomly (by chance) into one of three groups: 
- Group 1: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 20 milligrams (mg)
- Group 2: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 80 mg
- Group 3: received a placebo that didn’t contain any drug
Putting patients into groups randomly makes comparing the groups more fair. The study included patients who had a history of heart failure due to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. The patients and researchers did not know who took tafamidis and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. This means that neither the patients nor doctors knew which drug the patients actually got.
