What is Group B Streptococcus?
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a germ (bacteria) that may cause serious disease, 
including sepsis (a systemic inflammatory reaction that may affect several organs in 
the body), meningitis (infections of the lining covering the brain and spinal cord), and 
pneumonia (lung infection).
What is GBS6?
Group B streptococcus 6-valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (GBS6) is a vaccine 
under development to prevent disease caused by 6 different types of GBS infection.  
Vaccines help a person's body with the ability to prevent infection from GBS using 
the body's disease-fighting system (immune response). GBS6 is made from a 
weakened part of the germ (sugar coat of bacteria) added to a separate stronger carrier 
protein which helps increase the body's immune response after vaccination. 
What was the purpose of this study?
This study is a follow-up to a previous study where participants received 1 of 6 
dose/formulations of GBS6 or a placebo, approximately 2 years before this study.  
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster dose 
of GBS6, an investigational vaccine, in healthy adults. Investigational means that a 
vaccine is not approved for use in this country. Safety means that any reactions or 
medical problems that happened in the study were studied. Tolerability refers to 
whether reactions to the vaccine interfered with a participant's usual activities.
