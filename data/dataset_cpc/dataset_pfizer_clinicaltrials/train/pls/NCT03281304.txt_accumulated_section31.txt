Ulcerative colitis ("UC") is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Patients with UC experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. Flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and the presence of blood in the stools, as well as a sense of urgency. Flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years.
There is no known cure for UC. Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of UC and can even lead to long-term remission. However, there are few treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Medication is the most common treatment for UC. Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved and is available by prescription to treat adults with active, moderate to severe UC that did not respond well to other medications.
Researchers have continued to study tofacitinib to find out more about its safety and how well it works. In one study, researchers saw that participants with UC who took either 5mg or 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day were more likely to stay in remission compared to participants who took placebo. However, a formal study to compare a reduced dose of tofacitinib (5mg twice a day) to the standard dose (10mg twice a day) of tofacitinib had not been done.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out if participants with UC who were in stable remission (ongoing time with no symptoms) would stay in remission if the dose of the treatment was reduced from 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5mg of tofacitinib twice a day. Researchers wanted to answer the question:
- What difference did switching from 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5mg of tofacitinib twice a day have on the percent of participants in remission after 6 months compared to staying on 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day?
Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants who switched from 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5mg of tofacitinib twice a day compared to participants who continued to take 10mg of tofacitinib twice a day. They monitored participants for any medical problems that happened while they were taking tofacitinib.
The results for the primary endpoint (percent of participants in remission after 6 months) as well as safety results for participants from the start of the study until February 2020 (27 months) are summarized here.
This study compared two groups of participants with UC to find out how many participants who were in stable remission and switched from taking 10mg tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg tofacitinib twice a day would be in remission 6 months later compared to participants who continued to take 10mg tofacitinib twice a day. The study included participants who:
-Were participating in another study of tofacitinib (Study A3921139),
-Had been taking 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day for at least 2 years in a row,
-Were in stable remission for UC on 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day for 6 months prior to beginning this study, and
-Had not been taking any oral corticosteroids for their UC for at least 4 weeks prior to beginning this study.
Participants were put into one of two treatment groups by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study. This is done to make the groups more similar. Reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare.
This trial was also “double-blind”. This means that participants and doctors did not know who was given which dose of tofacitinib. This was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way.
Each participant in the study took 2 pills twice a day by mouth:
-5mg tofacitinib group: one 5 mg tofacitinib tablet and one placebo tablet twice a day (70 out of 140 participants in the study).
-10mg tofacitinib group: two 5 mg tofacitinib tablets twice a day (70 out of 140 participants in the study).
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. The pills for the investigational medicine looked exactly the same as the pills for the placebo. This made it so that participants did not know to which study group they were assigned.
During the entire study, participants are to come to the study site 17 times over 42 months and have their UC assessed. At 4 of these visits, participants are to have a lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) to look for swelling or unusual changes to the lining of their colon. A lower endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into the anus to view the inside of the rectum and most of the colon.
The participant’s UC disease activity was measured using a modified Mayo score. The modified Mayo score rates the activity of UC based on 3 categories. Each category is graded from 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe. The 3 categories are:
-Stool frequency (how many bowel movements per day?)
-Rectal bleeding (is blood seen in the stool?)
-Endoscopy results (how does the lining of the colon look?)
The scores from each of the 3 categories were added together to give the modified Mayo score. The modified Mayo score rates the disease activity of UC on a scale from 0 to 9. Participants who had a score of 0 or 1 for the endoscopy results, a stool frequency score of 0 or 1, and a score of 0 for rectal bleeding were said to be in remission. Any participant who experienced a worsening of their UC disease activity (flares) was allowed to have their dose adjusted during the study.
