This study was done to find out if an experimental vaccine might prevent meningococcal B disease. Meningococcal disease is an infection that causes the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord to become swollen and inflamed. It is caused by a germ called "meningococcus." There are different types of the meningococcal germ: types A, B, C, and Y. The type B meningococcal germ causes more meningococcal disease than any other type of meningococcal germ. While the likelihood of getting meningococcal B disease is very low, children under the age of 4 years are more likely to get it than any other age group. Vaccines are given to prevent people from getting infections, and they work by helping people to fight off germs. While there are vaccines available to prevent other types of meningococcal disease, there isn't one available worldwide to prevent meningococcal B disease. The vaccine given in this study is an injectable called bivalent rLP2086. This study tested bivalent rLP2086 to see if it will help people fight off the meningococcal B germ and provide protection (immunity) against the disease. This could only be done by testing the vaccine in healthy people who have never had an infection with meningococcal disease before. As this disease is most common in babies and toddlers, the vaccine was tested in this age group. This study was done to see if toddlers made immune system proteins, called antibodies, after receiving bivalent rLP2086. Antibodies help the body to fight off diseases, in this case, group B meningococcal disease. Researchers also wanted to see what side effects toddlers have after receiving bivalent rLP2086 compared to a pediatric hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine. Bivalent rLP2086 is being compared to HAV because HAV is already widely used and the side effects of HAV are well known. 090177e1905cbe79\Approved\Approved On: 14-Feb-2019 10:25 (GMT) 3
This study compared three groups of children to find out if toddlers made immune system proteins, called antibodies, after taking bivalent rLP2086, and how the side effects compared to taking HAV plus placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. Children in both age groups were put into one of three study groups by chance alone. This is known as a “randomized” study, and is done to reduce differences between the study groups. Reducing differences between groups makes comparing the groups more fair.
In two of the three groups, children received the experimental vaccine bivalent rLP2086. One group received a 60 µg dose of bivalent rLP2086, and the second group received a 120µg dose. The third group received HAV and a placebo. About 64% (6 out of 10) of children received bivalent rLP2086 and 33% (3 of 10) received HAV plus placebo. Researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine is safe and works better than not taking anything.
The study included children who were aged 12 months to less than 24 months. This study was done in two stages. In Stage 1, your child was followed for about 18 months. During Stage 1, each child received three injections, at one of two different dose levels (60 µg or 120 µg) of investigational bivalent rLP2086, or HAV and placebo. The injections were given at:
- Visit 1 (Day 1)
- Visit 4 (Month 2). Children who were randomized to receive HAV received a placebo (sterile saline) injection at this visit.
- Visit 6 (Month 6)
Only children who were originally randomized to the bivalent rLP2086 group in Stage 1 were eligible to be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study. In Stage 2, your child was followed for about 2 years. This stage measured how long the immune response lasted after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086.
While patients were only in the study for about 18 months, stage 1 of the study took two years to complete. Patients joined the study at one of 25 locations in Australia, Czechia, Finland, and Poland. It began 31 August 2015 and is ongoing. 396 children participated. All children were between the ages of 12 months and 24 months. Children were supposed to be treated until all vaccinations had been given. Of the 396 children who started the study, 381 completed the study. 15 did not finish the study.
