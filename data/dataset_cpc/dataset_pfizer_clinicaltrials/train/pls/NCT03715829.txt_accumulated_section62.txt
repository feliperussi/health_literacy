What is vitiligo?
Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder that causes a patchy loss of skin color. This loss of 
skin color could be focused in one area of the body for some people (called 
“segmental vitiligo”) or could be located over various areas of the body for other 
people (called “non-segmental vitiligo”). Melanin is the name for a pigment that is 
found in the skin and is responsible for skin color. Melanin is made by certain types 
of cells in the body called melanocytes. In people with vitiligo, the skin loses these 
melanocytes, resulting in the patchy loss of skin color.
What are ritlecitinib and brepocitinib?
Ritlecitinib and brepocitinib are investigational treatments that are being studied for 
active, non-segmental vitiligo. An investigational treatment is one that is still being 
studied and is not approved for use outside of research studies. Ritlecitinib and 
brepocitinib may block the activity of certain cells and molecules that are responsible 
for the loss of melanocytes in the skin.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of ritlecitinib and 
brepocitinib in people with active, non-segmental vitiligo. 
Researchers wanted to know:
During Part 1, did participants have an improvement in facial 
vitiligo after taking study treatment for 24 weeks?

How was the study done?
Researchers studied different doses of ritlecitinib and placebo in a group of study participants. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study treatment. Researchers also studied a dose regimen of brepocitinib in a group of study participants during an extension period. The study participants and researchers did not know who took which study treatment/dose, and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. The study treatments were given as tablets. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone.
Participants were screened by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. This study was done in 2 parts. Part 1 lasted 24 weeks, and looked at the safety and effects of different doses of ritlecitinib. Participants were assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups:
- Part 1 Group 1 (65 participants): Ritlecitinib 200 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks
- Part 1 Group 2 (67 participants): Ritlecitinib 100 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks
- Part 1 Group 3 (67 participants): Ritlecitinib 50 mg for 24 weeks
- Part 1 Group 4 (50 participants): Ritlecitinib 30 mg for 24 weeks
- Part 1 Group 5 (49 participants): Ritlecitinib 10 mg for 24 weeks
- Part 1 Group 6 (66 participants): Placebo
Participants who completed Part 1 were eligible to join Part 2. This part of the study lasted 24 weeks, and looked at the safety of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib. During Part 2, some participants also received treatment with ultraviolet light. Participants were assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups based on how they had responded to treatment during Part 1. Groups 1, 2, and 6 were “unblinded”, which means that the study participants and researchers knew who took which study treatment/dose, and who took the placebo. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were blinded:
- Part 2 Group 1 (55 participants): No treatment for 4 weeks (to allow the body to clear up any effects of the study treatments given during Part 1), followed by brepocitinib 60 mg for 4 weeks, followed by brepocitinib 30mg for 16 weeks
- Part 2 Group 2 (43 participants): Ritlecitinib 200 mg plus ultraviolet (UV) light treatment for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg plus ultraviolet light treatment for 20 weeks
- Part 2 Group 3 (187 participants): Ritlecitinib 200 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks
- Part 2 Group 4 (6 participants): Ritlecitinib 50 mg for 24 weeks
- Part 2 Group 5 (2 participants): Ritlecitinib 30 mg for 24 weeks
- Part 2 Group 6 (0 participants): No treatment (observation only for 24 weeks)
Participants from Groups 1 to 5 entered an 8-week follow-up period after they completed Part 2. Participants were also expected to attend up to 19 visits at the study center. The figure below shows what happened during the study.
Where did this study take place?
The Sponsor ran this study at 80 locations in 10 countries.
When did this study take place?
It began 26 November 2018 and ended 5 February 2021.
Who participated in this study?
The study included men and women with active, non-segmental vitiligo. Participants agreed to use contraception during the course of the study.
- A total of 171 men (47%) participated.
- A total of 193 women (53%) participated.
- All participants were between the ages of 18 and 66.
A total of 366 participants joined Part 1, and 364 participants received study treatment. Of these 364 participants, 43 (12%) left during Part 1 by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. 321 participants (88%) completed this part of the study.
