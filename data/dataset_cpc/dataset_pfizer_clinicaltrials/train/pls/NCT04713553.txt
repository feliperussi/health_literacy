What is COVID-19? 
A new respiratory disease appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since 
rapidly spread to many other countries around the world. In January 2020, the cause 
of this disease was found to be a new Coronavirus; and the disease it causes was 
named COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Since then, many companies around 
the world have quickly started to look for ways to prevent COVID-19 disease. 
People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. 
COVID-19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system, but it can also affect other 
organs in the body. COVID-19 can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, 
cough, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of taste or smell. COVID-19 symptoms 
can sometimes be severe.
What are BNT162b2 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines? 
A vaccine is used to help the body to fight off germs. After a vaccine is injected into a 
person's body, the body responds by making "antibodies", which are proteins that 
fight infections and help to prevent disease. This is known as the body's "immune 
response".
The BNT162b2 investigational vaccine does not contain the whole virus, or the 
parts of the virus that can cause COVID-19. Instead, BNT162b2 is made up of part 
of the virus's genetic code, surrounded by fatty particles called lipids. It uses the 
body's own cells to produce a "spike protein". This spike protein may help the body 
to produce antibodies to fight against COVID-19. 
At the time of this study, BNT162b2 was an investigational vaccine and it was not 
approved for general use. BNT162b2 has now been approved for use in many 
countries worldwide. BNT162b2 is given as 2 doses, about 3 weeks apart.

What was the purpose of this study? 
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the body's 
immune response to 4 different batches, or "lots", of the BNT162b2 vaccine, given at 
2 different doses. Three of the lots were intended for use in the United States (US 
lot), and 1 lot was intended for use in the European Union (EU lot). All 4 lots 
contained the same components and were made in the same way. The researchers 
needed to compare the investigational vaccines from the different lots and doses to be 
sure that they worked the same way and were safe to use. 
Researchers wanted to know: 
Did participants who received vaccines from the 3 US lots have 
similar immune responses? 
Did participants who received a low-dose vaccine have similar 
immune responses to participants who received a standard-dose 
vaccine from the same lot? 
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
Did participants who received vaccines from the EU lot have 
similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines 
from the US lots? 
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after vaccination? 
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after 
vaccination?

How many participants had any medical problems within 1 month 
after their second vaccination?
How many participants had serious medical problems within 
1 month after their second vaccination? 
The researchers also studied a third ("booster") dose, given about 3 months after 
Dose 2. The main purpose of this part of the study was to learn about the safety and 
about the body's immune response to the booster dose.
Researchers wanted to know: 
Did participants have an immune response to the booster dose? 
*Results for this study question will be available at a later date.
How many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site within 7 days after the booster dose? 
How many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, 
vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after the 
booster dose? 
How many participants had any medical problems within 1 month 
after the booster dose? 
How many participants had serious medical problems within 
1 month after the booster dose?
