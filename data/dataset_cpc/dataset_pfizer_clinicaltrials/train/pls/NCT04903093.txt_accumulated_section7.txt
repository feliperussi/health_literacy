What is atopic dermatitis?
Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in 5% to 10% of adults and 15% to 20% of children worldwide. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken safely for long periods of time.
While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD.
What is abrocitinib?
The drug tested in this study was abrocitinib. Abrocitinib has been approved for sale and can be used by adults in some countries around the world. Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", which acts like a switch for the cells of the immune system. By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make AD worse.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of abrocitinib seen in the blood after participants had taken abrocitinib tablets, abrocitinib liquid, and abrocitinib tablets taken 2 hours after the medicine famotidine. Famotidine is an antacid. It is used to treat and prevent heartburn, indigestion, and other symptoms caused by too much stomach acid such as stomach ulcers and reflux disease. The researchers did this study as they wanted to develop a new liquid preparation or formulation of abrocitinib as an alternative to taking tablets. Researchers wanted to know:
