This study included patients who:
- Were diagnosed with AML, or medium to high risk MDS or CMML, and had not received treatment for their AML, MDS, or CMML before.
- Aged â‰¥18 years.
- Had adequate liver and kidney function.
- Were appropriate for treatment with azacitidine.
- Able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% of the day (Phase 1 only).

What happened during Phase 1 of the study?
During Phase 1 of this study, 12 patients received glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The goal of Phase 1 was to learn more about the safety of glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 75 mg per square meter of body surface area, given as injections under the skin. Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 28 days. The patients were monitored for medical problems.
What happened during Phase 2 of the study?
The goal of Phase 2 was to find out how many patients would achieve complete remission. 30 patients with MDS or CMML and 30 patients with AML received glasdegib in combination with azacitidine. The starting dose of glasdegib was 100 mg in pill form, once daily by mouth for 28 days. The starting dose of azacitidine was 75mg per square meter of body surface area, given as injections under the skin or into the vein. Patients took azacitidine in cycles, which means that it was taken for only the first 7 days of each 28 days. Patients with MDS or CMML were monitored for at least 28 weeks, and patients with AML were monitored for at least 24 weeks.
