What is moderate to severe plaque psoriasis?
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by red, scaly, raised patches (plaques) that may itch or burn. Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis can greatly affect the quality of life for patients.
In clinical trials, psoriasis is measured using a tool called Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). PASI measures plaque psoriasis using the following items:
- Amount of the body (body surface area [BSA]) that has patches (plaques)
- Redness of patches
- Thickness of patches
- Level (degree) of scaling (extra flaky skin)
What is PF-06826647?
The study medication, PF-06826647, is a medication that researchers think may help with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. PF-06826647 blocks a small protein (called tyrosine kinase 2; TYK2) that may cause inflammation and skin patches. When there are too many TYK2 proteins, inflammation and skin patches develop, as seen in psoriasis.
What was the purpose of this study?
- The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of multiple dose levels of PF-06826647 versus placebo. Efficacy means how well a drug improves a disease or condition. This study measured the proportion (how many out of the total) of participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had a reduction in their patches by 90% (90 out of 100) from the beginning of the study to Week 16. This measurement is called PASI90 (that means 90% or more PASI score reduction) for this study.
- This study compared the effects of the study drug, PF-06826647, or a placebo to find out which improves moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
- Other purposes of this study were to provide additional safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data. PK data means what amount of PF-06826647 was in the blood at various times.
- Previous studies of PF-06826647 showed adequate safety and improvement of plaque psoriasis to support progression into additional clinical trials requiring longer-term therapy. This study explored whether an oral tablet containing PF-06826647 improves the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe psoriasis.
- A placebo was used as the comparator to the study drug. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine.
How was the study done? Researchers tested PF-06826647 in groups of study participants during 2 periods of time: an Investigational Treatment Period (Weeks 0-16) and an Extension Treatment Period (Weeks 16 -40). 
- Participants were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 4 doses of study medication (PF-06826647, oral daily dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400mg) during the Investigational Treatment Period for up to 16 weeks. Randomization means that participants were assigned to a treatment group by chance. Twice as many participants were assigned to the placebo, PF-06826647 200 mg, or PF-06826647 400 mg groups compared to the PF-06826647 50 mg or PF-06826647 100 mg groups.
