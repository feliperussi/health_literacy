"Venous thromboembolism," or VTE, is the name for a blood clot that forms in the body. VTE can happen in a vein located in different parts of the body, including the legs, the arms, the groin, the lungs, or other parts of the body. A VTE can be life-threatening if not treated.
Certain children may be more likely to have a VTE, such as those with cancer or other serious conditions that require hospitalization. VTE may be treated or prevented with a type of medicine called an "anticoagulant," also known as a "blood thinner." One anticoagulant that is used is called dalteparin. It is given as an injection under the skin. Dalteparin has been approved for use in adults with VTE in the United States and Europe, but has not been approved in children because additional studies are needed to find out if dalteparin could be a useful medicine for children.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children with or without cancer, and to help determine the appropriate dose of dalteparin for treating VTE in children. The study doctors collected blood samples from the children and did a blood test to find out what the "anti-Xa level" was after certain doses of dalteparin were given. The Anti-Xa level shows how well dalteparin makes blood clots go away or stops a blood clot from forming.
Specifically, the study doctors wanted to answer these questions:
• What effect would dalteparin, given at different doses, have on the bodies of children, including children with cancer and children without cancer?
• What would be the average dalteparin dose required to treat VTE in children, based on age and weight?
• How long did it take the children's anti-Xa test results to reach target levels?
This study was done to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children who have a VTE. The children who entered the study had to have VTE, and may also have had a type of cancer. First, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. This was called “screening”. The children were grouped by age:
