This study compared boys taking domagrozumab or placebo. The study included boys with DMD who were able to walk, and were at least 6 but younger than 16 years old when the study began. 
First, boys were screened by the study doctors. Certain tests were done to make sure the boys were a good fit to join the study.  
Next, boys were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Boys were assigned to each group by chance alone. Putting boys into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. The study was done in 2 parts, so that each boy would receive domagrozumab during part of the study. Each part lasted about 48 weeks. The boys, their parents, and the researchers did not know who took domagrozumab and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Boys were assigned to each group by chance alone.
Group 1: 41 Boys
- Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight (mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg
- Part 2: Domagrozumab 40 mg/kg
Group 2: 39 Boys
- Part 1: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg
- Part 2: Placebo
Group 3: 40 Boys
- Part 1: Placebo
- Part 2: Domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg
All study drugs were given as an IV infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein.
When they came to study visits, boys were asked to complete questionnaires about their DMD symptoms and do tests, like the 4 Stair Climb test.
Finally, boys were asked to participate in 2 follow-up visits after they stopped study treatment. The figure on the following page shows what happened during this study.
While boys were in the study for less than 2 years, the entire study took about 4 years to complete. The sponsor ran this study at 35 locations in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Italy, Japan, Poland, United Kingdom, and United States. It began 24 November 2014 and ended 23 November 2018. All 120 participants were boys between the ages of 6 and 15.
Boys were to complete Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, and participate in 2 follow-up visits. Of the 120 boys who entered the study and received study treatment, 65 boys (54%) completed it. 55 boys (46%) did not complete the study by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a boy to stop the study, or because the Sponsor decided to stop the study early.
The Sponsor decided to stop the study early in November 2018, because results did not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab. After the study ended, the Sponsor then created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
