What is Streptococcus pneumoniae?
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections 
of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis).
These infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. Streptococcus 
pneumoniae is also known as S pneumoniae. There are about 100 types of S pneumoniae.
What is the c7vPnC vaccine?
This study is about a vaccine called the "complementary 7-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine", or c7vPnC. A vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping 
the body to fight off germs. c7vPnC may help to prevent infections caused by 
S pneumoniae. It is called "7-valent" because it has the potential to prevent 7 common 
types of S pneumoniae. 
It is referred to as "complementary" as it is expected to be used with Prevnar 13®, a 
vaccine approved in the United States that is made up of components to prevent 
disease caused by 13 types of S pneumoniae. 
When used together, c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 could have the potential to prevent 
disease caused by 20 different types of S pneumoniae. 
c7vPnC is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for 
general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by 
S pneumoniae.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of c7vPnC in healthy 
infants, when given with or separately from Prevnar 13.

Researchers wanted to know:
- How many of the infants in the study:
o Had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of each 
vaccination?
o Had fever, low appetite, sleepiness, or irritability within 7 days after each 
vaccination? 
o Had medical problems from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, and from 
Dose 4 or the supplemental dose to 1 month after?
o Had serious medical problems or any newly diagnosed chronic medical 
problems during the study?
How was the study done?
Researchers studied c7vPnC in a group of healthy infants to find out if infants had any health problems when given c7vPnC with or separately from Prevnar 13:
- When given both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age
- When given Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, and c7vPnC at 3, 5, 7, and 13 months of age (every other month from Prevnar 13). 
Researchers then compared the results of infants getting both c7vPnC and Prevnar 13 (given either together or separately) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age to the results of infants getting Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and a supplemental dose of c7vPnC at 13 months of age. In this study, Prevnar 13 was used for comparison because it is an approved and recommended vaccine for use in infants for preventing S pneumoniae diseases. It was given to all infants in the study. 
The families of the infants and the researchers knew which infants were given c7vPnC at the same time as Prevnar 13, every other month (separately) from Prevnar 13, or as a supplemental dose after the 4 doses of Prevnar 13. This is known as an “open label” study. Infants were assigned to each group by chance alone. All infants had an equal chance of being assigned to each group.
