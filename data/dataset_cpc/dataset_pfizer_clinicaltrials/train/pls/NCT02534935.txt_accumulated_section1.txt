This study was done to find out if an experimental vaccine might prevent meningococcal B disease. Meningococcal disease is an infection that causes the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord to become swollen and inflamed. It is caused by a germ called "meningococcus." There are different types of the meningococcal germ: types A, B, C, and Y. The type B meningococcal germ causes more meningococcal disease than any other type of meningococcal germ. While the likelihood of getting meningococcal B disease is very low, children under the age of 4 years are more likely to get it than any other age group. Vaccines are given to prevent people from getting infections, and they work by helping people to fight off germs. While there are vaccines available to prevent other types of meningococcal disease, there isn't one available worldwide to prevent meningococcal B disease. The vaccine given in this study is an injectable called bivalent rLP2086. This study tested bivalent rLP2086 to see if it will help people fight off the meningococcal B germ and provide protection (immunity) against the disease. This could only be done by testing the vaccine in healthy people who have never had an infection with meningococcal disease before. As this disease is most common in babies and toddlers, the vaccine was tested in this age group. This study was done to see if toddlers made immune system proteins, called antibodies, after receiving bivalent rLP2086. Antibodies help the body to fight off diseases, in this case, group B meningococcal disease. Researchers also wanted to see what side effects toddlers have after receiving bivalent rLP2086 compared to a pediatric hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine. Bivalent rLP2086 is being compared to HAV because HAV is already widely used and the side effects of HAV are well known. 090177e1905cbe79\Approved\Approved On: 14-Feb-2019 10:25 (GMT) 3
