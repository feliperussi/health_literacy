Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time. This can cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the affected joints. It can also cause "bone spurs", or extra pieces of bone, to form around the joints.
There is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe medicines to manage pain and other symptoms. These medicines may not work well for all patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. Tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis. Because it is still being tested, tanezumab has not been approved for use in patients.
The main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat osteoarthritis symptoms. The researchers wanted to answer this question:
- Did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo?
A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. A placebo is also known as a "dummy drug".
This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms. To answer the research question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions:
- Change in amount of pain due to osteoarthritis, from before study treatment to week 24 of the study.
- Change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteoarthritis, from before study treatment to week 24 of the study.
- Change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 24 of the study.
The study included adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or unwilling to take certain other pain medicines. First, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate to join the study. This was known as the “screening period”, which lasted up to 37 days. During this time, X-rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was assessed.
The next part of the study was the “treatment period”, which lasted 24 weeks. Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in very similar numbers. Patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared.
Study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Patients received a total of 3 injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study, a second one at week 8, and a third one at week 16.
The study treatments included:
- Group 1: Tanezumab 2.5 mg
- Group 2: Tanezumab 5 mg
- Group 3: Placebo
The patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and who took the placebo (dummy drug), since all treatment options looked the same. This is known as a “blinded” study. At study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarthritis, physical disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well-being that were used to answer the research question. They also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study doctors and other qualified personnel.
Finally, there was a follow-up period, which lasted 24 weeks. During this time, the study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems. Patients did not receive study treatments during the follow-up period. The figure below shows what happened during this study.
While patients were only in the study for about 48 weeks, the entire study took about 2 ½ years to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 104 locations in Europe and Japan. It began 2 March 2016 and ended 14 November 2018. 262 men (31%) and 587 women (69%) participated. All patients were between the ages of 26 and 89.
