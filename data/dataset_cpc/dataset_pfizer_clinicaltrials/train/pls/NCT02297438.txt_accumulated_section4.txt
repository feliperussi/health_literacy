What is Advanced Breast Cancer?
Sometimes, breast cancer can spread from the breast to other parts of the body, most often to the bones, lungs, liver, or brain. This is called advanced breast cancer. Advanced breast cancer cannot be treated by surgery or radiation therapy with the intention to cure the cancer, but to slow down the development of the cancer and help the patient live longer. The participants in this study had estrogen receptor-positive [ER(+)] breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative [HER2(-)] advanced breast cancer. The cells of ER(+) breast cancer have receptors that allow them to use the hormone estrogen to grow and HER2(-) means that the participants have a normal amount of HER2 proteins in the breast cells (too much of this protein means that there is another type of cancer present). This type [ER(+), HER2(-)] of advanced breast cancer is sensitive to hormonal treatment.
What is Palbociclib?
Palbociclib is a medicine that has been used to treat a specific type of breast cancer known as hormone receptor positive [HR(+)] and HER2(-). A hormone receptor is a receptor molecule that binds to a specific hormone. A breast cancer is classified as HR(+) if its cells have receptors for the hormones; estrogen and progesterone. Palbociclib targets the functioning of specific proteins or enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6). These enzymes are important for normal cell division and when they are damaged, they may cause cancer cells to grow and spread. Certain cancers, for example, ER(+), are more likely to have disturbances in CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib prevents the CDK4 and CDK6 enzymes from functioning which stops the cells from dividing and stops the growth of breast cancer cells.
