How was the study done? In this study, researchers tested 7 doses of vupanorsen on a group of participants. Researchers then compared the results of participants taking vupanorsen to the results of participants taking a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like vupanorsen. This was a “double-blind” study. This means the participants and researchers did not know which treatment the participants got. Throughout the study, participants continued to take their statin medicine. Statins belong to a class of medicine that lowers the cholesterol levels in the blood.
-On Day 1 of the study, participants got assigned to a treatment group by chance, and they took their first dose of study treatment (vupanorsen or placebo). 
-Participants then continued to take their assigned study treatment for 24 weeks. They took the study treatment either at home or at the study site. 
-Participants returned to the study site for a follow-up visit 12 weeks after their last dose. Figure 1. What happened during the study? Figure 2. What were the treatment groups?
