What is Psoriatic Arthritis? 
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a type of arthritis that affects some people with the skin 
condition psoriasis. Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply faster than normal, which 
makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. PsA 
typically causes affected joints to become swollen, stiff, and painful. PsA is thought 
to happen as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue and 
causing lasting inflammation. Like psoriasis, PsA is a long-term condition that can get 
progressively worse.
What is PF-06700841? 
PF-06700841 is a medicine that has shown potential in previous studies for the 
treatment of psoriasis. PF-06700841 stops the functioning of enzymes known as 
janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). These enzymes control signals 
to the immune system cells that produce proteins known as cytokines, which cause 
inflammation. This inflammation is used by the immune system to fight infections 
that may be caused by viruses or bacteria. In people with PsA, the body's immune 
system begins to attack healthy cells and tissue by causing inflammation. By stopping 
the function of JAK1 and TYK2, PF-06700841 may prevent the abnormal immune 
system response and inflammation in patients with PsA.
What was the purpose of this study? 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of PF-06700841 in 
participants with active (currently experiencing symptoms) PsA after 16 weeks of 
treatment in comparison with a placebo. After 16 weeks, the purpose of this study 
was to provide all participants with PF-06700841 to determine the safety and 
beneficial effect of this medicine after using it for 1 year. 
- PF-06700841 is a new investigational medicine. A new investigational 
medicine is one that is currently not approved in a country.
- A placebo looks like the study medicine but does not contain any medicine. 
Researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or is safer 
than not taking anything.

How was the study done? Researchers tested PF-06700841 on a group of study participants to find out if study participants with PsA taking PF-06700841 (the test medicine) had a higher ACR20 score than study participants with PsA taking placebo. A description of how the study was done can be seen in Figure 1 below. Researchers wanted to know: Did the participants taking PF-06700841 have better effectiveness in the treatment of PsA when compared to placebo? Researchers wanted to determine the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) score of participants taking PF-06700841 and compare it to the ACR20 score of participants taking placebo after 16 weeks of treatment. 
The ACR20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at least three of the following five factors: Inflammation in joints; Participants' treatment response and progress; Doctors’ observations of participants' treatment response and progress; Daily pain in joints; How much PsA interferes with the participants daily activities.
Whether PF-06700841 caused any medical problems in participants? Researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of PF-06700841. They monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study.
Figure 1. A description of how the study was done. The ACR20 was determined at 16 weeks. The study participants and researchers did not know who took PF-06700841 and who took the placebo. This is known as a “blinded” study. Study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. The study was only slightly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the study participants had already completed the treatment portion of the study. 
Where did this study take place? The Sponsor ran this study at 47 locations in 11 countries in Australia, Asia, and Europe. When did this study take place? It began 13 June 2019 and ended 15 January 2021. Who participated in this study? The study included participants who were between the ages of 18 and 75 years old, had symptoms of PsA for at least 6 months, and had active PsA despite taking anti-inflammatory medications for at least 4 weeks before the start of the study.
