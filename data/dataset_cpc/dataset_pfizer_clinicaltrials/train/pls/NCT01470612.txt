What is ulcerative colitis?
Ulcerative colitis ("UC") is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Patients with UC experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. Flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as a sense of urgency. Flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years.
There is no known cure for UC. Treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of UC and can even lead to long-term remission. However, there are few treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active UC. Medication is the most common treatment for UC.

What is tofacitinib?
Tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. It is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved and is available by prescription to treat adults with active, moderate to severe UC that did not respond well to other medications.

What was the purpose of this study?
Researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants with UC when taken over a long period of time.
