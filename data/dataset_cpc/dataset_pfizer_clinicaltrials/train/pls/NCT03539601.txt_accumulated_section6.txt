What is atopic dermatitis? 
Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing. The symptoms can look different on different people. Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. There is no known cure for this condition. People with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have "flare ups", when their symptoms worsen for a time.  
What is crisaborole? 
Crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. It is applied to the skin as an ointment twice a day. Crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin. Inflammation is the body's immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness.  
What was the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of the study was to see if the symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were reduced when crisaborole ointment was applied twice a day to the affected area compared to when a vehicle ointment was used. The vehicle ointment does not have any medicine in it, but it looks and feels just like the crisaborole ointment. Some participants in the study were given hydrocortisone butyrate cream (a topical corticosteroid) and others used pimecrolimus cream (a topical calcineurin inhibitor) rather than the crisaborole ointment or vehicle ointment. Topical means a treatment that is used on the skin. Corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor creams are commonly used to treat atopic dermatitis. The researchers also included treatment with these 2 creams in the study because they also wanted to see what happened when hydrocortisone butyrate cream and pimecrolimus cream were used instead of crisaborole or vehicle ointment.
