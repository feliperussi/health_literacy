Atopic dermatitis (or "AD"), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. AD occurs in 15%-30% of children in the United States. Some of the current medicines available for AD can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. Researchers are looking for new treatments for AD that can be taken for long periods of time. While researchers think that many things cause AD, it is made worse by the body's immune system (the body's defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). Cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called "cytokines". Researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with AD. The drug tested in this study was abrocitinib, which is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. Abrocitinib blocks the activity of a protein called "Janus kinase 1", or "JAK 1", which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. By turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, which may help AD improve. The researchers wanted to ask, 
- Are patients who are treated with medicated topical therapy more likely to have their AD improve when also taking abrocitinib compared to patients who are treated with a placebo? 
"Medicated topical therapy" was cream or ointment applied to the skin that contains medicine that is approved to treat AD. To see if the patients' AD got better during the study, the researchers used 2 standard methods to measure the severity of AD at the start of the study and throughout the 12 weeks of study treatment. The difference in severity was used to decide if a patient's AD had improved or not.

This study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients treated with 100 mg or 200 mg of abrocitinib once daily were more likely to have their AD improve compared to patients taking a placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. The study included adolescent boys and girls who were at least 12 years old and up to 18 years old. Patients included in the study:
-Had a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe AD when they entered the study.
-Also had one of the following: 
-Had been treated up to 6 months earlier for AD with medicines applied to the skin for at least 4 weeks, and their AD did not get better;
-Had needed to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their AD in the last 6 months (for example, taking medicines by mouth), or were eligible to take these medicines.
-Had used moisturizing products on their skin (such as skin cream) that did not contain medicine at least twice daily for the 7 days before starting the study treatments.
-Were willing to use standard skin treatments for AD during the study (called ‘topical background therapy’).
-Had not taken medications like abrocitinib before (known as systemic JAK inhibitors).
The patients and doctors did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the placebo. This is known as a “double-blinded” study. This is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either abrocitinib at a dose of 100 mg, abrocitinib at a dose of 200 mg, or placebo. This is known as a “randomized and placebo-controlled” study.
All of the patients in this study were treated with medicated topical therapy while taking abrocitinib or placebo.
The researchers in this study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients’ AD at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment. The first test is called the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scale and measures the severity of AD on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). The second test is called the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and measures how severe a patient’s AD is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by AD. The difference in each patient’s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their AD had improved.
While patients were only in the study for 12 to 16 weeks, the entire study took almost 14 months to complete. The Sponsor ran this study at 99 locations in 13 countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America. It began on 18 February 2019 and ended on 08 April 2020. A total of 145 boys and 140 girls participated. All patients were between the ages of 11 and 18. 
Patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 week treatment period. Of the 285 patients who started the study, 273 finished the study. Five (5) patients did not finish the study because of medical problems. Seven (7) patients left before the study was over by their choice or their parent’s choice, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.
