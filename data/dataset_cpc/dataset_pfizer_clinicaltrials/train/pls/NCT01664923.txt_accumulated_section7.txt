Prostate cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, walnut-sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men, and it is often a slow-growing cancer with few symptoms.
Enzalutamide is a prescription medicine that is approved to treat men with prostate cancer. Enzalutamide works by interfering with the connections between androgens (a type of hormone that plays a role in male traits and reproductive) and androgen receptors (a protein in the body that attaches to androgens). This may help to slow the growth of prostate cancer.
The main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer that did not sufficiently improve after receiving treatment to block androgens. Researchers wanted to answer this research question:
- How long did patients survive without prostate cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamide, compared to bicalutamide?
Bicalutamide is a medicine approved to treat men with prostate cancer.
This study compared two groups of patients to find out how long patients would survive without prostate cancer getting worse after receiving enzalutamide, compared to bicalutamide. The study included patients who had prostate cancer that did not sufficiently improve after receiving treatment to block androgens. These patients had either mild prostate cancer symptoms or no prostate cancer symptoms when the study began. Patients in this study were assigned to receive either enzalutamide or bicalutamide. The patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took bicalutamide. This is known as a "blinded" study. Patients were assigned to each treatment group by chance alone. This is known as a "randomized" study. Putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared.
