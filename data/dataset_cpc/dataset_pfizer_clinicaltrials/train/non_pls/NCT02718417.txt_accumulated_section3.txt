PFS2 was defined as time (in months) from the date of randomization to the start of second subsequent treatment after first documentation of PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression as per RECIST version 1.1, was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
In CP, based on investigator's decision, participants received either: paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, IV infusion, followed by carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion (carboplatin dose [milligrams](mg) = Target AUC [milligrams*minute per milliliter] (mg*min/mL) x GFR mL/min + 25), and maximum carboplatin dose = target AUC x (150 mL/min) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6; or Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV infusion over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15, along with carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1 to 6. Each cycle was of 21 days (3 weeks). After completion of CP, participants were followed for survival status until death or until study completion, whichever was earlier or a maximum duration of 24 months in observation phase. Participants were then followed up to a maximum of 36 months.
