This is a 12-month study investigating the effectiveness and safety of tofactinib in treating the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis and improving physical function and preserving bone structure in patients with an inadequate response to a traditional, nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Adalimumab is used as a comparator.
The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems [1], some or moderate problems [2], or extreme problems [3]) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state) visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual's rating for their current health-related quality of life state; higher scores indicate a better health state, with a higher value representing better health status.
PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity & percentage body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, & scaling, evaluated separately for head & neck, upper limbs, trunk, & lower limbs & rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis & is assigned a score: 0=no involvement; 1=0-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. In each area, sum of severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of numbers obtained for the 4 body areas is the PASI score & can vary in increments of 0.1 & range from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores represent greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI.
