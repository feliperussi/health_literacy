AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.
The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-3 (ESR) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed and ESR. DAS28-3 (ESR) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.70 ln(ESR [mm/first hour]*1.08+0.16. Total score range: 0-9.4. Higher score indicated more disease activity. The criterion of DAS28-3 LDAS was DAS28<3.2. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.

The SDAI is a continuous composite measure derived from components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Core Dataset.The SDAI was calculated using the following formula: SDAI = Tender / Painful Joint Count(TJC) (using 28 joints) + Swollen Joint Count (SJC) (using 28 joints) + Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis (PtGA) (0-10 cm scale) + Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis (PhGA) (0-10 cm scale) + high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (mg/dL). SDAI total score= 0-86. SDAI <=3.3 indicates disease remission, >3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, >11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and >26 = high disease activity. The primary analysis utilized a Bayesian ANCOVA model with an informative placebo prior distribution with borrowing from tofacitinib historical placebo data. The confidence interval was credible interval in this statistical analysis. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.

The EQ-5D-3L health state profile is a patient completed questionnaire designed to assess impact on health related quality of life in 5 domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, scores from the 5 domains might have been used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EQ-5D-3L have been established in a number of disease states, including RA. EQ-5D-3L scores marked health status from 0 and 100. There were notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponded to " the worst health you could imagine", and the highest rate (100) corresponded to "the best health you could imagine". Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.

The SF 36 version 2 (acute) is a 36 item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health domains. These domains can also be summarized as physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS). The PCS and MCS summary scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing better self-reported health. The lower the score the more disability. This was performed early in the clinic visit and before the participant had extensive contact with site personnel and/or Investigator. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
The TJC (28) included the following joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, metatarsophalangeal (MCP) joints, PIP joints, and knees. This count was calculated from the TJC (68) assessed. The SJC (28) included the same joints as TJC (28), and was calculated from the SJC 66 assessed for swelling.Sixty eight (68) joints were assessed by a blinded joint assessor to determine the number of joints that were considered tender or painful. The 68 joints assessed were: temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular; shoulder, elbow, wrist, MCPs, thumb interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeals, and distal interphalangeals; hip, knee, ankle, tarsus, metatarsophalangeals, great toe interphalangeal, proximal and distal interphalangeals combined. Sixty-six (66) joints were assessed for swelling, the same as those listed for TJC, excluding the right and left hip joints. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind, double dummy, placebo and active-controlled, parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF 06650833 at Week 12 in subjects with moderate-severe, active, RA who have had an inadequate response to MTX. PF-06650833 or matching placebo tablets will be administered orally QD under fasting conditions, and tofacitinib or matching tofacitinib placebo tablets will be administered orally BID for 12 weeks in a blinded fashion.
The HAQ-DI was defined as participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Tofacitinib was included in this study as an active control. The efficacy endpoint for the tofatinicib arm was an exploratory endpoint and neither primary nor secondary endpoints.
