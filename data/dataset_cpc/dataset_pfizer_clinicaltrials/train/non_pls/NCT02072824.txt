Participants aged >3 months to <4 years, received Pregabalin 3.5 mg/kg/day (3.0 mg/kg/day for participants 1 to 3 months of age), orally TID in equally divided doses for first 2 days and 7 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg/day for participants 1 to 3 months of age), orally TID in equally divided doses for next 3 days; followed by 14 mg/kg/day (12 mg/kg/day for participants 1 to 3 months of age), orally TID in equally divided doses for 9 days; and 7 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg/day for participants 1 to 3 months of age), orally TID in equally divided doses for next 4 days and 3.5 mg/kg/day (3.0 mg/kg/day for participants 1 to 3 months of age), orally TID in equally divided doses for next 3 days.
All partial onset seizures experienced during treatment phase were recorded by central reader during the 48 to 72 hour video-electroencephalogram (EEG). Double Blind 24 hour EEG seizure rate for all partial onset seizures = ([Number of seizures in double blind 48 to 72 hour EEG assessment] divided by [number of hours of video-EEG monitoring])*24. The EEG assessment was done at the end of the fixed dose treatment. For log-transformation, the quantity 1 was added to the double blind 24 hour EEG seizure rate for all participants to account for any possible "0" seizure incidence. This resulted in final calculation as: log transformed (double-blind 24-hour EEG seizure rate + 1).
Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were events which occurred between first dose of study drug and up to end of study (up to Day 25) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Relatedness to drug was assessed by the investigator. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.
This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 doses of pregabalin to reduce seizure frequency as an add on therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to <4 years of age with refractory partial onset seizures. It is hypothesized that both doses of pregabalin will demonstrate superior efficacy when compared to placebo by reducing the partial onset seizure frequency and that pregabalin will be safe and well tolerated.
Criteria for abnormalities in ECG findings: 1) Time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization (QRS complex): >=140 milliseconds (msec); 2) The interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization (PR interval): >=200 msec; 3) Time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTCF interval): absolute value 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; 4) Maximum QT interval: >=500 msec; 5) Maximum QTCB interval (Bazett's correction): 450 to< 480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec. Only those categories of ECG abnormalities in which participants were found abnormal (maximum QTCB interval 450-<480 msec), were reported in this outcome measure.
