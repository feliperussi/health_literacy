The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence from 6, 7, 8, 9 to 10 years post-administration of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine as compared to Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy subjects 11 to 55 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated.
Solicited local events:1)pain(Grade [G] : 0=none,1=mild,neither interfered nor prevented normal activities,2=moderate, painful when limb moved; interfered with normal activities,3=severe, significant pain at rest,prevented normal activities),2)redness, and 3)swelling (record greatest surface diameter in millimetre[mm] as 0 to less than or equal to[<=]20 mm, greater than[>]20 to <=50 mm,>50 mm). If to resolve any event medical advice taken, results reported as Medical Advice. Solicited general events: 1) fatigue, 2) gastrointestinal(GI) events(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain,3) headache(G : 0=normal, 1=mild, easily tolerated,2=moderate, interfered with normal activity,3=severe, prevented normal activity), and 4)fever (G: 0=less than[<] 37.5 degree Celsius[Â°C], 1= 37.5 degree C to 38.0degree C, 2= 38.1 degreeC to 39.0 degree C,3 =>39.0 degree C). 'Related'=relationship to study vaccine assessed by investigator.Medical advice=medical advice received to resolve any event.
Persistence phase was followed up by booster phase. Persistence phase: Participants received a single 0.5 mL dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine intramuscularly, as primary vaccination in study 107386 [NCT00356369]. Then, in this study (MENACWY-TT-99), they were evaluated for long-term persistence of immune response for 4 years (7, 8, 9 and 10 years post primary vaccination). Booster phase: All eligible participants from persistence phase who provided informed consent to enroll in booster phase, received a single 0.5 mL booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine intramuscularly in this study, 10 years post primary vaccination in 107386 [NCT00356369], and were followed up for 6 months after booster vaccination.
