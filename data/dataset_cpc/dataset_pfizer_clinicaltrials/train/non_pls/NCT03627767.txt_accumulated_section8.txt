4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin/genitals) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Overall % BSA for an individual % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.
Time (in days) to loss of response based on achieving IGA >=2 was measured from date of first dose of randomized treatment until last dose of randomized treatment (if not entered rescue) or first day of rescue treatment (if entered rescue) and based on EASI, loss of at least 50% of EASI response at Week 12 and IGA score of 2 or higher. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores=more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling with scores 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe. EASI quantifies severity of AD based on severity of lesion clinical signs and % of BSA affected. EASI composite score evaluates degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification.
PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [darker or lighter], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participants had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.
B7451014 is a Phase 3 study to investigate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and over with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects responding well to an initial open-label 12 week treatment of PF-04965842 (200 mg) taken orally once daily (QD) will be identified and randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 200 mg QD PF-04965842, 100 mg QD PF-04965842, or QD placebo. Efficacy and safety of 2 doses of PF-04965842 will be evaluated relative to placebo over 40 weeks. Subjects experiencing significant worsening of their symptoms, i.e., protocol-defined flare, enter 12 weeks rescue treatment and receive 200 mg PF-04965842 together with a marketed topical medicine. Eligible patients will have the option to enter a long-term extension study after completing the initial 12 week treatment, the 12 week rescue treatment, and the 40 week blinded treatment.
SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.
Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Over With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis With the Option of Rescue Treatment in Flaring Subjects
EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score = 0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll). Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
