Nausea/Vomiting:Mild:No interference with activity or 1-2 times in 24 hours;Moderate:Some interference with activity or>2 times in 24 hours;Severe:Prevented daily activity, required IV hydration.Diarrhea:Mild:2-3 loose stools in 24 hours;Moderate: 4-5 loose stools in 24 hours;Severe:>=6 loose stools in 24 hours.Headache:Mild:No interference with activity;Moderate:Repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever >24 hours or some interference with activity;Severe:Significant; any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevents daily activity.Fatigue:Mild:No interference with activity;Moderate: Some interference with activity;Severe: Significant; prevented daily activity.Muscle pain:Mild: No interference with activity;Moderate:Some interference with activity;Severe:Significant;prevented daily activity.Muscle/joint pain:Mild: No interference with activity;Moderate:Some interference with activity;Severe:Significant; prevented daily activity.Grade 4 for all AEs:Emergency visit or hospitalization.
A TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF A BOOSTER DOSE OF A GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS 6 VALENT POLYSACCHARIDE CONJUGATE VACCINE (GBS6) IN HEALTHY ADULTS
Local reactions were collected by using an e-diary and included pain at injection site, redness, and swelling graded below: pain at injection site: mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interfered with activity), severe (any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevented daily activity), grade 4 (emergency room visit or hospitalization). Redness and swelling were graded as: mild (2.0-5.0 centimeter [cm]), moderate (greater than [>] 5.0-10.0 cm),severe (>10.0 cm), grade 4 for redness (necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis) and grade 4 for swelling (necrosis).Maximum severity (highest grading) of each location reaction within 14 days of vaccination was derived.
This study is an extension to the completed first-in-human C1091001 study (NCT03170609) and is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single booster vaccine dose of GBS6, administered approximately 2 years or more after a primary GBS6 dose, to healthy adult males and nonpregnant women. The study will determine whether individuals who received a primary dose of GBS6 have additional benefit following a booster dose.
