BASMI assess axial status and spinal mobility. It composed of 5 clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component score mapped between 0 and 10, high score=more impairment of axial status, spinal mobility. For cervical rotation angle, participant sit straight on chair with chin level and hands on knees. Blinded assessor place goniometer at top of head in line with nose and ask participant to rotate neck maximally to left, follows with goniometer and record angle between sagittal plane and new plane after rotation. A second reading obtained and both readings recorded. Procedure repeated for right side. Better of two for each side was selected for scoring. Scoring done by calculating mean of left and right measurement and recorded in degrees (range: 0 to 90), higher cervical rotation value=better health status.
ASDAS(CRP) was derived using BASDAI (6-item questionnaire measures disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity) and PGA (measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity) and calculated by using the following formula, 0.121 x Back Pain (Q2 of BASDAI) + 0.058 x Duration of Morning Stiffness (Q6 of BASDAI) + 0.110 x PGA + 0.073 x Peripheral Pain/Swelling (Q3 of BASDAI) + 0.579 x Ln(high sensitivity [hs] CRP mg/Liter [L] + 1). If hsCRP values were smaller than 2 mg/L, they were set to 2 mg/L in the formula. The range of score was >= 0.636 to no defined upper limit. A negative change from baseline value indicates decrease in disease activity; a positive change from baseline value indicates increase in disease activity.
ASAS 5/6 consists of 6 domains: 4 used in ASAS20 - PGA (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], higher score=more disease activity), Spinal Pain (total back pain) (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], higher score=more severity), Function (using BASFI which assess participant's level of ability on a scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], lower scores= better functional health) and Inflammation (using BASDAI, mean of Q 5 and 6, which assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity), CRP (was measured in mg per liter) and Spinal mobility was measured in centimeter and calculated as mean of right and left measurements of lateral spinal flexion from BASMI. ASAS 5/6: defined as >=20% improvement in at least 5 domains.
ASAS20 assess 4 domains: Patient Global Assessment of Disease (PGA) (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity), total back pain (scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], high score=more severity), Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]; participant's level of ability on scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], low score= better functional health) and Inflammation (morning stiffness, Mean of Question [Q]5 and Q6 of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI] defined as 6-item questionnaire measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], high score=more disease activity). ASAS20 response: greater than or equal to (>=) 20 percent (%) improvement from baseline in disease activity and absolute change of >=1 unit in >=3 domains and no worsening of >=20% and an absolute change of >=1 unit in remaining domain.
