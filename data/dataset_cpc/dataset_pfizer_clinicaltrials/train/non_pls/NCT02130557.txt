An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity grading based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1 =mild; Grade 2 =moderate; Grade 3 =severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; Grade 4 =life-threatening or disabling, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 =death. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 60 months that were absent before treatment that worsened relative to pretreatment state. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than 1 adverse event, only the maximum CTCAE was reported.
Criteria for ECG abnormalities included heart rate: increase of >15 bpm from baseline value and >=120 bpm, decrease of >15 bpm from baseline value and <=45 bpm; PR interval: change of >=20 msec from baseline value and >=220 milliseconds (msec); QRS interval >=120 msec; QTcB interval >500 msec, increase of >60 msec from baseline; >450 msec (Men) or >470 msec (Women). QT interval using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) >500 msec, increase of >60 msec from baseline, >450 msec (Men) or >470 msec (Women). The number of participants with ECG abnormalities during On-treatment period are reported. On-Treatment was defined as values collected after the date of the first dose of test article up until the last date of test article +28 days.
The Kaplan-Meier curve was generated based on the first date of MMR until the date of the confirmed loss of MMR or censoring, objectively documented, for responders only. Confirmed loss of MMR was BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio >0.1% in association with a >=5-fold increase in BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio from the lowest value achieved up to that time-point confirmed by a second assessment at least 28 days later. Treatment discontinuation due to suboptimal response/treatment failure, progressive disease (PD) or death due to PD within 28 days of last dose were considered confirmed loss of MMR. PD was defined as disease progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML.
EFS was defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause, transformation to AP or BP at any time, confirmed loss of complete hematologic response (CHR), confirmed loss of CCyR or censoring. Loss of CHR was defined as a hematologic assessment of non-CHR (chronic phase, AP, or BP) confirmed by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Loss of CHR was defined as appearance of any of the following: WBC count that rises to >20.0*10^9/L, platelet count rises to >=600*10^9/L, appearance of palpable spleen or other extramedullary involvement proven by biopsy, appearance of 5% myelocytes in peripheral blood, appearance of blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood. Loss of CCyR was defined as at least 1 Ph+ metaphase from analysis of <100 metaphases confirmed by follow up cytogenetic analysis after 1 month. Cumulative incidence of EFS was defined as percentage of participants with EFS event at Month 60 and was adjusted for competing risk of treatment discontinuation without event.
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to maximum severity grading based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; within normal limits, Grade 3= severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5= death. Trough plasma concentration of participants who had grade 1 or higher AE are presented in this outcome measure. Data of plasma concentration is reported separately for each preferred term of AE.
A Multicenter Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Bosutinib Versus Imatinib in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
Phase 3, 2-arm, randomized, open label trial. Patients will be randomized to receive bosutinib or imatinib for the duration of the study.
