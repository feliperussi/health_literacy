The purpose of this open-label, 2:1 randomized phase III trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) versus protocol-specific physician's choice in patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations.
Toxicity grades were evaluated based on as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). NCI CTCAE v4.03 defined the severity grade as: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (potentially life threatening) and grade 5 (death related to AE) for each parameter. Key hematology parameters included hemoglobin (gram per liter [g/L]), leukocytes (10^6 cells per liter), lymphocytes (10^6 cells per liter), neutrophils (10^6 cells per liter), and platelets (10^9 cells per liter). Low value indicated lower values than the baseline values and high value indicated higher values than the baseline values. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
Participants received 1 of the following drugs in specified regimens, as per the physician's choice: 1) capecitabine 1250 mg/m^2 orally twice daily on Day 1 to 14 in each cycle; 2) eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m^2 (equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/ m^2), as 2 to 5 minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 3) gemcitabine 1250 mg/m^2 as 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 4) vinorelbine 30 mg/m^2 as 6 to 10 minute IV infusion on Day 1, 8, and 15 in each cycle; until radiographic disease progression as determined by the central IRF, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician's decision to terminate treatment, or Sponsor's decision to terminate the trial (up to a maximum of 45.3 months). One cycle was of 21 days.
IRF assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented radiologic progressive disease per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, progression defined as 1) for target lesions: at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), the absolute increase in the sum has to be at least 5 millimeter (mm); 2) for non-target lesions: unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions; 3) and/or appearance of one or more new lesions. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.
