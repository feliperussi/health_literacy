EASI evaluates severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions(head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in each 4 body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
IGA assesses severity of participant's AD on a 5 point scale. 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting and 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. Higher scores indicating more severity of AD. Assessment excluded soles, palms and scalp.
Dose Ranging Study to Assess Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of PF-06700841 Topical Cream in Participants With Mild or Moderate Atopic Dermatitis
4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.
Local tolerability skin assessments were performed by the investigator and graded based on severity from grade 0 to 4 as: grade 0=none (no evidence of local intolerance); grade 1=mild (minimal erythema and/or oedema, slight glazed appearance); grade 2= moderate (definite erythema and/or oedema with peeling and/or cracking but needs no adaptation of posology) grade 3=severe (erythema, oedema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules consider removing topical agent [if still in place]) and grade 4= very severe (strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions: removal of topical agent [if still in place]). Higher grades indicated worsening of condition. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
