The purpose of this open-label, 2:1 randomized phase III trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) versus protocol-specific physician's choice in patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations.
Toxicity grades were evaluated based on as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03). NCI CTCAE v4.03 defined the severity grade as: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (potentially life threatening) and grade 5 (death related to AE) for each parameter. Key hematology parameters included hemoglobin (gram per liter [g/L]), leukocytes (10^6 cells per liter), lymphocytes (10^6 cells per liter), neutrophils (10^6 cells per liter), and platelets (10^9 cells per liter). Low value indicated lower values than the baseline values and high value indicated higher values than the baseline values. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.
Participants received 1 of the following drugs in specified regimens, as per the physician's choice: 1) capecitabine 1250 mg/m^2 orally twice daily on Day 1 to 14 in each cycle; 2) eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m^2 (equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/ m^2), as 2 to 5 minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 3) gemcitabine 1250 mg/m^2 as 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 4) vinorelbine 30 mg/m^2 as 6 to 10 minute IV infusion on Day 1, 8, and 15 in each cycle; until radiographic disease progression as determined by the central IRF, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician's decision to terminate treatment, or Sponsor's decision to terminate the trial (up to a maximum of 45.3 months). One cycle was of 21 days.
IRF assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented radiologic progressive disease per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, progression defined as 1) for target lesions: at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), the absolute increase in the sum has to be at least 5 millimeter (mm); 2) for non-target lesions: unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions; 3) and/or appearance of one or more new lesions. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.
TTD was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the first observation with a>=10 point increase and no subsequent observations with a <10 point increase from baseline in breast symptom score based on the EORTC-QLQ-BR23. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer. EORTC-QLQ-BR23 symptoms subscale includes 4 items: systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss. Each item is rated by choosing 1 of 4 possible responses that record the level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, and 4= very much), higher scores=high level of symptom/problems.
An adverse events (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a participant administered study drug or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug or the day before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy or 30 days after the date of the last dose date of study drug, whichever occurred first, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and all non-SAEs.
Criteria for potentially clinically significant changes in vital signs included a) Systolic blood pressure: 1) absolute results (AB) greater than (>) 180 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) and increase from baseline (IFB) greater than or equal to (>=) 40 mmHg, 2) absolute results less than (<) 90 mmHg and decrease from baseline (DFB) >30 mmHg; b) Diastolic blood pressure: 1) absolute results >110 mmHg and >=30 mmHg increase from baseline, 2) absolute results <50 mmHg and >20 mmHg decrease from baseline 3) >=20 mmHg increase from baseline; c) Heart rate: 1) absolute results>120 beats per minute [bpm] and >30 bpm increase from baseline, 2) absolute results <50 bpm and >20 bpm decrease from baseline and d) Weight: >10 percent [%] decrease from baseline.
