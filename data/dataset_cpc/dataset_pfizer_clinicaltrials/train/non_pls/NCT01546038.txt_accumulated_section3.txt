OS was defined as duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS. In this method, every participant had a follow-up time which was associated with an indicator, 1=event (death in our case), and 0 =censored. If the participants were not known to have died, time to date of last known to be alive was used as to calculate the follow-up time and indicator was 0 for these participants. KM method estimates the median OS based on the K-M curve. The K-M curve only drops when we had an event and censor data are the ticks in the graph. To estimate median OS, the K-M curve usually will be smoothed first and a line will be drawn at 50%. The median OS is the point when K-M curve and the horizontal hit. Survival status was collected every month for the first 2 months after discontinuation of study treatment and thereafter every 2 months until death or 4 years from each participant's first dose.
A DLT was any of the following adverse events (AEs) in Cycle 1 and considered by the investigator possibly related to glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy: (1) Grade >= 3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding Grade >= 3 infection, fever (including febrile neutropenia), infusion related AEs, electrolyte abnormalities and ALT/AST elevation that returned to Grade <= 1 or baseline within 7 days; (2) prolonged myelosuppression that lasted longer than 42 days from the point of detection, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/microliter(mcL) or platelet count < 10 *10^9/L with a normal bone marrow (<5% blasts and no evidence of disease or dysplasia); (3) inability to deliver at least 80% of the planned study doses for all agents in a combination due to non-hematologic toxicities; (4) Delay of >28 days in receiving the next scheduled cycle due to persisting non-hematologic toxicities. Arm A: Glasdegib+LDAC; Arm B: Glasdegib+Decitabine; Arm C: Glasdegib+Cytarabine/Daunorubicin.
Participants received 1-2 cycles of induction (glasdegib and daunorubicin/cytarabine), followed by 2-4 cycles of consolidation (glasdegib and high dose cytarabine) and a maximum of 6 cycles of maintenance (glasdegib alone). Daunorubicin was given on Days 1-3 QD at a dose of 60 mg/m^2/day by IV together with cytarabine on Days 1-7 at a dose of 100 mg/m^2/day by continuous IV infusion for each cycle of induction. Cytarabine was given on Days 1, 3, and 5 at a dose of 1 g/m^2 administered as a 3-hour IV infusion every 12 hours (2 g/m^2/day) for each cycle of consolidation. Glasdegib tablets 100 mg QD was started on induction Cycle 1/Day -3 and administered continuously QD thereafter for the duration of the study. A cycle was defined as 28 days.
