This is a single-arm, open-label, extended treatment, safety study in patients treated with talazoparib in qualifying studies.
The following liver parameters were analyzed: aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBL) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The criteria for clinically significant abnormalities for liver parameters included AST or ALT greater than or equal to (>=) 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT or AST greater than (>) 5 times ULN; ALT or AST > 10 times ULN; ALT or AST > 20 times ULN; total TBL >2 times ULN; ALT or AST >= 3 times ULN and TBL > 2 times ULN and ALT or AST >= 3 times ULN and TBL > 2 times ULN and ALP < 2 times ULN.
Criteria for clinically significant changes in vital signs included a) Systolic blood pressure (SBP): 1) absolute results >180 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) and increase from baseline >=40 mmHg, 2) absolute results <90 mmHg and decrease from baseline >30 mmHg; b) Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 1) absolute results >110 mmHg and increase from baseline >=30 mmHg , 2) absolute results <50 mmHg and decrease from baseline >20 mmHg , 3) increase from baseline >=20 mmHg; c) Heart rate: 1) absolute results >120 beats per minute (bpm) and increase from baseline >30 bpm, 2) absolute results <50 bpm and >20 bpm decrease from baseline; d) Temperature: <=34.5 or >=38 degree Celsius. Criteria for clinically significant changes in weight: >10 percent (%) decrease from baseline.
Open-Label Extension and Safety Study of Talazoparib
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug without regard to possibility of a causal relationship. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; was life-threatening (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was considered as an important medical event. TEAEs were AEs that occurred on or after the administration of first dose of study drug through approximately 30 days after the last dose. AE included both SAEs and all non-SAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs were defined as any TEAE with at least a possible relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator or that was missing the assessment of causal relationship whose relationship to the study drug could not be ruled out.
