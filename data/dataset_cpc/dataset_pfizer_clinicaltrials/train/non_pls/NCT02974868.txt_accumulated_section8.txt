SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 75 response is a 75% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 50 response is a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo.

SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100% with higher score indicates more severe disease. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dosing (Day 1). Percent change from baseline is defined as SALT baseline value minus SALT value at a specific visit divided by baseline and multiplying by 100. Positive change from baseline implies an improvement. Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval of Arms (PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) are the Least Square Mean and 90% Confidence Interval for difference from placebo respectively.
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 90 response is a 90% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data.
