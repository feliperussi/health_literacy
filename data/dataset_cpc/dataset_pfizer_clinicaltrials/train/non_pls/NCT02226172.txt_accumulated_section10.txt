A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized 2:1 to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib.

Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Week 131) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse event.
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Week 131) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

SAE was AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AE were assessed according to maximum severity grading based on NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.Grade 1=mild; Grade 2=moderate; within normal limits. Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4=life-threatening or disabling; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5=death.

Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a ≥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was <100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of ≥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of <85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of ≥85 g/L.
