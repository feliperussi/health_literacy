Pre-treatment ABR = number of bleeding episodes within 6 months prior to study enrollment (total number of bleeding episodes in hemophilia history CRF) Ã— 2; On-study ABR = number of bleeding episodes occurred within 9 days after the last dose / ([last dose date + 9 - first dose date + 1] / 365.25) The historical On Demand group was constructed using the following internal Pfizer studies: ReFacto AF 3082B2-4432 (B1831004), BeneFIX B1821010, and BeneFIX 3090A1-400 (B1821004). Participants who were on On Demand treatment in B1831004, as well as data from the On Demand period in B1821004 and B1821010 were used to construct the historical On Demand group. The resulting dataset were further filtered to match the key inclusion/exclusion criteria of Study B7841002 based on age and factor activity (18 <=age <=65 and factor activity <=1%).
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous and/or intravenous doses of PF-06741086 in subjects with severe hemophilia.
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.
