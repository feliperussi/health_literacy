Bone lesion responded: if its change from baseline in SUVtotal is below limit of agreement (LOA, no specific value, based upon test/retest analysis using software). SUVtotal: total NaF uptake,indicated tumor burden across all bone lesions/in individual lesions reflecting bone-metastatic prostate cancer.NaF-3 performed on any of these: 1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression(increase of >=25% and absolute increase of >=2.0 ng/mL above nadir); 2) bone progressive disease(PD)(appearance of >=2 new lesions after screening assessed by technetium Tc 99m medronate [99mTc-MDP] bone scintigraphy); 3) soft tissue PD; 4) clinically relevant progression by investigator; 5) at 2 years without progression after treatment initiation. PD, RECIST1.1:>=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,(reference smallest sum on study, included baseline sum if that is smallest on study),relative increase of 20%,sum of diameters indicated absolute increase of >=5mm, appearance of >=1 new lesions.
Global SUVhetero score:Sum of(SUVmean of each lesion minus global SUVmean of all lesion)^2/number of lesions,measure of heterogeneity of tumor activity across all bone lesions.SUVmean(mean NaF uptake)indicated average activity of each lesions.Real limits for SUVhetero score ranged:0(minimum) to infinite(maximum).Higher global SUVhetero score:more heterogeneity in bone lesion activity.NaF-3 performed on any of these 1)PSA progression(increase of>=25% and absolute increase of>=2.0ng/mL above nadir);2)bone PD(appearance of>=2 new lesions after screening assessed by 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy);3)soft tissue PD(RECIST1.1);4)clinically relevant progression by investigator;5)at 2years without progression after treatment initiation.PD perRECIST1.1:>=20%increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,(reference smallest sum on study,this included baseline sum if that is smallest on study),relative increase of20%,sum of diameters indicated absolute increase of>=5mm,appearance of>=1 new lesions.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission tomography / computed tomography (18F-NaF PET/CT) imaging as a method for determining treatment response in metastatic bone lesions in patients who are receiving enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
