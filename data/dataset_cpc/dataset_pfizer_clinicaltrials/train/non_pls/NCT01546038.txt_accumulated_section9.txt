OS was defined as duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS. In this method, every participant had a follow-up time which was associated with an indicator, 1=event (death in our case), and 0 =censored. If the participants were not known to have died, time to date of last known to be alive was used as to calculate the follow-up time and indicator was 0 for these participants. KM method estimates the median OS based on the K-M curve. The K-M curve only drops when we had an event and censor data are the ticks in the graph. To estimate median OS, the K-M curve usually will be smoothed first and a line will be drawn at 50%. The median OS is the point when K-M curve and the horizontal hit. Survival status was collected every month for the first 2 months after discontinuation of study treatment and thereafter every 2 months until death or 4 years from each participant's first dose.
A DLT was any of the following adverse events (AEs) in Cycle 1 and considered by the investigator possibly related to glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy: (1) Grade >= 3 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding Grade >= 3 infection, fever (including febrile neutropenia), infusion related AEs, electrolyte abnormalities and ALT/AST elevation that returned to Grade <= 1 or baseline within 7 days; (2) prolonged myelosuppression that lasted longer than 42 days from the point of detection, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/microliter(mcL) or platelet count < 10 *10^9/L with a normal bone marrow (<5% blasts and no evidence of disease or dysplasia); (3) inability to deliver at least 80% of the planned study doses for all agents in a combination due to non-hematologic toxicities; (4) Delay of >28 days in receiving the next scheduled cycle due to persisting non-hematologic toxicities. Arm A: Glasdegib+LDAC; Arm B: Glasdegib+Decitabine; Arm C: Glasdegib+Cytarabine/Daunorubicin.
Participants received 1-2 cycles of induction (glasdegib and daunorubicin/cytarabine), followed by 2-4 cycles of consolidation (glasdegib and high dose cytarabine) and a maximum of 6 cycles of maintenance (glasdegib alone). Daunorubicin was given on Days 1-3 QD at a dose of 60 mg/m^2/day by IV together with cytarabine on Days 1-7 at a dose of 100 mg/m^2/day by continuous IV infusion for each cycle of induction. Cytarabine was given on Days 1, 3, and 5 at a dose of 1 g/m^2 administered as a 3-hour IV infusion every 12 hours (2 g/m^2/day) for each cycle of consolidation. Glasdegib tablets 100 mg QD was started on induction Cycle 1/Day -3 and administered continuously QD thereafter for the duration of the study. A cycle was defined as 28 days.
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication and occurred within 28 days post last dose. An serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death; was life threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
For all MDS participants, disease specific efficacy measures included: CRi (bone marrow showing <5% myeloblasts with platelets <100,000/mcL or neutrophils <1000/mcL, including confirmed and unconfirmed responses); PR (repeat bone marrow myeloblasts showing decreased by >= 50% decrease but still >5%, peripheral blood showing neutrophils >= 1,000/mcL, platelets >= 100,000/mcL and Hgb>=11g/dL; including confirmed and unconfirmed responses); SD (including confirmed and unconfirmed responses, failure to achieve PR and no evidence of progression for >8 weeks); marrow complete response (mCR) (bone marrow showing <=5% myeloblasts and decreased by >= 50%), partial cytogenetic response (>=50% reduction of chromosomal abnormality) and complete cytogenetic response (CRc) (disappearance of chromosomal abnormality with no appearance of now ones).
This is a study to evaluate PF-04449913 (an inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome in combination with standard agents used to treat these diseases.
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication and occurred within 28 days post last dose. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.
Maximum absolute values and increases from baseline were summarized for QTcF interval (time from the beginning of Q wave to the end of T wave corresponding to electrical systole corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula). Number of participants with QTcF meeting the following criteria is presented:QTcF interval:<450 msec; QTcF interval: 450 to <480 msec; QTcF interval: 480 to <500 msec; QTcF interval >=500 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline: <30 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline: 30 to <60 msec; QTcF interval increase from baseline >=60 msec. End of treatment in the time frame were defined as: maximum of 12 cycles from start of therapy or until disease progression or relapse, participant refusal or unacceptable toxicity occurred, whichever came first.
