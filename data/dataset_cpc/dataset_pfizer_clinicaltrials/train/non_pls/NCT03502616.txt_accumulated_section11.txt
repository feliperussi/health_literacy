BASMI assess axial status and spinal mobility. It composed of 5 clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component score mapped between 0 and 10, high score=more impairment of axial status, spinal mobility. For cervical rotation angle, participant sit straight on chair with chin level and hands on knees. Blinded assessor place goniometer at top of head in line with nose and ask participant to rotate neck maximally to left, follows with goniometer and record angle between sagittal plane and new plane after rotation. A second reading obtained and both readings recorded. Procedure repeated for right side. Better of two for each side was selected for scoring. Scoring done by calculating mean of left and right measurement and recorded in degrees (range: 0 to 90), higher cervical rotation value=better health status.
ASDAS(CRP) was derived using BASDAI (6-item questionnaire measures disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity) and PGA (measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity) and calculated by using the following formula, 0.121 x Back Pain (Q2 of BASDAI) + 0.058 x Duration of Morning Stiffness (Q6 of BASDAI) + 0.110 x PGA + 0.073 x Peripheral Pain/Swelling (Q3 of BASDAI) + 0.579 x Ln(high sensitivity [hs] CRP mg/Liter [L] + 1). If hsCRP values were smaller than 2 mg/L, they were set to 2 mg/L in the formula. The range of score was >= 0.636 to no defined upper limit. A negative change from baseline value indicates decrease in disease activity; a positive change from baseline value indicates increase in disease activity.
ASAS 5/6 consists of 6 domains: 4 used in ASAS20 - PGA (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], higher score=more disease activity), Spinal Pain (total back pain) (on a scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], higher score=more severity), Function (using BASFI which assess participant's level of ability on a scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], lower scores= better functional health) and Inflammation (using BASDAI, mean of Q 5 and 6, which assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity), CRP (was measured in mg per liter) and Spinal mobility was measured in centimeter and calculated as mean of right and left measurements of lateral spinal flexion from BASMI. ASAS 5/6: defined as >=20% improvement in at least 5 domains.
ASAS20 assess 4 domains: Patient Global Assessment of Disease (PGA) (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity), total back pain (scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], high score=more severity), Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]; participant's level of ability on scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], low score= better functional health) and Inflammation (morning stiffness, Mean of Question [Q]5 and Q6 of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI] defined as 6-item questionnaire measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], high score=more disease activity). ASAS20 response: greater than or equal to (>=) 20 percent (%) improvement from baseline in disease activity and absolute change of >=1 unit in >=3 domains and no worsening of >=20% and an absolute change of >=1 unit in remaining domain.
Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib in Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire (felt fatigued, felt weak all over, felt listless ["washed out"],felt tired, had energy, had trouble starting things as tired, had trouble finishing things as tired, was able to do usual activities, needed to sleep during day, too tired to eat, needed help doing my usual activities, frustrated by being too tired to do things wanted to do, had to limit my social activity because tired), with each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Three type of scores were derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score was calculated by summing the 13 items (range 0 [not at all] to 52 [very much]); higher scores represent less fatigue status. In this outcome measure, change from baseline in FACIT-F total score was reported.
SF-36 v.2 (Acute): 36-item generic health status measure. It measured 8 general health domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, mental health. These domains were aggregated into 2 summary scores - physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS). Four domains comprised PCS score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health) and remaining 4 domains comprised MCS score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). Normalized domain scores, PCS, MCS scores are used in analyses. Component and domain scores were scored by using United States 1998 general population norm. Resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 and SF36 health domain scale and component summary measures had means of 50 and standard deviations of 10. Higher PCS/MCS/domain score represent better health status.
BASDAI was a validated questionnaire that consisted of 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS: fatigue; spinal pain; peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. Each question was rated using a numerical rating scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe), higher score=high disease activity. BASDAI score was calculated by computing mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it to sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then divided by 5. The total BASDAI score was ranged from 0= none to 10= very severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity. BASDAI50 response was defined as decrease of >=50% from Baseline in BASDAI score at specified time points. Percentage of participants with BASDAI 50 response at specified weeks are reported.
The purpose of this study is to determine if tofacitinib is safe and effective in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis.
ASAS20 assess 4 domains: PGA of Disease (assess disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity), total back pain (scale of 0 [no pain] to 10 [most severe pain], high score=more severity), Function (BASFI; participant's level of ability on scale of 0 [easy] to 10 [impossible], low score= better functional health) and Inflammation (morning stiffness, Mean of Q5 and Q6 of BASDAI defined as 6-item questionnaire measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], high score=more disease activity). ASAS20 response: >= 20% improvement from baseline in disease activity and absolute change of >=1 unit in >=3 domains and no worsening of >=20% and an absolute change of >=1 unit in remaining domain.
The WPAI assesses work productivity and impairment. It is a 6-item questionnaire used to assess the degree to which Ankylosing Spondylitis affected work productivity and regular activities over the past 7 days. The questions are as follows: Q1 = currently employed; Q2 = hours missed due to health problems; Q3 = hours missed due to other reasons; Q4 = hours actually worked; Q5 = degree health affected productivity while working (0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating less productivity); Q6 = degree health affected regular activities (0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment of regular activities). Percent work time missed due to health problem was a subscale and calculated as: Q2/(Q2+Q4) for those who were currently employed. Subscale score was expressed as an impairment percentage (range: 0-100%) where higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.
