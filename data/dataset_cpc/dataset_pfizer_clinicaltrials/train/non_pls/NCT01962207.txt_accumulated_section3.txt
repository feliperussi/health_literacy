Solicited general events: fatigue, gastrointestinal (GI) events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain, headache (0= normal, 1=mild/easily tolerated, 2=moderate/interfered with normal activity, 3=severe/prevented normal activity) and fever (>=37.5°C for oral/axillary/tympanic route, >=38.0°C for rectal route). Solicited local events: pain (0=none, 1=mild, not interfered/prevented normal activity, 2=moderate, painful when limb moved/interfered with normal activity, 3=severe, significant pain at rest/prevented normal activity), redness and swelling at injection site (record greatest surface diameter in millimeter (mm) as 0 to <=20 mm, >20 to <=50 mm, >50 mm). Participants may be represented in more than 1 category. Only categories with at least 1 participant reported. 'Medical advice' signifies medical advice received to resolve any event. 'Related'=relationship to study vaccine assessed by investigator.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after receiving a primary vaccination of meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT versus Meningitec™ or Mencevax™ ACWY, and the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT administered 10 years after the primary vaccination. All subjects received a primary vaccination at 1 to 10 years of age in study 108658 (NCT00427908). No new subjects will be enrolled in this booster study.
Persistence phase was followed up by booster phase. Persistence phase: Participants with <2 years of age, received a single 0.5 milliliter (mL) dose of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W 135, Y tetanus toxoid conjugate (MenACWY-TT) vaccine intramuscularly, as primary vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-027. Then, in this study (MENACWY-TT-100), they were evaluated for long-term persistence (of immune response and safety) for 5 years (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years post primary vaccination). Booster phase: Participants who provided consent, received a single 0.5 mL booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine intramuscularly in this study, 10 years post primary vaccination in MENACWY-TT-027, and were followed up for 6 months after booster vaccination.
