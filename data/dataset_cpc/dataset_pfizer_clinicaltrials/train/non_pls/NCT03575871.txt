B7451013 is a Phase 3 study to evaluate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and older with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy and safety of two dosage strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily, will be evaluated relative to placebo over 12 weeks of study participation. Eligible patients will have an option to enter a long-term extension study after completing 12 weeks of treatment.
EASI evaluates severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis
IGA assesses severity of AD on a 5 point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicate more severity). Scores: 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting; 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. Assessment excluded soles, palms and scalp.
PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.
EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.

Assessment excluded sole, palms and scalp.
SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where "0" = no itch or no sleeplessness and "10" = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.

Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.
