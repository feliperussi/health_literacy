Systemic events included following events: Fever was graded as mild (38.0 to 38.4 degree C), moderate (38.5 to 38.9 degree C), severe (39.0 to 40.0 degree C), grade (G) 4 (>40.0 degree C). Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (>2 times in 24 hours), severe (required intravenous hydration)/grade 4 (hospitalization for hypotensive shock). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours), severe (>=6 stools in 24 hours) and G4 (hospitalization). Headache, fatigue, new/worsening muscle pain and new/worsening joint pain was graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity), severe (prevents daily activity) and G4 (hospitalization). Any systemic event referred to any fever >= 38.0 degree C, any vomiting, any diarrhea, any headache, any fatigue, any new/worsening muscle pain, or any new or worsening joint pain.
A Study To Investigate Two 3-dose Schedules Of A Clostridium Difficile Vaccine In Healthy Adults Aged 65 to 85 Years
Systemic events included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, new or worsening muscle pain, new or worsening joint pain and were recorded by using an e-diary. Fever was graded as mild (38.0 to 38.4 C), moderate (38.5 to 38.9 degree C), severe (39.0 to 40.0 degree C), grade 4 (>40.0 degree C). Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (>2 times in 24 hours), severe (required intravenous hydration) and grade 4 (hospitalization for hypotensive shock). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours), severe (>=6 stools in 24 hours) and grade 4 (hospitalization). Headache, fatigue, new or worsening muscle pain and new or worsening joint pain was graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity), severe (prevents daily activity) and grade 4 (hospitalization).

This study will investigate a Clostridium difficile vaccine in healthy adults aged 65-85 years. Each subject will initially receive 3 doses of vaccine on 1 of 2 vaccination schedules. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of the vaccine as well as the subjects' immune response to the vaccine. One year after the third dose subjects that did not receive placebo will be randomized to receive a fourth dose. Subjects will be followed for up to 4 years after their third vaccination.
