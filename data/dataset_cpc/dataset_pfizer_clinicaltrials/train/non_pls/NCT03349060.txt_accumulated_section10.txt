PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.
IGA assesses severity of AD on a 5 point scale (0 to 4, higher scores indicate more severity). Scores: 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting; 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. Assessment excluded sole, palms and scalp.
EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin)] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.

SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). The severity scores added to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where "0" = no itch or no sleeplessness and "10" = the worst imaginable itch or sleeplessness, higher scores worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD = worse outcome.
HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.
FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants (aged above 17 years) scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated) greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (the best score) where higher scores indicated better overall health status (less fatigue).
HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D), both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.

The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where "0" = no itch/no sleeplessness and "10" = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.
Peds-FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire for adolescents of 12-17 years of age. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Higher the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the Peds-FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (the best score) where higher scores indicated better overall health status (less fatigue).
