DR: time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If no progression or death on study was observed, or given antitumor treatment other than study drug, participants were censored on date of last on-study tumor assessment. RECIST v1.1, a) PD: >=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of >=5 mm, appearance of 1 or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; b) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis); c) PR: >=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters.
PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to first documentation of objective PD or to death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If no progression or death on study was observed, or given antitumor treatment other than study drug, participants were censored on date of last on-study tumor assessment. RECIST v1.1, PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
