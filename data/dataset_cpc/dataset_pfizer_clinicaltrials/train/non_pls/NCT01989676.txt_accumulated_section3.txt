Participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer received PF-05280014 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle followed by paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle both as intravenous (IV) infusions until the end of the study. The first infusion of PF-05280014 was 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1. Subsequent weekly infusions of PF-05280014 were 2 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 over 60 minutes. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the PF-05280014 could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability.
A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or HerceptinÂ® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02)
One-year PFS rate was analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy) with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. The 95% CI for the median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.
