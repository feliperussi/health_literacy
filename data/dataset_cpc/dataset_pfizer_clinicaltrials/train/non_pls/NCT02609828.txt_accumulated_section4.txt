Weekly average pain intensity in the non-index cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. Non-index cancer pan sites were the most painful cancer pain sites other than the index bone metastasis cancer pain site. The participants described their weekly pain at the painful site by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline weekly average pain intensity was weekly average pain intensity NRS score recorded on any day during the baseline assessment period. Five days prior to dosing was considered as baseline assessment period. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weekly average pain intensity value was the weekly average pain intensity NRS scores recorded on any day from the span of 7 days prior to specified week.
Laboratory abnormality criteria included: hemoglobin (HGB); hematocrit; erythrocytes < 0.8*lower limit of normal (LLN); erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume/HGB/ HGB concentration, erythrocytes distribution width <0.9*LLN, >1.1*upper limit of normal (ULN); platelets <0.5*LLN,>1.75* ULN; leukocytes<0.6*LLN, >1.5*ULN; lymphocytes, neutrophils <0.8*LLN, >1.2*ULN; basophils, eosinophils, monocytes >1.2*ULN; total bilirubin>1.5*ULN; activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, prothrombin intl. normalized ratio >1.1*ULN; bilirubin >1.5*ULN; aspartate aminotransferase (AT), alanine AT, gamma glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase >3.0*ULN; protein; albumin<0.8*LLN, >1.2*ULN; urea nitrogen, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides >1.3*ULN; urate >1.2*ULN; sodium <0.95*LLN,>1.05*ULN; potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate <0.9*LLN, >1.1*ULN; phosphate <0.8*LLN, >1.2*ULN; Urine: glucose, ketones, protein, HGB, bilirubin, nitrite >=1.
Participants at specified time points, answered to the following question, "Considering all the ways your cancer pain affects you, how are you doing today?" on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, on IRT diaries. Scores:1= very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities); 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities); 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities); and 5= very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores signified worsening of condition.
Weekly worst pain intensity in the non-index cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), higher scores signified more severity of pain. Non-index cancer pan sites were the most painful cancer pain sites other than the index bone metastasis cancer pain site. The participants describe their weekly worst pain at the painful site by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline weekly worst pain intensity was weekly worst pain intensity NRS score recorded on any day during the baseline assessment period. Five days prior to dosing was considered as baseline assessment period. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weekly worst pain intensity value was the weekly worst pain intensity NRS scores which was recorded on any day from the span of 7 days prior to specified week.
