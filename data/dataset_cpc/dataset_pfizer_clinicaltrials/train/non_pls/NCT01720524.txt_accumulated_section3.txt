Audiological evaluations of participants were recorded and reported by air conduction via phones/headphones through pure tone audiometry test which included participants with hearing loss ranged from less than or equal to (<=) 20 decibel hearing loss (DB HL), 21-40 DB HL, 41-70 DB HL, 71-90 DB HL, greater than (>) 90 DB HL or no response, and missing at frequencies ranged from 500 Hertz (Hz) to 8000 Hz at month 12 and 24. In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left ear separately. Rows according to air conduction categories at specified time points are reported in this outcome measure, only when there was a non-zero data for at least 1 reporting arm.

The Bayley-III assesses infant and toddler development across five domains: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional (SE), and adaptive behavior (AB). Assessments of the cognitive, language, and motor domains conducted using items administered to the child; assessments of the SE and AB domains conducted using the primary caregiver's responses to a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprises the SE scale (35 items) and the AB scale (241 items). Raw scores of SE and AB were converted to composite scores. Composite scores for SE and AB scale ranged from 40 to 160, where higher scores indicated better social-emotional skills and adaptive behavior in child. In this outcome measure composite scores for parent/caregiver were reported at month 24.
