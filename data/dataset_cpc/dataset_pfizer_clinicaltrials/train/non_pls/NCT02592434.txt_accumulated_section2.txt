Tanner stage is a scale used to document the stage of development of puberty by assessing the secondary sexual characteristics: Pubic hair (both male and female), breast size (for females); and size of the genitalia (for males) were assessed in this study and with values in the scale ranging from: Stage 1: no hair, Stage 2: downy hair, Stage 3: Scant terminal hair, Stage 4: Terminal hair that fills the entire triangle overlying the pubic region and Stage 5: Terminal hair that extends beyond the inguinal crease onto the thigh. Tanner Stage for pubic hair at Week 44 was summarized and reported using number of participants in each stage.
Time to disease flare:time (in days) from first dose of study drug until the day of disease flare in open-label phase. According to PRCSG/PRINTO, disease flare: worsening of >=30% in >=3 of 6 variables of JIA core set, with no more than 1 variable improving by >=30%. 6 core variables were: 1) Number of joints with active arthritis (joint with swelling or in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by pain/ tenderness), 2) Number of joints with limited range of motion, 3) Physician global evaluation of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 4) Parent/legal guardian/participant global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor], 5) CHAQ-DI: 30 questions in 8 domains, each question answered on scale of 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; scores of each domain were averaged to derive total CHAQ-DI score, which ranges from 0 (minimum dysfunction) to 3 (most severe dysfunction);6) ESR.
