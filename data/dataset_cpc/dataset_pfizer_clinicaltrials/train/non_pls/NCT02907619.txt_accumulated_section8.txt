Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to dosing on Day 1 in B5161004. Week 1 was counted starting from the study treatment in study B5161004.
An Open-label Extension Study To Evaluate Safety Of PF-06252616 In Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
In study B5161002 (parent study) participants randomized to Sequence group 3 received placebo in Period 1 (48 weeks). In Period 2, participants received domagrozumab (PF-06252616) in a dose escalating fashion (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg). At each dose level, domagrozumab was administered over 2 hours by IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. There was no pause between Period 1 and Period 2 (48 weeks each). In study B5161004 (OLE) participants received domagrozumab 40 mg/kg (the maximum tolerated dose from B5161002) every 4 weeks until early termination of this study. The OLE study reports participants within the treatment assignment they received in the parent study.
Tanner staging was performed before the first dose of this study to monitor for signs of accelerated sexual development. The physical changes in pubertal development (pubic hair, penis and testes) were assessed using the system described by Marshall and Tanner. Stage 1 is preadolescent, Stages 2, 3, and 4 are initiation of puberty and Stage 5 is mature adult. Details about the system can be referred to Tanner JM. Growth at Adolescence. Blackwell Scientific Publications 1962; 2nd edition.
Participant's Week 97 visit within study B5161002 (parent study) was collected as screening data.
The PUL scale was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb for individuals with DMD. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into 3 levels; shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 to 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores; shoulder maximum 16, middle level maximum score 34 and distal level maximum score 24.
This study is an open-label extension to protocol B5161002 and will provide an assessment of the long term safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of intravenous dosing of PF 06252616 in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Approximately 105 eligible subjects will be assigned to receive a monthly individualized maximum tolerated dose based on their tolerability profile/data from B5161002. This study will not contain a placebo comparator. Subjects will undergo safety evaluations (Laboratory, cardiac monitoring, physical exams, x-ray, MRI), functional capacity evaluations (4 stair climb, range of motion, strength testing, Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, upper limb functional testing, six minute walk test and pulmonary function tests) and pharmacokinetic testing.
