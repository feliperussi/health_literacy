Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Crisaborole in Adults With Stasis Dermatitis
ISGA: global assessment of stasis dermatitis lesions severity based on erythema, papulation/elevation, superficial erosion/denudation, and scaling, excluding scalp. ISGA score ranged from 0 to 4; 0 = clear (minor residual hypo/hyperpigmentation; no erythema or induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation with or without oozing/crusting), 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting). Higher scores = greater severity. Treatment success: ISGA score of clear/almost clear with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline. Participants acquired static digital images of the lesions using sponsor-provisioned digital imaging equipment. Images were reviewed by central readers.
ISGA is a global assessment of stasis dermatitis lesions severity based on erythema, papulation/elevation, superficial erosion/denudation, and scaling. ISGA excludes scalp from scoring and assessment. ISGA score ranged from 0 to 4; where 0 = clear (minor residual hypo/hyperpigmentation; no erythema or induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation with or without oozing/crusting), 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting). Higher scores indicated greater severity. Participants acquired static digital images of the lesions using sponsor-provisioned digital imaging equipment. Images were reviewed by central readers.

Higher scores indicated greater severity. The assessment was completed in person by the home visit practitioner.
