SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 75 response is a 75% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from initial 24-week treatment period placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 30 response is a 30% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo. The 90% CI was calculated using Chan and Zhang method.
SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 50 response is a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease. The analysis was done using FAS (full analysis set) based on Non-responder imputation (ie. set missing values to be non-responsive) data. The percentage(Number) and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Arms(PF-06651600 and PF-06700841) in this outcome measurement is the percentage and 90% CI for difference from placebo.
