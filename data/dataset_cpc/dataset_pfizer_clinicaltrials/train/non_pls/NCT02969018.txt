The purpose of this study is to determine whether PF-06700841 is safe and effective in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.
Study To Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Of PF-06700841 In Subjects With Moderate To Severe Plaque Psoriasis
ECG categorical summarization criteria: 1) QRS duration (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization): >=140 milliseconds (msec), >=50% change from baseline; 2) PR interval (the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization): >=300 msec, >=25% change when baseline is > 200 msec or >=50% change when baseline is less than or equal to (<=) 200 msec; 3) QT interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole): absolute value of >=500 msec; 4) QTc interval (QT corrected for heart rate): absolute value of 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; a change from baseline of 30 to <60 msec or >=60 msec.
The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the four body areas is the PASI. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 units from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing increasing severity of psoriasis.
