4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin/genitals) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Overall % BSA for an individual % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.
Time (in days) to loss of response based on achieving IGA >=2 was measured from date of first dose of randomized treatment until last dose of randomized treatment (if not entered rescue) or first day of rescue treatment (if entered rescue) and based on EASI, loss of at least 50% of EASI response at Week 12 and IGA score of 2 or higher. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores=more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling with scores 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe. EASI quantifies severity of AD based on severity of lesion clinical signs and % of BSA affected. EASI composite score evaluates degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification.
