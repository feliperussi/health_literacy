This 4-week study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of crisaborole ointment 2%; crisaborole vehicle; topical corticosteroid and topical calcineurin inhibitor, applied twice daily (BID) in subjects who are at least 2 years of age with mild-moderate AD.
EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp) based on lesion severity and %BSA affected. Lesion severity included erythema (E), induration/papulation (I), excoriation (Ex), lichenification (L) scored for 4 regions (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] [including axillae, groin], lower limbs [l] [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score(A) based upon %BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%), 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score (aged >=8 years) =0.1*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et + It +Ext + Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll); for aged 2 to <8 years =0.2*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et +It + Ext + Lt) + 0.3*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll). Total score ranges from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores indicated greater AD severity.
ISGA is a five point global assessment scale of AD severity, used to characterize participants' overall disease severity across all treatable AD lesions (excluding the scalp). ISGA score ranged from 0 to 4: where 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyperpigmentation; no erythema or induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration/papulation with or without oozing/crusting), 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration/papulation and with oozing/crusting). Higher scores indicated greater severity of AD.

Higher scores indicated greater severity of AD.
The CDLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on children's (aged 4 to 15 years) quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranged from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect on the child's life; 2-6 = small effect; 7-12 = moderate effect; 13-18 = very large effect; 19-30 = extremely large effect. Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.
Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae) and lower limbs (including buttocks) excluding scalp. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were: 10 for head, neck (20 for <8 years age), 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk, 40 for lower limbs (30 for <8 years age). Surface area (SA) of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 10% for head, neck (5% for <8 years age), 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk, 2.5% for lower limbs (3.33% for <8 years age). Overall %BSA for a body region = total number of handprints in a body region * % SA equivalent to 1 handprint. % BSA for an individual: mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, range =0-100%, higher values = greater AD severity.
A Sub-Study of Optical Coherence Tomography and Biomarkers in Subjects ages 2 to <18 years old, with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis, treated with Crisaborole Ointment, 2% or Crisaborole Vehicle Ointment or Hydrocortisone Butyrate 0.1% Cream applied BID will also be conducted at select sites.
A Study of Crisaborole Ointment 2%; Crisaborole Vehicle; TCS and TCI in Subjects Aged â‰¥ 2 Years, With Mild-moderate AD
EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp) based on lesion severity and percent (%) body surface area (%BSA) affected. Lesion severity included erythema (E), induration/papulation (I), excoriation (Ex), lichenification (L) scored for 4 regions (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] [including axillae, groin], lower limbs [l] [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score (A) based upon %BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%), 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score (aged >=8 years) =0.1*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et + It +Ext + Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll); for aged 2 to <8 years =0.2*Ah*(Eh + Ih + Exh + Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu + Iu + Exu + Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et +It + Ext + Lt) + 0.3*Al*(El + Il + Exl + Ll). Total score ranges from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores indicated greater AD severity.
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. TEAEs are events between the first dose of study drug up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death; is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or that is considered to be an important medical event.
The DFI was a 10-item disease questionnaire that measures the impact of having a child (aged 2-17 years) with AD on family quality of life. It was completed by parent/legal guardian of the child (affected by AD), based on recall over the past week. Each question was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): where higher scores indicated worst quality of life of family. The DFI total score was the sum of individual scores of the 10 questions and ranged from 0 (no impact on life of family) to 30 (maximum effect on life of family), where higher DFI scores indicated maximum effect on life of family.
