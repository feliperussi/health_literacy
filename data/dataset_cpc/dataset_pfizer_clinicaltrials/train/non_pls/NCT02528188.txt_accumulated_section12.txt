PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your OA in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (> 0 %; >= 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%; =100%) in WOMAC physical function subscale from baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
Progression of OA according to Bland-Altman methodology as defined by a decrease in JSW >=1.96 times within-participant standard deviation of the change in JSW in the index hip. The number of participants with progression of OA in the index hip per Bland-Altman methodology are reported. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of hip OA using five grades i.e. 0 (no radiographic features of OA), 1 (doubtful JSN and possible osteophytic lipping), 2 (definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph), 3 (multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity), 4 (large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity). Higher grade indicating worse hip function.
EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Responses from the five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (the Overall health utility score) where values are less than or equal to (<=) 1. The Overall health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a participant reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.
TSQM v.II is a self-administered 11-item validated scale that quantified participant's level of satisfaction with study medication (scored on a 7-point Likert scale [1= extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=dissatisfied, 4=somewhat satisfied, 5=satisfied, 6=very satisfied, 7=extremely satisfied]) and dissatisfaction with side effects (3 questions scored on 5 point Likert scale [1= extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=slightly dissatisfied, 5=not at all dissatisfied] and 1 question on 2 point scale [0 =No, 1=Yes]). Participants were asked to assess their level of satisfaction taking all things into account. The 11 questions of the TSQM were used to calculate the 4 endpoints of effectiveness, side Effects, convenience and global satisfaction, each scored on a 0-100 scale with 100 being the best level of satisfaction.
The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess participant willingness to use drug again, participants responded using IRT on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I would definitely want to use the same drug again, 2= I might want to use the same drug again, 3= I am not sure, 4= I might not want to use the same drug again, 5= no, I definitely would not want to use the same drug again. Higher scores indicate lesser willingness to use the investigational product. Number of participants who responded for the specified question were reported.
WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [no difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.
The purpose of this study is to compare the long-term joint safety and efficacy (pain relief) of the investigational study drug, tanezumab compared to non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in subjects with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees.
A 12-lead ECG was recorded after participants had rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position in a quiet environment. All standard intervals (PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, QTcB, RR intervals) were collected. ECG abnormalities included: 1) QT interval, QT interval corrected using Bazett's formula (QTcB) and QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF): increase from baseline greater than (>) 30 millisecond (ms) or 60 ms; absolute value > 450 ms, >480 ms and > 500 ms; 2) heart rate (HR) : absolute value <=50 bpm and decrease from baseline >=20 bpm; absolute value >=120 beats per minute (bpm) and increase from baseline >=20 bpm; 3) PR interval: absolute value >=220 ms and increase from baseline >=20 ms; 4) QRS interval: absolute value >= 120 ms.
Progression of OA according to Bland-Altman as defined by a decrease JSW >=1.96 times within-participant standard deviation of change in JSW. The number of participants with progression of OA in the index knee are summarized separately by the compartment of OA at baseline (medial or lateral). Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of knee OA using five grades i.e. 0 [no radiographic features of OA], 1 [doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping], 2 [definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph], 3 [multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity], 4 [large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity]. Higher grade indicating worse knee function.
WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than [>] 0% ; >= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your OA in your knee or hip (index joint) affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, using Interactive Response Technology (IRT), where 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5= very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worsening of condition.
