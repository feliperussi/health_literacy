PFS was defined as time from randomization to earliest objective evidence of prostate specific-antigen (PSA) progression, radiographic progression, or death on study. PSA progression was defined as ≥ 25% increase in PSA with an absolute increase ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir and was to be confirmed by a second consecutive assessment. Radiographic progression in bone was based on The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan. Radiographic progression in soft tissue on Computerized Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CT/MRI) was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CT/MRI and bone scans were read locally by the same radiologist (or nuclear medicine physician for interpretation of bone scans) whenever possible. Participants not known to have had a PFS event at the time of the analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment.
Duration of radiographic PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence of radiographic disease progression or death on study and was to be evaluated for participants with metastatic disease at study entry. Radiographic disease progression in bone was based on PCWG2 guidelines defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan. Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue on CT/MRI was based on RECIST 1.1. CT/MRI and bone scans were read locally by the same radiologist (or nuclear medicine physician for interpretation of bone scans) whenever possible. Participants not known to have had radiographic progression at the time of analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last radiographic assessment.
The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess patient function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as a global quality of life score (0 to 156) with higher scores representing better quality of life. Time to degradation of FACT-P was defined as the time from randomization to first assessment with at least a 10-point decrease from baseline in the global FACT-P score for each participant. Participants with no score degradation at the time of analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment showing no degradation.
