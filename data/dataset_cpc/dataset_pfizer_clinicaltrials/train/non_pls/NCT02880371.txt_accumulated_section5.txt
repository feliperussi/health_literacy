DLT: adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value not clearly attributable to an extraneous cause, such as disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications occurring during 21 days of Cycle 1, met 1 of the criteria A) nonhematologic AEs: recurring grade 2 pneumonitis, grade 3 events (irAE, QTcF prolongation, rash; other grade 3/4 except alopecia, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, tumor flare, pseudoprogression, endocrinopathy); B) hematology AEs/laboratory abnormalities: grade 4 events except lymphopenia, neutropenia, electrolyte imbalances or abnormalities, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, grade 4 AST/ALT elevation, grade 3 AST/ALT elevation lasting >7 days, associated with bilirubin levels>=2*ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5, grade 3 bilirubin elevation >=3, CK elevation >=grade 3 lasting, increase in creatinine >=1.5*baseline value, dose delay (dose interruption for >14 days) or other (inability to receive at least 67% of ARRY-382 doses).
Different MR reported for single dose calculated at Cycle 1 Day 1 were as follows: 1) MRAUClast = ratio of AUClast values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight, where AUClast was area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable time point; 2) MRCmax = ratio of Cmax values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight. Different MR reported for steady state calculated at Cycle 2 Day 1 were as follows: 1) MRAUCtau,ss = ratio of AUCtau,ss values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight, where AUCtau was area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a dosing interval at steady-state; 2) MRCmax,ss = Ratio of Cmax,ss values of the metabolite compared to parent, corrected for molecular weight.
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARRY-382 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Part A/Phase 1b); and to estimate the efficacy of the combination in three separate cohorts: 1) patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed on prior PD-1/PD-L1inhibitors, 2) patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and 3) patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).
Vital signs included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, body temperature and weight. Low SBP: less than or equal to (<=)90 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) with decrease from baseline of >=20 mmHg. High SBP: >=160 mmHg with increase from baseline of >=20 mmHg. Low DBP: <=50 mmHg with decrease from baseline of >=15 mmHg. High DBP: >=100 mmHg with increase from baseline of >=15 mmHg. Low heart rate: <=50 beats/min with decrease from baseline of >=15 beats/min. High heart rate: >=120 beats/min with increase from baseline of >=15 beats/min. Low temperature: <=36 degree Celsius (C). High temperature: >=37.5 degree C. Low Weight: decrease from baseline >=20%. High weight: increase from baseline >=10%.
PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If a participant did not have a PFS event at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new anticancer therapy, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. PD = at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) and an absolute increase of >= 5 mm or appearance of at least 1 new lesion. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
