MDASI-AML/MDS: consists of 23 items, 13-item core cancer symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, problem remembering, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, and numbness), 4-item AML/MDS specific symptoms (malaise, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and skin problems), and 6 areas of interference (general activity, mood, work, walking, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life). "Fatigue" was measured at the participants' worst level in last 24 hours by asking participants to respond to each item on an 0-10 NRS, where 0 = "not present" and 10 = "as bad as you can imagine". Percentage of participants who had improvement in "fatigue" symptoms reported in this outcome measure.
DoRi: only defined for participants who have ever achieved CRi or better (included CR and CRh) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRi or better to the date of relapse after CRi or better or death due to any cause. DoRh: participants who had ever achieved CRh or better (included CR) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRh or better to the date of disease progression, or relapse after CRh or better, or death due to any cause. CRi: not qualifying for CR, neutrophil <0.5*10^9/L or platelets <50*10^9, absence of extramedullary disease, and absence of blasts with Auer rods. CRh: MRD (positive or unknown); bone marrow blasts <5%; assessed in non-intensive chemotherapy study only, not qualifying for CR, ie, both neutrophil >=0.5*10^9/L and platelets >=50*10^9/L must be met, but does not satisfy both neutrophils >=1*10^9/L and platelets >=100*10^9/L at the same time; absence of extramedullary disease; and absence of blasts with Auer rods.
EQ-5D-5L: brief, self-administered, validated and reliable generic health status instrument developed by the EuroQoL Group. It consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS), the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). EQ-5D: descriptive system measures a participant's health state on 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by rating each dimension on a 5-level scale (1=no problem, 5=extreme problem). This rating resulted in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The EQ-5D index scores ranges from 0 to 1, with 0=worst health state and 1=perfect health.
DoRi: only defined for participants who have ever achieved CRi or better (included CR as well) on study as the time from date of first achieving CRi or better to the date of relapse after CRi or better or death due to any cause. CRi: not qualifying for CR, neutropenia <1.0*10^9/L or platelets <100*10^9, absence of extramedullary disease, and absence of blasts with Auer rods. CR was defined based on 2017 ELN recommendations. CR: Bone marrow blasts <5 %; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC >=1.0*10^9/L; platelet count >=100*10^9/L. Participants last known to be alive who were free from relapse after CRi or better were censored at the date of last disease assessment that verifies their status.
Participants received first induction therapy (28 days) (backbone chemotherapy+experimental therapy). Backbone chemotherapy: Cytarabine 100 mg/m^2 daily by IV infusion for 7 days along with daunorubicin 60 mg/m^2 daily IV for 3 days. Depending upon bone marrow blast or investigator judgement participants had second induction i.e. received either same backbone therapy or cytarabine 100 mg/m^2 IV daily for 5 days and daunorubicin 60 mg/m^2 IV daily for 2 days. Participants with <5% bone marrow blasts entered into consolation phase- treated with either or both of following: 1) cytarabine 1 to 3 gm/m^2 IV for adults >=60 to <60 years twice daily on Days 1, 3, and 5 for 4 cycle (each cycle 28 day) or cytarabine per local prescribing information. 2) Received HSCT per local standard of care. Experimental Therapy: Participants were to receive Glasdegib 100 mg tablet PO QD from Day 1 of chemotherapy up to 28 days in both induction until 2 consecutive CRMRD-negative central laboratory results, whichever came first (1.6 year).
