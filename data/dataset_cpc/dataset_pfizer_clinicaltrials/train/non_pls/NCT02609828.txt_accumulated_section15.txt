Weekly average pain intensity in the non-index cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. Non-index cancer pan sites were the most painful cancer pain sites other than the index bone metastasis cancer pain site. The participants described their weekly pain at the painful site by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline weekly average pain intensity was weekly average pain intensity NRS score recorded on any day during the baseline assessment period. Five days prior to dosing was considered as baseline assessment period. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weekly average pain intensity value was the weekly average pain intensity NRS scores recorded on any day from the span of 7 days prior to specified week.

Participants at specified time points, answered to the following question, "Considering all the ways your cancer pain affects you, how are you doing today?" on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, on IRT diaries. Scores:1= very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities); 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities); 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities); and 5= very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores signified worsening of condition.
Weekly worst pain intensity in the non-index cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), higher scores signified more severity of pain. Non-index cancer pan sites were the most painful cancer pain sites other than the index bone metastasis cancer pain site. The participants describe their weekly worst pain at the painful site by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline weekly worst pain intensity was weekly worst pain intensity NRS score recorded on any day during the baseline assessment period. Five days prior to dosing was considered as baseline assessment period. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weekly worst pain intensity value was the weekly worst pain intensity NRS scores which was recorded on any day from the span of 7 days prior to specified week.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether tanezumab is effective in the treatment of cancer pain due to bone metastasis in patients already taking background opioid therapy.
Daily average pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants recorded their daily average pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on interactive response technology (IRT) diaries. Baseline daily average pain intensity value was mean of the daily average pain intensity NRS scores during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization. Baseline assessment period was up to 5 days prior to dosing. The Week 8 daily average pain intensity value was the mean of the daily average pain intensity NRS scores recorded for each of the 7 days prior to the Week 8.
Phase 3 Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Tanezumab in Patients With Cancer Pain Due to Bone Metastasis Who Are Taking Background Opioid Therapy
OR-SDS: questionnaire evaluated opioid-related 12 symptoms. For each symptom, participants assigned integer scores to assess severity (none =0 to very severe =4), distress (none =0 to very much =5), and frequency (none =0 to almost constantly =4; participants reported number of retching/vomiting episodes (none =0, 1-2 episodes =1, 3-4 episodes =2, 5-6 episodes =3, >6 episodes =4). Frequency composite score: mean of frequency scores from all symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 4 (almost constantly); higher scores = worse condition. Severity composite score: mean of severity scores from all 12 symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 4 (maximum severity); higher scores = worse condition. Distress composite score: mean of distress scores from all 12 symptoms, ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (maximum distress); higher scores = worse condition. Multi domain average (MDA): average of each symptom for frequency, severity, and distress; ranged from 0 (none) to 4.34 (worse); higher scores = worse condition.
Orthostatic hypotension was defined as postural change (supine to standing) that met the following criteria: for systolic blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to (<=) 150 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) (mean supine): reduction in systolic BP >=20 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP >=10 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. For systolic BP greater than (>) 150 mmHg (mean supine): reduction in systolic BP >=30 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP >=15 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. If the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP in a sequence met the orthostatic hypotension criteria, then that sequence was considered positive. If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 24 weeks post last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and all non-serious AEs. Participants were followed up to 24 weeks after study drug last dose.
Daily worst pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site is assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants describe their daily worst pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline daily worst pain intensity was mean of daily worst pain intensity NRS score during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization.

Daily average pain intensity in the non-index visceral cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores signified more severity of pain. The participants described their pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. Baseline is defined as the mean average daily pain intensity NRS score during the baseline assessment period prior to randomization. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 pain intensity value is the mean of the daily average pain intensity scores for the 7 days prior to the each specified week.
Daily worst pain intensity in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site was assessed by participants on an 11 point pain intensity NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores = more severity of pain. The participants recorded their daily worst pain at the painful site during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10 on IRT diaries. The Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 pain intensity value = mean of the daily worst pain intensity NRS scores for the 7 days prior to the each week. Number of participants with cumulative reduction of >= 30, 50, 70, and 90 % in daily worst pain intensity NRS score in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 were reported. Participants might be reported more than once in the specified rows for a time point. Rows with only non-zero data for cumulative reduction at specified time points, for at least 1 reporting arm, are reported below.
