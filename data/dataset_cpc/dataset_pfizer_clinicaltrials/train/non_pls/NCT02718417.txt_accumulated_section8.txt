PFS2 was defined as time (in months) from the date of randomization to the start of second subsequent treatment after first documentation of PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression as per RECIST version 1.1, was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.
In CP, based on investigator's decision, participants received either: paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, IV infusion, followed by carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion (carboplatin dose [milligrams](mg) = Target AUC [milligrams*minute per milliliter] (mg*min/mL) x GFR mL/min + 25), and maximum carboplatin dose = target AUC x (150 mL/min) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6; or Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV infusion over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15, along with carboplatin dose at AUC 5 or 6, IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1 to 6. Each cycle was of 21 days (3 weeks). After completion of CP, participants were followed for survival status until death or until study completion, whichever was earlier or a maximum duration of 24 months in observation phase. Participants were then followed up to a maximum of 36 months.
EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). In VAS, participants rated their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Published weights are available that allow for the creation of a single summary score. 57 overall scores ranged from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.
Ctrough is the concentration at the end of the dosing interval when avelumab was given as a Q2W regimen in the absence of carboplatin and paclitaxel following 1 cycle of avelumab dosing, i.e. before administration of drug on Day 1 of cycle 2. The LLQ of avelumab was 0.20 mcg/mL. Data for this outcome measure was not reported for reporting arms "PK: Chemotherapy followed by Avelumab" (data not available for this OM as avelumab was not given along with paclitaxel and carboplatin in this arm) and "PK: Chemotherapy followed by Observation" (since avelumab was not administered in this arm and therefore data collection was not planned).
nAb against avelumab in serum samples was determined and reported separately for nAb never-positive and nAb ever-positive participants. Participants were considered nAb ever-positive if they had at least one positive nAb results (less than or equal to cut point of 0.710 in qualitative competitive ligand binding assay) at any time point during 36 months. nAb never-positive participants were those who had at least one negative nAb results (greater than cut point of 0.710 in qualitative competitive ligand binding assay) at any time point. Data for this outcome measure was not planned to be collected and analyzed for reporting arm "Chemotherapy followed by Observation", since, avelumab was not administered in this arm.
As per NCI-CTCAE v 4.03, Grade 3 and above criteria were; Hematology [Anemia - Grade 3: hemoglobin <8.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL), <4.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), <80 grams per liter (g/L), transfusion indicated, Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated, Grade 5: death; platelet count decreased- Grade 3:<50.0 to 25.0*10^9/Liters(L), Grade 4: <25.0*10^9/L; lymphocyte count decreased-Grade 3: <0.5-0.2*10^9/L, Grade 4: <0.2*10^9/L; neutrophil count decreased-Grade 3: <1.0 to 0.5*10^9 /L, Grade 4: <0.5*10^9/L]. Chemistry [creatinine increased-Grade 3: >3.0 to 6.0*upper limit of normal (ULN), Grade 4: >6.0*ULN; serum amylase increased, lipase increased-Grade 3: >2.0 - 5.0*ULN, Grade 4: >5.0*ULN]. Liver function [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-Grade 3: >5.0 to 20.0*ULN, Grade 4: >20.0*ULN].
PFS by GCIG was assessed by both RECIST 1.1 and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). It was defined as time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST 1.1, PD: greater than or equal to (>=) 20 % increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with absolute increase >= 5 millimeters. PD based on serum CA-125 was defined as (i) participants with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125, (ii) participants with CA-125 in the reference range before treatment; (i) and (ii) must have showed CA-125 >= 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions >= 1 week apart, or (iii) participants with elevated CA-125 before treatment, which never normalized, showed CA-125 >= 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions >= 1 week apart. Censoring date for PFS by GCIG was the latest of the censoring dates for PFS by RECIST 1.1 and PFS by CA-125.
