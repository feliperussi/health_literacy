PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: "Considering all the ways your OA in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?" Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (> 0 %; >= 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%; =100%) in WOMAC physical function subscale from baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.
