Time to first occurrence of major bleeding event was defined as the time interval (in days) between date of first study treatment and date of documentation of first major bleeding event. A bleeding event was considered as major if it was clinically overt and satisfies 1 or more of the following criteria: fatal bleeding, bleeding accompanied by a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 grams per deciliter, overt bleeding deemed by the attending physician to necessitate permanent discontinuation of trial medication, overt bleeding deemed by the attending physician to be unrelated to the participant's underlying condition and accompanied by blood product administration, bleeding occurred at a critical site (intraocular, intracranial, retroperitoneal or intraspinal).
A bleeding event was considered as major if it was clinically overt and satisfies 1 or more of the following criteria: fatal bleeding, bleeding accompanied by a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 grams per deciliter 24 hours, Overt bleeding deemed by the attending physician to necessitate permanent discontinuation of trial medication, Overt bleeding deemed by the attending physician to be unrelated to the participant's underlying condition and accompanied by blood product administration or bleeding occurred at a critical site (intraocular, intracranial, retroperitoneal). A bleeding event was considered as minor if it was clinically overt but not meeting the criteria for major or clinically relevant no major bleeding (bleeding resulting in any medical or surgical interventions but which did not meet the criteria for major bleeding).
Three month treatment of acute VTE with Fragmin in pediatric cancer patients
It was defined as the time interval (in days) between date of first study treatment and date of documentation of first VTE. VTEs included both DVT and PE. DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes PE. When a blood clot breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called VTE. VTE was confirmed by at least one radiographic test and was defined as any new or progressive VTE whose signs and symptoms (identified by the investigator) included: objective swelling or tenderness, pitting edema, erythema or cyanosis.
