For AML cohort, CR was defined as neutrophils ≥ 1 x 10^9/L, platelets ≥ 1 x 10^11/L, percentage of bone marrow blasts (BMB) <5% with no peripheral blasts and no blasts with Auer rods, no extramedullary disease (EMD), and transfusion independent.
A Combination Study of PF-04449913 (Glasdegib) and Azacitidine In Untreated MDS, AML and CMML Patients
Percentage of participants achieving CR as defined by the 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) Response Criteria for all participants with AML and modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria (2006) for all participants with MDS in the expansion cohorts.
Number of participants with efficacy measures other than CR as defined by modified IWG criteria (2006) in LIC, including marrow CR(mCR), stable disease(SD), hematologic improvement(HI). CR: hemoglobin≥11 g/dL, neutrophils≥1 x 10^9/L, platelets≥1 x 10^11/L, percentage of blasts=0%, percentage of BMB≤5%, normal maturation of all cell lines (note if has persistent dysplasia), all responses last at least 4 weeks. mCR: BMB≤5% & decreased by≥50%. SD: failure to achieve PR, no evidence of progression. HI: erythroid response (pretreatment<11g/dL): hemoglobin increase by≥1.5 g/dL, relevant reduction of units of red blood cell transfusions by at least 4 transfusions/8 weeks compared to pretreatment transfusion number in previous 8 weeks; platelet response (pretreatment<1x10^11/L): increase of≥30x10^9/L if starting with >20x10^9/L, and increase from <20x10^9/L to >20x10^9/L and by at least 100%; neutrophil response (pretreatment<1x10^9/L): at least a 100% increase, absolute increase >0.5x10^9/L
Number of participants with CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), and morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS). CRh: neutrophils>5x10^8/L, platelets>5x10^10/L, BMB<5%, no peripheral blasts, no blasts with Auer rods, no extramedullary disease (EMD), not qualifying for CR. CRi: neutrophils <1x10^9/L or platelets<1x10^11/L; BMB <5%, no peripheral blasts, no blasts with Auer rods; no EMD; neutrophils or platelets not recovered; not qualifying for CRh. PR: neutrophils ≥1x10^9/L; platelets ≥1x10^11/L; blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pretreatment; blasts≤5% if Auer rod positive. SD: ≥3 months of absence of CR without minimal residual disease (CRMRD-), CR, CRh, CRi, PR, and MLFS, criteria for PD not met. MLFS: neutrophils <1x10^9/L and platelets<1x10^11/L, BMB<5%, no blasts with Auer rods; no EMD; neutrophils and platelets not recovered; not qualifying for CRi
Number of participants with PR, marrow CR (mCR), SD, complete or partial cytogenetic response, and hematologic improvement (HI). PR: BMB >5% and decreased by ≥50% (at least 4 weeks), meeting all CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except BMB. mCR: BMB ≤5% and decreased by ≥50%. SD: failure to achieve PR, no evidence of progression. Complete or partial cytogenic response: disappearance of chromosomal abnormality without new ones, or ≥ 50% reduction of chromosomal abnormality. HI: erythroid response (pretreatment <11g/dL): hemoglobin increase by≥1.5 g/dL, relevant reduction of units of red blood cell transfusions by at least 4 transfusions/8 weeks compared to pretreatment transfusion number in previous 8 weeks; platelet response (pretreatment <1x10^11/L): increase of ≥30x10^9/L if starting with >20x10^9/L, and increase from <20x10^9/L to >20x10^9/L and by at least 100%; neutrophil response (pretreatment <1x10^9/L): at least a 100% increase, absolute increase >0.5x10^9/L.
This multi center open label Phase 1b study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of glasdegib (PF-04449913) when combined with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). This clinical study includes two components: (a) a safety lead in cohort (LIC) and (b) an expansion phase with an AML cohort and an MDS cohort.
RR (Percentage of participants achieving CR+PR among all the enrolled and treated patients as defined by modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria (2006)) in the LIC. CR was defined as having responses of hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1 x 10^9/L, platelets ≥1 x 10^11/L, percentage of blasts = 0%, percentage of BMB≤5%, and normal maturation of all cell lines (note if has persistent dysplasia), and all responses must last at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as meeting all CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except BMB, percentage of BMB decreased by ≥50% but still >5% for at least 4 weeks.
