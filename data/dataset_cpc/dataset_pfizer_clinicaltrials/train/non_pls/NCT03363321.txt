Physical examinations were conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. A full physical examination included head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. The limited or abbreviated physical examination was focused on general appearance, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as towards participant reported symptoms. For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution was used and must have been placed on a stable, flat surface. Participants removed shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains. They also removed the contents of their pockets and remain still during measurement of weight.
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with PF-06741086 in subjects with severe hemophilia who participated in the 3-month Phase 1b/2 B7841002 study. Additionally, de novo subjects will be recruited into this study.
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator. Grades 3 AEs were severe and undesirable adverse events. Grades 4 AEs were life threatening or disabling adverse events.
