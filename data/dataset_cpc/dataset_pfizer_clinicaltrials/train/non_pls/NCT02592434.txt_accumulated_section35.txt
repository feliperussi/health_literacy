Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method. One of the participant's palm to proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb =\together represented 1% of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage (Head and Neck = 10% [10 palms], Upper extremities = 20% [20 palms], Trunk [axillae and groin] = 30% [30 palms], Lower extremities [buttocks] = 40% [40 palms]). The number of palms of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.

CHAQ is a valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18 in DI total score is reported.

Each subscale rated on Likert-type scale: range 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a more positive health status. Two summary scores: Physical Health and Psychosocial Health were weighted composites derived from subscale items using scoring algorithms (transformed scores); range 0 to 100: higher scores indicate more positive health status.
