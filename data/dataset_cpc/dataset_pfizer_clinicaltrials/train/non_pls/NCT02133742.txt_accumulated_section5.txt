DR:date of first documentation of objective tumour response(OR) confirmed to date of first documentation of PD/death due to any cause,whichever occurred first.PD per RECIST 1.1:>=20%increase in sum of longest dimensions(LD) of target lesions,reference to smallest sum of LD recorded since treatment started/appearance of 1 or more new lesions/increase of at least 5mm addition to relative increase of 20%.DR calculated only for participants with confirmed OR.Participants lacking evaluation of tumour response after date of first study drug dose was censored on date of first dose unless death occurred prior to 18 weeks.If participants had at least 1 on-study assessment,PFS was censored on date of last evaluable tumour disease assessment documenting absence of PD for participants who were alive and progression free at time of analysis/had documentation of PD/death after>=2 consecutive missed tumour assessments/given anti-tumour treatment other than study drug prior to documented PD/death.
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant and jeopardized the participants or required treatment to prevent other AE outcomes for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as Grade 3: Severe, Grade 4: Life threatening, Grade 5: Death related to AE. Participants were counted once according to the maximum grade observed.

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant and jeopardized the participants or required treatment to prevent other AE outcomes for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs are events which occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator.

ECOG performance status was used to assess how disease affect the daily living abilities of a participant. It was measured on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 0=fully active (able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction); 1=restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory (able to carry out light/sedentary work); 2=ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities (for more than 50% of waking hours); 3=capable of limited self-care, confined to bed or chair (for >50% of waking hours); 4=completely disabled, not capable of any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair. Higher scores signified =more functional impairment of a participant.
