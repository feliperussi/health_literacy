BASMI assess axial status and spinal mobility. It composed of 5 clinical measures: lateral spinal flexion, tragus-to-wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, cervical rotation. BASMI - Linear Method score was average of 5 individual component score mapped between 0 and 10, high score=more impairment of axial status, spinal mobility. For cervical rotation angle, participant sit straight on chair with chin level and hands on knees. Blinded assessor place goniometer at top of head in line with nose and ask participant to rotate neck maximally to left, follows with goniometer and record angle between sagittal plane and new plane after rotation. A second reading obtained and both readings recorded. Procedure repeated for right side. Better of two for each side was selected for scoring. Scoring done by calculating mean of left and right measurement and recorded in degrees (range: 0 to 90), higher cervical rotation value=better health status.
ASDAS(CRP) was derived using BASDAI (6-item questionnaire measures disease activity on a scale of 0 [none] to 10 [severe], higher score=more disease activity) and PGA (measure disease activity on a scale of 0 [not active] to 10 [very active], high score=more disease activity) and calculated by using the following formula, 0.121 x Back Pain (Q2 of BASDAI) + 0.058 x Duration of Morning Stiffness (Q6 of BASDAI) + 0.110 x PGA + 0.073 x Peripheral Pain/Swelling (Q3 of BASDAI) + 0.579 x Ln(high sensitivity [hs] CRP mg/Liter [L] + 1). If hsCRP values were smaller than 2 mg/L, they were set to 2 mg/L in the formula. The range of score was >= 0.636 to no defined upper limit. A negative change from baseline value indicates decrease in disease activity; a positive change from baseline value indicates increase in disease activity.
