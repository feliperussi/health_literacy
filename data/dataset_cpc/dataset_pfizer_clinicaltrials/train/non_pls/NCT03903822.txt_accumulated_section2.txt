EASI evaluates severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions(head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in each 4 body region: 0 (0%), 1 (>0 to <10%), 2 (10 to <30%), 3 (30 to <50%), 4 (50 to <70%), 5 (70 to <90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.
IGA assesses severity of participant's AD on a 5 point scale. 0= clear, no inflammatory signs of AD; 1= almost clear, AD not fully cleared- light pink residual lesions (except post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), just perceptible erythema, papulation/induration lichenification, excoriation, and no oozing/crusting; 2= mild AD with light red lesions, slight but definite erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and no oozing/crusting; 3= moderate AD with red lesions, moderate erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and slight oozing/crusting and 4= severe AD with deep dark red lesions, severe erythema, papulation/induration, lichenification, excoriation and moderate to severe oozing/crusting. Higher scores indicating more severity of AD. Assessment excluded soles, palms and scalp.
