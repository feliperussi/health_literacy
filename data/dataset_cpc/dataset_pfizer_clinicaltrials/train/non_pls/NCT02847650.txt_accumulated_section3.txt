Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-06649751 in Parkinson's Disease Patients at Early Stage of the Disease
ECG categorical summarization criteria: 1) QRS duration (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricle depolarization): >=140 milliseconds (msec), >=50% increase from baseline; 2) PR interval (the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization): >=300 msec, >=25% increase when baseline is > 200 msec or >=50% increase when baseline is less than or equal to (<=) 200 msec; 3) QT interval (time from ECG Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole): absolute value of >=500 msec; 4) QTcF interval (QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula): absolute value of 450 to <480 msec, 480 to <500 msec, >=500 msec; an increase from baseline of 30 to <60 msec or >=60 msec.
Eligible participants were up-titrated in a double-blind fashion to an optimal dose level of PF-06649751 according to a flexible dose titration scheme (from 0.25 mg to 15 mg once daily [QD]). The 15-week treatment period included 9 weeks of dose optimization and 6 weeks of stable dosing. Blinded PF-06649751 was provided as tablets for oral administration in the outpatient setting (each morning, daily for the duration of the treatment period). Reaching of the maximum allowed dose level (15 mg) was not mandatory; participants might achieve a satisfactory clinical response at a lower dose level. There was an additional follow-up period of 28 days following discontinuation of PF-06649751.
