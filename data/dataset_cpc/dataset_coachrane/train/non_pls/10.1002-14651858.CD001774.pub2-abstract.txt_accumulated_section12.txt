Background
The impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer remains uncertain. 
Objectives
This review of individual patient data (IPD) aimed to assess the effect of; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical radiotherapy compared to the same radiotherapy; and Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery compared to radical radiotherapy. 
Search methods
Searches of Medline, CancerLit and trial registers were supplemented by hand‐searching conference proceedings and contacting relevant trialists. Searches have been updated to February 2006. 
Selection criteria
Trials had to be properly randomised and include patients with locally advanced cervical cancer who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy either before radiotherapy or surgery (or both). 
Data collection and analysis
We collected, validated and re‐analysed updated trial data on all randomised patients from all relevant trials. The person responsible for the trial resolved queries and verified the final data. Treatment comparisons 1 and 2 were analysed separately. For all outcomes, we obtained overall hazard ratios using the fixed‐effect model. We pre‐specified analyses that grouped trials by important aspects of their design and patients by their or their tumour characteristics, to assess whether they might influence the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Main results
We obtained data from 18 trials and 2074 patients for the first comparison. Considering these trials together there was a high level of statistical heterogeneity, a substantial amount of which was explained by analyses of trial groups. Trials using chemotherapy cycle lengths shorter than 14 days (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.00, p = 0.046) or cisplatin dose intensities greater than 25 mg/m2 per week (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.05, p = 0.20) tended to show an advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on survival. In contrast, trials using cycle lengths longer than 14 days (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.46, p = 0.005) or cisplatin dose intensities lower than 25 mg/m2 per week (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.14, p = 0.002) showed a detrimental effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on survival. In the second comparison, data from 5 trials and 872 patients were obtained. The combined results (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.80, p = 0.0004) indicated a highly significant reduction in the risk of death with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but with heterogeneity in both the design and results.
