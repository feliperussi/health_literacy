Background
Belimumab, the first biologic approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), has been shown to reduce autoantibody levels in people with SLE and help control disease activity. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of belimumab (alone or in combination) in systematic lupus erythematosus. 
Search methods
An Information Specialist carried out the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 25 September 2019. There were no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of belimumab (alone or in combination) compared to placebo/control treatment (immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or another biologic), in adults with SLE. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Six RCTs (2917 participants) qualified for quantitative analyses. All included studies were multicenter, international or US‐based. The age range of the included participants was 22 to 80 years; most were women; and study duration ranged from 84 days to 76 weeks. The risk of bias was generally low except for attrition bias, which was high in 67% of studies. 
Compared to placebo, more participants on belimumab 10 mg/kg (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved dose) showed at least a 4‐point improvement (reduction) in Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National Assessment (SELENA) ‐ Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, a validated SLE disease activity index: (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.45; 829/1589 in belimumab group and 424/1077 in placebo; I2= 0%; 4 RCTs; high‐certainty evidence).
