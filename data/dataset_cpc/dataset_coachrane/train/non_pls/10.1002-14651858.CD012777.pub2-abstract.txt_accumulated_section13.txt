Background
Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV is difficult. HIV‐positive individuals have higher rates of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the diagnosis of tuberculosis is often limited to imaging results. Ultrasound is such an imaging test that is widely used as a diagnostic tool (including point‐of‐care) in people suspected of having abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound for detecting abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement in HIV‐positive individuals. 
To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including clinical setting, ultrasound training level, and type of reference standard. 
Search methods
We searched for publications in any language up to 4 April 2019 in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S), and also ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional, cohort, and diagnostic case‐control studies (prospective and retrospective) that compared the result of the index test (abdominal ultrasound) with one of the reference standards. We only included studies that allowed for extraction of numbers of true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs). Participants were HIV‐positive individuals aged 15 years and older. A higher‐quality reference standard was the bacteriological confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from any clinical specimen, and a lower‐quality reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis without microbiological confirmation. We excluded genitourinary tuberculosis. 
Data collection and analysis
For each study, two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. We assessed the quality of studies using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity. When studies were few we simplified the bivariate model to separate univariate random‐effects logistic regression models for sensitivity and specificity. We explored the influence of the type of reference standard on the accuracy estimates by conducting separate analyses for each type of reference standard. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 11 studies. The risks of bias and concern about applicability were often high or unclear in all domains. We included six studies in the main analyses of any abnormal finding on abdominal ultrasound; five studies reported only individual lesions.
