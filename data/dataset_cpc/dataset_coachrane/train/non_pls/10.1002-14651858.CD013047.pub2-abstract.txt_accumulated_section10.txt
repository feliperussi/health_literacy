Background
Gliomas are brain tumours arising from glial cells with an annual incidence of 4 to 11 people per 100,000. In this review we focus on gliomas with low aggressive potential in the short term, i.e. low‐grade gliomas. Most people with low‐grade gliomas are treated with surgery and may receive radiotherapy thereafter. However, there is concern about the possible long‐term effects of radiotherapy, especially on neurocognitive functioning. 
Objectives
To evaluate the long‐term neurocognitive and other side effects of radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) compared with no radiotherapy, or different types of radiotherapy, among people with glioma (where 'long‐term' is defined as at least two years after diagnosis); and to write a brief economic commentary. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 16 February 2018 and updated the search on 14 November 2018: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; and Embase via Ovid. We also searched clinical trial registries and relevant conference proceedings from 2014 to 2018 to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and non‐randomised trials, and controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAS). Participants were aged 16 years and older with cerebral glioma other than glioblastoma. We included studies where patients in at least one treatment arm received radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, and where neurocognitive outcomes were assessed two or more years after treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of findings using the GRADE approach.
