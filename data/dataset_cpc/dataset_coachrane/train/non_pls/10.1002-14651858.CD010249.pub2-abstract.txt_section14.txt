Modified bovine minced lung surfactant extract compared with porcine minced lung surfactant extract: Nine treatment studies compared modified bovine minced lung surfactant extract to porcine minced lung surfactant extract. Meta‐analysis of these trials demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of mortality prior to hospital discharge (typical RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.00; typical RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10; NNTH 20, 95% CI 10 to 100; 9 studies and 901 infants; moderate quality evidence), death or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (typical RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.64; typical RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20; NNTH 9, 95% CI 5 to 50; 3 studies and 448 infants; moderate quality evidence), receiving more than one dose of surfactant (typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.92; typical RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.20; NNTH 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 6 studies and 786 infants), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring treatment (typical RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.70; typical RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.43; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2 to 8; 3 studies and 137 infants) in infants treated with modified bovine minced lung surfactant extract compared with porcine minced lung surfactant extract. In the subgroup analysis based on initial dose of surfactant, improvement in mortality prior to discharge (typical RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.38; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 16, 95% CI 9 to 100) and risk of death or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (typical RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.79; typical RD 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.23; NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 33) was limited to higher initial dose of porcine minced lung surfactant (> 100 mg/kg).
