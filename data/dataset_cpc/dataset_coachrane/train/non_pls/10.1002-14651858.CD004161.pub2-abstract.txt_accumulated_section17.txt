Background
Risperidone is the first new generation antipsychotic drug made available in a long‐acting injection formulation. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of depot risperidone for treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medication. 
To critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the resource use, cost and cost‐effectiveness of risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2002, 2012, and October 28, 2015). We also checked the references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. 
Main results
Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants were randomised to the following comparison treatments: 
Risperidone depot versus placebo 
Outcomes of relapse and improvement in mental state were neither measured or reported. In terms of other primary outcomes, more people receiving placebo left the study early by 12 weeks (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.74 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, very low quality evidence), experienced severe adverse events in short term (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.59 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93, very low quality evidence). There was however, no difference in levels of weight gain between groups (1 RCT, n=400, RR 2.11 95% CI 0.48 to 9.18, very low quality evidence). 
Risperidone depot versus general oral antipsychotics 
The outcome of improvement in mental state was not presented due to high levels of attrition, nor were levels of severe adverse events explicitly reported. Most primary outcomes of interest showed no difference between treatment groups. However, more people receiving depot risperidone experienced nervous system disorders (long‐term:1 RCT, n=369, RR 1.34 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58, very‐low quality evidence).
