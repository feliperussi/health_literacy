Background
Lactoferrin, a normal component of human colostrum and milk, can enhance host defenses and may be effective for prevention of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and effectiveness of lactoferrin supplementation to enteral feeds for prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm neonates. Secondarily, we assessed the effects of lactoferrin supplementation to enteral feeds on the duration of positive‐pressure ventilation, development of chronic lung disease (CLD) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), length of hospital stay to discharge among survivors, and adverse neurological outcomes at two years of age or later. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update our search. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 20 January 2020), PREMEDLINE (1996 to 20 January 2020), Embase (1980 to 20 January 2020), and CINAHL (1982 to 20 January 2020). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials. 
Selection criteria
In our search, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating enteral lactoferrin supplementation at any dose or duration to prevent sepsis or NEC in preterm neonates. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Meta‐analysis of data from twelve randomized controlled trials showed that lactoferrin supplementation to enteral feeds decreased suspected or confirmed late‐onset sepsis (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; typical RD ‐0.05, 95% CI, ‐0.07 to ‐0.02; NNTB 20, 95% CI 14 to 50; 12 studies, 5425 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and decreased length of hospital stay (MD ‐2.38 to 95% CI, ‐4.67 to ‐0.09; 3 studies, 1079 participants, low‐certainty evidence). A subgroup analysis including data of infants with confirmed sepsis demonstrates a decrease in confirmed late‐onset sepsis (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94; typical RD ‐0.03, 95% CI, ‐0.04 to ‐0.01; NNTB 33, 95% CI 25 to 100; 12 studies, 5425 participants, low‐certainty evidence).
