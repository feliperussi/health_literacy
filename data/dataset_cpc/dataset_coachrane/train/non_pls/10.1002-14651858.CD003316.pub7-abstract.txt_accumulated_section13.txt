Background
Levels of physical activity and physical fitness are low after stroke. Interventions to increase physical fitness could reduce mortality and reduce disability through increased function. 
Objectives
The primary objectives of this updated review were to determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, death or dependence, and disability. The secondary objectives were to determine the effects of training on adverse events, risk factors, physical fitness, mobility, physical function, health status and quality of life, mood, and cognitive function. 
Search methods
In July 2018 we searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, and four additional databases. We also searched ongoing trials registers and conference proceedings, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing either cardiorespiratory training or resistance training, or both (mixed training), with usual care, no intervention, or a non‐exercise intervention in stroke survivors. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed data using random‐effects meta‐analyses and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Diverse outcome measures limited the intended analyses. 
Main results
We included 75 studies, involving 3017 mostly ambulatory participants, which comprised cardiorespiratory (32 studies, 1631 participants), resistance (20 studies, 779 participants), and mixed training interventions (23 studies, 1207 participants). 
Death was not influenced by any intervention; risk differences were all 0.00 (low‐certainty evidence). There were few deaths overall (19/3017 at end of intervention and 19/1469 at end of follow‐up). None of the studies assessed death or dependence as a composite outcome. Disability scores were improved at end of intervention by cardiorespiratory training (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84; 8 studies, 462 participants; P = 0.002; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mixed training (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 9 studies, 604 participants; P = 0.02; low‐certainty evidence). There were too few data to assess the effects of resistance training on disability.
