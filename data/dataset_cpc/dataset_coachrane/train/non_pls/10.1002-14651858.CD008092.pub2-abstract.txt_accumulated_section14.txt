Background
Erosive lichen planus (ELP) affecting mucosal surfaces is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology. It is often more painful and debilitating than the non‐erosive types of lichen planus. Treatment of erosive lichen planus is difficult and aimed at palliation rather than cure. Several topical and systemic agents have been used with varying results. Another Cochrane review has already assessed interventions for lichen planus affecting the mouth. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions in the treatment of erosive lichen planus affecting the oral, anogenital, and oesophageal regions. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to September 2009: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of any topical or systemic interventions for ELP affecting either the mouth, genital region, or both areas, in participants of any age, gender, or race. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcome measures were as follows:
(a) Pain reduction using a visual analogue scale rated by participants;  (b) Physician Global Assessment; and (c) Participant global self‐assessment. 
Changes in scores at the end of therapy compared with baseline were analysed.
Main results
Fifteen RCTs were included, giving a total of 473 participants with ELP (study sizes ranged between 8‐94). All studies involved oral sites only. Six studies included participants with non‐erosive lichen planus but only the erosive subgroup was included for intended subgroup analysis. We were unable to pool data from any of the nine studies with only ELP participants or any of the six studies with the ELP subgroup, due to small numbers and the heterogeneity of the interventions, design methods, and outcome variables between studies.
