Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance that first presents and is recognised during pregnancy and usually resolves after the birth of the baby. GDM is associated with increased short‐ and long‐term morbidity for the mother and her baby. Treatment usually includes lifestyle modification and/or pharmacological therapy (oral antidiabetic agents or insulin) with the aim to maintain treatment targets for blood glucose concentrations. Finding novel treatment agents which are effective, acceptable and safe for the mother and her baby are important. One such emerging potential intervention is myo‐inositol which is an isomer of inositol and occurs endogenously and is found in natural dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and cereals. 
Objectives
To assess if dietary supplementation with myo‐inositol during pregnancy is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in treating gestational diabetes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (30 April 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 April 2016), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials or cluster‐randomised controlled trials reporting on the use of myo‐inositol compared with placebo, no treatment or another intervention for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes. Quasi‐randomised and cross‐over studies are not eligible for inclusion. Women with pre‐existing diabetes were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. For key outcomes (where data were available), we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included two studies (142 women and infants), both were conducted in women in Italy and compared myo‐inositol with a placebo control.
