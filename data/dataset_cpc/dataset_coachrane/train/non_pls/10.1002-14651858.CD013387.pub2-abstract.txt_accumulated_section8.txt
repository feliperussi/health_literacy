Background
Complete deletion of both the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q), known as 1p/19q codeletion, is a mutation that can occur in gliomas. It occurs in a type of glioma known as oligodendroglioma and its higher grade counterpart known as anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Detection of 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas is important because, together with another mutation in an enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase, it is needed to make the diagnosis of an oligodendroglioma. Presence of 1p/19q codeletion also informs patient prognosis and prediction of the best drug treatment. The main two tests in use are fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assays (also known as PCR‐based short tandem repeat or microsatellite analysis). Many other tests are available. None of the tests is perfect, although PCR‐based LOH is expected to have very high sensitivity. 
Objectives
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity and cost‐effectiveness of different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)‐based techniques for determining 1p/19q codeletion status in glioma. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and BIOSIS up to July 2019. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. We sought economic evaluation studies from the results of this search and using the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional studies in adults with glioma or any subtype of glioma, presenting raw data or cross‐tabulations of two or more DNA‐based tests for 1p/19q codeletion. We also sought economic evaluations of these tests.
