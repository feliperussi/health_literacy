Background
Sulpiride may be used in combination with other antipsychotic drugs in the hope of augmenting effectiveness – especially for those whose schizophrenia has proved resistant to treatment. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sulpiride augmentation versus monotherapy for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2009) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs).
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed‐effect model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
We included three short‐term and one long‐term trial (total N=221). All participants had schizophrenia that was either treatment‐resistant or with prominent negative symptoms. All studies compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine (+/‐ placebo), were small and at considerable risk of bias. 
Short‐term data of 'no clinically significant response' in global state tended to favour sulpiride augmentation of clozapine compared with clozapine alone (n=193, 3 RCTs, RR 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.09). 
People allocated to sulpiride plus clozapine had more movement disorders (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 48.24 CI 3.05 to 762.56) and an increase in serum prolactin (skewed data, 1 RCT), but less incidence of hypersalivation (n=162, 3 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.29 to 0.83) and less weight gain (n=64, 1 RCT, RR 0.30 CI 0.09 to 0.99). The augmentation of clozapine by sulpiride also caused less appetite loss (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.70, NNT 4 CI 4 to 12, Z=2.31, P=0.02) and less abdominal distension (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.10 CI 0.01 to 0.78, NNT 5 CI 4 to 19, Z=2.20, P=0.03). 
Long‐term data showed no significant difference in global state (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.42 to 1.08) and relapse (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.5 to 1.3).
