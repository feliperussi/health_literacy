We included seven studies from the literature search, but only six provided sufficient data for analyses. Included studies were European, cluster RCTs with adult participants seeing their usual doctor (in total 233 general practitioners and 1787 participants). Methodological quality was only moderate as studies had no blinding of healthcare professionals and several studies had a risk of recruitment and attrition bias. Studies were heterogeneous with regard to selection of patient populations and intensity of interventions. Outcomes relating to physical or general health (physical symptoms, quality of life) showed substantial heterogeneity between studies (I2 > 70%) and post hoc analysis suggested that benefit was confined to more intensive interventions; thus we did not calculate a pooled effect. Outcomes relating to mental health showed less heterogeneity and we conducted meta‐analyses, which found non‐significant overall effect sizes with SMDs for changes at 6 to 24 months follow‐up: mental health (3 studies) SMD ‐0.04 (95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.10), illness worry (3 studies) SMD 0.09 (95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.22), depression (4 studies) SMD 0.07 (95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.20) and anxiety (2 studies) SMD ‐0.07 (95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.25). Effects on sick leave could not be estimated. Three studies of patient satisfaction with care all showed positive but non‐significant effects, and measures were too heterogeneous to allow meta‐analysis. Results on healthcare utilisation were inconclusive. We analysed study discontinuation and found that both short term and long term discontinuation occurred more often in patients allocated to the intervention group, RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.46) at 12 to 24 months.
