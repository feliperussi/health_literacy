Background
In children with urinary tract infection (UTI), only those with pyelonephritis (and not cystitis) are at risk for developing long‐term renal sequelae. If non‐invasive biomarkers could accurately differentiate children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis, treatment and follow‐up could potentially be individualized. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. 
Objectives
The objectives of this review were to 1) determine whether procalcitonin (PCT), C‐reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can replace the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI; 2) assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests, and 3) compare the performance of the three tests to each other. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS Previews through to 17th December 2019 for this review. The reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were searched to identify additional studies not found through the electronic search. 
Selection criteria
We only considered published studies that evaluated the results of an index test (PCT, CRP, ESR) against the results of an acute‐phase 99Tc‐dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan (conducted within 30 days of the UTI) in children aged 0 to 18 years with a culture‐confirmed episode of UTI. The following cut‐off values were used for the primary analysis: 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 20 mg/L for CRP and 30 mm/hour for ESR. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the bivariate model to calculate pooled random‐effects pooled sensitivity and specificity values.
