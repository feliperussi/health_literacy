Background
The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti‐leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade‐off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is uncertain.  
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase‐based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution). 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi‐randomised, controlled clinical, cross‐over, and cluster‐randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre‐emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non‐randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion.
