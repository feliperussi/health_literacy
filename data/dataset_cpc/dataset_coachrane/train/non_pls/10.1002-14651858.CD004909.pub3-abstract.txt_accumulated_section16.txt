Background
Fetal movement counting is a method by which a woman quantifies the movements she feels to assess the condition of her baby. The purpose is to try to reduce perinatal mortality by alerting caregivers when the baby might be compromised. This method may be used routinely, or only in women who are considered at increased risk of complications affecting the baby. Fetal movement counting may allow the clinician to make appropriate interventions in good time to improve outcomes. On the other hand, fetal movement counting may cause unnecessary anxiety to pregnant women, or elicit unnecessary interventions. 
Objectives
To assess outcomes of pregnancy where fetal movement counting was done routinely, selectively or was not done at all; and to compare different methods of fetal movement counting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs where fetal movement counting was assessed as a method of monitoring fetal wellbeing. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for eligibility, assessed the methodological quality of included studies and independently extracted data from studies. Where possible the effects of interventions were compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For some outcomes, the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Five studies (71,458 women) were included in this review; 68,654 in one cluster‐RCT. None of these five trials were assessed as having low risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. All included studies except for one (which included high‐risk women as participants) included women with uncomplicated pregnancies.Two studies compared fetal movement counting with standard care, as defined by trial authors. Two included studies compared two types of fetal movement counting; once a day fetal movement counting (Cardiff count‐to‐10) with more than once a day fetal movement counting methods. One study compared fetal movement counting with hormone assessment. 
(1) Routine fetal movement counting versus mixed or undefined fetal movement counting 
No study reported on the primary outcome 'perinatal death or severe morbidity'. In one large cluster‐RCT, there was no difference in mean stillbirth rates per cluster (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 1.07; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, low quality evidence). The other study reported no fetal deaths. There was no difference in caesarean section rate between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.44; participants = 1076; studies = one,low quality evidence). Maternal anxiety was significantly reduced with routine fetal movement counting (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.10; participants = 1013; studies = one, moderate quality evidence). Maternal‐fetal attachment was not significantly different (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.11; participants = 951; studies = one, low quality evidence). In one study antenatal admission after reporting of decreased fetal movements was increased (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.52; participants = 123; studies = one). In another there was a trend to more antenatal admissions per cluster in the counting group than in the control group (SMD 0.38, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.93; participants = 52 clusters; studies = one, low quality evidence). Birthweight less than 10th centile was not significantly different between groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.44; participants = 1073; studies = one, low quality evidence). The evidence was of low quality due to imprecise results and because of concerns regarding unclear risk of bias. 
(2) Formal fetal movement counting (Modified Cardiff method) versus hormone analysis 
There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of caesarean section (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69; participants = 1191; studies = one). Women in the formal fetal movement counting group had significantly fewer hospital visits than those randomised to hormone analysis (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.35), whereas there were fewer Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes for women randomised to hormone analysis (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.93). No other outcomes reported showed statistically significant differences. 'Perinatal death or severe morbidity' was not reported.
