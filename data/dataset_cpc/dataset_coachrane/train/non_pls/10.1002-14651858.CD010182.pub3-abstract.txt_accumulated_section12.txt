Background
Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic, complex wound associated with considerable cost to patients and healthcare providers. To aid healing, primary wound contact dressings are usually applied to ulcers beneath compression devices. Alginate dressings are used frequently and there is a variety of alginate products on the market, however, the evidence base to guide dressing choice is sparse.  
Objectives
To determine the effects of alginate dressings compared with alternative dressings, non‐dressing treatments or no dressing, with or without concurrent compression therapy, on the healing of venous leg ulcers. 
Search methods
For this first update, in March 2015, we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any type of alginate dressing in the treatment of venous ulcers were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta‐analysis was undertaken when deemed feasible and appropriate. 
Main results
Five RCTs (295 participants) were included in this review. All were identified during the original review. The overall risk of bias was high for two RCTs and unclear for three. One RCT compared different proprietary alginate dressings (20 participants), three compared alginate and hydrocolloid dressings (215 participants), and one compared alginate and plain non‐adherent dressings (60 participants). Follow‐up periods were six weeks in three RCTs and 12 weeks in two. No statistically significant between‐group differences were detected for any comparison, for any healing outcome. Meta‐analysis was feasible for one comparison (alginate and hydrocolloid dressings), with data from two RCTs (84 participants) pooled for complete healing at six weeks: risk ratio 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.21). Adverse event profiles were generally similar between groups (not assessed for alginate versus plain non‐adherent dressings).
