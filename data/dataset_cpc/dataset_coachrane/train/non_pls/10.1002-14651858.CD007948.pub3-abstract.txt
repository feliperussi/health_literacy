Background
Blood for transfusion may become contaminated at any point between collection and transfusion and may result in bacteraemia (the presence of bacteria in the blood), severe illness or even death for the blood recipient. Donor arm skin is one potential source of blood contamination, so it is usual to cleanse the skin with an antiseptic before blood donation. One‐step and two‐step alcohol based antiseptic regimens are both commonly advocated but there is uncertainty as to which is most effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of cleansing the skin of blood donors with alcohol in a one‐step compared with alcohol in a two‐step procedure to prevent contamination of collected blood or bacteraemia in the recipient. 
Search methods
In December 2014, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. 
Selection criteria
All randomised trials (RCTs) comparing alcohol based donor skin cleansing in a one‐step versus a two‐step process that includes alcohol and any other antiseptic for pre‐venepuncture skin cleansing were considered. Quasi randomised trials were to have been considered in the absence of RCTs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion.
Main results
No studies (RCTs or quasi RCTs) met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We did not identify any eligible studies for inclusion in this review. It is therefore unclear whether a two‐step, alcohol followed by antiseptic skin cleansing process prior to blood donation confers any reduction in the risk of blood contamination or bacteraemia in blood recipients, or conversely whether a one‐step process increases risk above that associated with a two‐step process.
