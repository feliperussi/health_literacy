Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta‐analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD ‐2.00 mmHg; 95% CI ‐3.72 to ‐0.27) whilst the meta‐analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD ‐1.07 mmHg; 95% CI ‐3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD ‐7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI ‐22.6 to 6.62). Meta‐analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD ‐0.18; 95% CI ‐0.34 to ‐0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri‐procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.
