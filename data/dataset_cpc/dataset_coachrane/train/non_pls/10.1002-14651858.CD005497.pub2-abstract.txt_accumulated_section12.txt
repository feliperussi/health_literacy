Background
Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy when taken after unprotected intercourse. Obtaining emergency contraception within the recommended time frame is difficult for many women. Advance provision could circumvent some obstacles to timely use. 
Objectives
To summarize randomized controlled trials evaluating advance provision of emergency contraception to explore effects on pregnancy rates, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual and contraceptive behaviors. 
Search methods
In November 2009, we searched CENTRAL, EMBASE, POPLINE, MEDLINE via PubMed, and a specialized emergency contraception article database. We also searched reference lists and contacted experts to identify additional published or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing advance provision and standard access (i.e., counseling which may or may not have included information about emergency contraception, or provision of emergency contraception on request at a clinic or pharmacy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed study quality. We entered and analyzed data using RevMan 5.0.23. 
Main results
Eleven randomized controlled trials met our criteria for inclusion, representing 7695 patients in the United States, China, India and Sweden. Advance provision did not decrease pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25 in studies for which we included twelve‐month follow‐up data; OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.29 in a study with seven‐month follow‐up data; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.20 in studies for which we included six‐month follow‐up data; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74 in a study with three‐month follow‐up data), despite reported increased use (single use: OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.40; multiple use: OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.77 to 9.63) and faster use (weighted mean difference (WMD) ‐12.98 hours, 95% CI ‐16.66 to ‐9.31 hours). Advance provision did not lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.37), increased frequency of unprotected intercourse, or changes in contraceptive methods. Women who received emergency contraception in advance were equally likely to use condoms as other women.
