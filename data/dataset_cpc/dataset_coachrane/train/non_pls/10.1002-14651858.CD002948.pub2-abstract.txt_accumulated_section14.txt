Background
Herbal medicine interventions have been identified as having potential benefit in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Objectives
To update an existing systematic (Cochrane) review of herbal therapies in RA.
Search methods
We searched electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dissertation Abstracts (1996 to 2009), unrestricted by language, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in October 2010. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of herbal interventions compared with placebo or active controls in RA. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. 
Main results
Twelve new studies were added to the update, a total of 22 studies were included.
Evidence from seven studies indicate potential benefits of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil, in terms of reduced pain intensity (mean difference (MD) ‐32.83 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐56.25 to ‐9.42,100 point pain scale); improved disability (MD ‐15.75% 95% CI ‐27.06 to ‐4.44%); and an increase in adverse events (GLA 20% versus placebo 3%), that was not statistically different (relative risk 4.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 22.99). 
Three studies compared Tripterygium wilfordii (thunder god vine) to placebo and one to sulfasalazine and indicated improvements in some outcomes, but data could not be pooled due to differing interventions, comparisons and outcomes. One study reported serious side effects with oral Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. In the follow‐up studies, all side effects were mild to moderate and resolved after the intervention ceased. Two studies compared Phytodolor® N to placebo but poor reporting limited data extraction. The remaining studies each considered differing herbal interventions.
