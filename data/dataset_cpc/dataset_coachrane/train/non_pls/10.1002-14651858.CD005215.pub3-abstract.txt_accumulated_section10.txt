Background
Unintended pregnancy among adolescents represents an important public health challenge in high‐income countries, as well as middle‐ and low‐income countries. Numerous prevention strategies such as health education, skills‐building and improving accessibility to contraceptives have been employed by countries across the world, in an effort to address this problem. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effects of these interventions, hence the need to review the evidence‐base. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of primary prevention interventions (school‐based, community/home‐based, clinic‐based, and faith‐based) on unintended pregnancies among adolescents. 
Search methods
We searched all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status up to November 2015. We searched the Cochrane Fertility Regulation Group Specialised trial register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015 Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index, Dissertations Abstracts Online, The Gray Literature Network, HealthStar, PsycINFO, CINAHL and POPLINE and the reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
We included both individual and cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any interventions that aimed to increase knowledge and attitudes relating to risk of unintended pregnancies, promote delay in the initiation of sexual intercourse and encourage consistent use of birth control methods to reduce unintended pregnancies in adolescents aged 10 years to 19 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate, binary outcomes were pooled using a random‐effects model with a 95% confidence interval (Cl). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
