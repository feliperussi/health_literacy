Background
Prophylactic tocolysis with betamimetics and other agents has become widespread as a treatment for fetal distress. Uterine relaxation may improve placental blood flow and therefore, fetal oxygenation. However, there may also be adverse maternal cardiovascular effects. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of prophylactic betamimetic therapy during the second stage of labour on perinatal outcome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing prophylactic intravenous betamimetic therapy during the second stage of labour with placebo or no treatment in uncomplicated pregnancies. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors assessed trial quality independently and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We compared continuous data using mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs. 
Main results
One study involving 129 women and one including 35 women were included. Compared to placebo, prophylactic betamimetic therapy was associated with an increase in forceps deliveries in the first trial (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.29). Umbilical arterial pH values were higher in the tocolysis groups (two trials, 135 women; MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05). There were no clear effects on postpartum haemorrhage, Apgar scores at two minutes, neonatal irritability, or feeding slowness. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the prophylactic use of betamimetics during the second stage of labour. Future research should address the use of tocolysis for the management of fetal distress in the second stage of labour, avoiding the supine position.
