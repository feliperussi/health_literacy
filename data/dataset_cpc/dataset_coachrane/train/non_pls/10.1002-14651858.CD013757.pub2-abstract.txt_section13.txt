Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow‐up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow‐up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence).
