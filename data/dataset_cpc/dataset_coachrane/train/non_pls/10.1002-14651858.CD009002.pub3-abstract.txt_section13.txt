There was no evidence of a benefit from omega‐3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating ‐ Sum of Boxes (MD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega‐3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD ‐3.50, 95% CI ‐4.30 to ‐2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega‐3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment.
