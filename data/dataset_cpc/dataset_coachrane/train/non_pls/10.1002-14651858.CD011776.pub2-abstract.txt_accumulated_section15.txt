Background
Motor neuron disease (MND), which is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes a wide range of symptoms but the evidence base for the effectiveness of the symptomatic treatment therapies is limited. 
Objectives
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews of all symptomatic treatments for MND. 
Methods
We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on 15 November 2016 for systematic reviews of symptomatic treatments for MND. We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables. 
Main results
We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non‐RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. 
Drug therapy for pain 
There is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. 
Treatment for cramps 
There is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo: 
– memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate‐quality evidence); 
– vitamin E may have little or no effect (low‐quality evidence); and
– the effects of L‐threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.
