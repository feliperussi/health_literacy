Background
Nutritional support in the critically ill child has not been well investigated and is a controversial topic within paediatric intensive care. There are no clear guidelines as to the best form or timing of nutrition in critically ill infants and children. This is an update of a review that was originally published in 2009. . 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the impact of enteral and parenteral nutrition given in the first week of illness on clinically important outcomes in critically ill children. There were two primary hypotheses: 
1. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally or parenterally is different to that of children who are given no nutrition; 2. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally is different to that of children fed parenterally. 
We planned to conduct subgroup analyses, pending available data, to examine whether the treatment effect was altered by: 
a. age (infants less than one year versus children greater than or equal to one year old); b. type of patient (medical, where purpose of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is for medical illness (without surgical intervention immediately prior to admission), versus surgical, where purpose of admission to ICU is for postoperative care or care after trauma). 
We also proposed the following secondary hypotheses (a priori), pending other clinical trials becoming available, to examine nutrition more distinctly: 
3. the mortality rate is different in children who are given enteral nutrition alone versus enteral and parenteral combined; 4. the mortality rate is different in children who are given both enteral feeds and parenteral nutrition versus no nutrition.
