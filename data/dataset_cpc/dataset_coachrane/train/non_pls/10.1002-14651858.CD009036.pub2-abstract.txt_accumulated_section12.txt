Background
Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV‐1) or 2 (HSV‐2). Some infected people experience outbreaks of genital herpes, typically, characterized by vesicular and erosive localized painful genital lesions. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of three oral antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir) prescribed to suppress genital herpes outbreaks in non‐pregnant patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and pharmaceutical company databases up to February 2014. We also searched US Food and Drug Administration databases and proceedings of seven congresses to a maximum of 10 years. We contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
We selected parallel‐group and cross‐over randomized controlled trials including patients with recurrent genital herpes caused by HSV, whatever the type (HSV‐1, HSV‐2, or undetermined), with at least four recurrences per year (trials concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐positive patients or pregnant women were not eligible) and comparing suppressive oral antiviral treatment with oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir versus placebo or another suppressive oral antiviral treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected eligible trials and extracted data. The Risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias. Treatment effect was measured by the risk ratio (RR) of having at least one genital herpes recurrence. Pooled RRs were derived by conventional pairwise meta‐analyses. A network meta‐analysis allowed for estimation of all possible two‐by‐two comparisons between antiviral drugs. 
Main results
A total of 26 trials (among which six had a cross‐over design) were included. Among the 6950 randomly assigned participants, 54% (range 0 to100%) were female, mean age was 35 years (range 26 to 45.1), and the mean number of recurrences per year was 11 (range 6.3 to 17.8). Duration of treatment was two to 12 months. Risk of bias was considered high for half of the studies and unclear for the other half. A total of 14 trials compared acyclovir versus placebo, four trials compared valacyclovir versus placebo and 2 trials compared valacyclovir versus no treatment. Three trials compared famciclovir versus placebo. Two trials compared valacyclovir versus famciclovir and one trial compared acyclovir versus valacyclovir versus placebo.
