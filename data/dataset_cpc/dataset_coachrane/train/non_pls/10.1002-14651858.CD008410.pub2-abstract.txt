Background
Evidence on the benefits of admission tests other than cardiotocography in preventing adverse perinatal outcomes has not been established. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of admission tests other than cardiotocography in preventing adverse perinatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised (individual and cluster) controlled trials, comparing labour admission tests other than CTG for the prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, quality and extracted data.
Main results
We included one study involving 883 women.
Comparison of sonographic assessment of amniotic fluid index (AFI) on admission versus no sonographic assessment of AFI on admission. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress in the intervention group (29 of 447) was significantly higher than those of controls (14 of 436) (risk ratio (RR) 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.77). 
The incidence of Apgar score less than seven at five minutes in the intervention group (10 of 447) was not significantly different from controls (seven of 436) (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.63). 
The incidence of artificial oxytocin for augmentation of labour in the intervention group (213 of 447) was significantly higher than controls (132 of 436) (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.87). 
The incidence of neonatal NICU admission in the intervention group (35 of 447) was not significantly different from the controls (33 of 436) (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63) 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support the use of admission tests other than cardiotocography for fetal assessment during labour. Appropriate randomised controlled trials with adequate sample size of admission tests other than cardiotocography for fetal assessment during labour are required.
