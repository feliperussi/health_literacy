We included 12 trials, representing 1650 participants. Baseline phases ranged from four to 12 weeks and double‐blind phases ranged from 11 to 19 weeks. The RR for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency with add‐on topiramate compared to placebo was 2.71 (95% CI 2.05 to 3.59; 12 studies; high‐certainty evidence). Dose regression analysis showed increasing effect with increasing topiramate dose demonstrated by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.45 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.64; P < 0.001) per 200 mg/d increase in topiramate dosage. The proportion of participants achieving seizure freedom was also significantly increased with add‐on topiramate compared to placebo (RR 3.67, 95% CI 1.79 to 7.54; 8 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Treatment withdrawal was significantly higher for add‐on topiramate compared to placebo (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.37; 12 studies; high‐certainty evidence). The RRs for the following adverse effects indicate that they are significantly more prevalent with topiramate, compared to placebo: ataxia 2.29 (99% CI 1.10 to 4.77; 4 studies); concentration difficulties 7.81 (99% CI 2.08 to 29.29; 6 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); dizziness 1.52 (99% CI 1.07 to 2.16; 8 studies); fatigue 2.08 (99% CI 1.37 to 3.15; 10 studies); paraesthesia 3.65 (99% CI 1.58 to 8.39; 7 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); somnolence 2.44 (99% CI 1.61 to 3.68; 9 studies); 'thinking abnormally' 5.70 (99% CI 2.26 to 14.38; 4 studies; high‐certainty evidence); and weight loss 3.99 (99% CI 1.82 to 8.72; 9 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence of publication bias for the primary outcome was found (Egger test, P = 0.001). We rated all studies included in the review as having either low or unclear risk of bias. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate to high certainty due to the evidence of publication bias, statistical heterogeneity and imprecision, which was partially compensated for by large effect sizes.
