Background
Hirschsprung‐associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a leading cause of serious morbidity and potential mortality in children with Hirschsprung's disease (HD). People with HAEC suffer from intestinal inflammation, and present with diarrhoea, explosive stools, and abdominal distension. Probiotics are live microorganisms with beneficial health effects, which can optimise gastrointestinal function and gut flora. However, the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation in the prevention of HAEC remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of probiotic supplements used either alone or in combination with pharmacological interventions on the prevention of Hirschsprung‐associated enterocolitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, the China BioMedical Literature database (CBM), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and Clinical Trials Registry‐India, from database inception to 27 February 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews for any additional trails. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics and placebo, or any other non‐probiotic intervention, for the prevention of HAEC were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies; disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included two RCTs, with a total of 122 participants. We judged the overall risk of bias as high. We downgraded the evidence due to risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding) and small sample size.
