Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that causes progressive symptoms of breathlessness, cough and mucus build‐up. It is the fourth or fifth most common cause of death worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. 
Inhaled long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABAs) are widely prescribed to manage the symptoms of COPD when short‐acting agents alone are no longer sufficient. Twice‐daily treatment with an inhaled LABA is aimed at relieving symptoms, improving exercise tolerance and quality of life, slowing decline and even improving lung function and preventing and treating exacerbations. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of twice‐daily long‐acting beta2‐agonists compared with placebo for patients with COPD on the basis of clinically important endpoints, primarily quality of life and COPD exacerbations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers' websites in June 2013. 
Selection criteria
Parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting populations of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies were required to be at least 12 weeks in duration and designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a long‐acting beta2‐agonist against placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Data and characteristics were extracted independently by two review authors, and each study was assessed for potential sources of bias. Data for all outcomes were pooled and subgrouped by LABA agent (formoterol 12 μg, formoterol 24 μg and salmeterol 50 μg) and then were separately analysed by LABA agent and subgrouped by trial duration. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the proportion of participants taking inhaled corticosteroids and for studies with high or uneven rates of attrition.
