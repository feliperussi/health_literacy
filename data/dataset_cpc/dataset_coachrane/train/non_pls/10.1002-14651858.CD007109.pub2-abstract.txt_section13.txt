There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (318 participants in fewer‐than‐four‐ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 316 participants in four‐port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group). The proportion of participants with serious adverse events was low in both treatment groups and the estimated RR was compatible with a reduction and substantial increased risk with the fewer‐than‐four‐ports group (6/318 (1.9%)) and four‐port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (0/316 (0%)) (RR 3.93; 95% CI 0.86 to 18.04; 7 trials; 634 participants; very low quality evidence). The estimated difference in the quality of life (measured between 10 and 30 days) was imprecise (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.18; 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.42; 4 trials; 510 participants; very low quality evidence), as was the proportion of participants in whom the laparoscopic cholecystectomy had to be converted to open cholecystectomy between the groups (fewer‐than‐four ports 3/289 (adjusted proportion 1.2%) versus four port: 5/292 (1.7%); RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.35; 5 trials; 581 participants; very low quality evidence). The fewer‐than‐four‐ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy took 14 minutes longer to complete (MD 14.44 minutes; 95% CI 5.95 to 22.93; 9 trials; 855 participants; very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in hospital stay between the groups (MD ‐0.01 days; 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.26; 6 trials; 731 participants) or in the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 1 trial; 50 participants; very low quality evidence) between the two groups. The times taken to return to normal activity and work were shorter by two days in the fewer‐than‐four‐ports group compared with four‐port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (return to normal activity: MD ‐1.20 days; 95% CI ‐1.58 to ‐0.81; 2 trials; 325 participants; very low quality evidence; return to work: MD ‐2.00 days; 95% CI ‐3.31 to ‐0.69; 1 trial; 150 participants; very low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in cosmesis scores at 6 to 12 months between the two groups (SMD 0.37; 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.84; 2 trials; 317 participants; very low quality evidence).
