Background
Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high rates of mortality and life‐threatening complications. Continuous veno‐venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been used in some centers to reduce mortality and avoid local or systemic complications; however, its efficacy and safety are uncertain. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of CVVH in patients suffering from severe acute pancreatitis; to compare the effects of different CVVH techniques; and to evaluate the optimal time for delivery of CVVH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (2019, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to 13 September 2019), Embase (1974 to 13 September 2019), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1982 to 13 September 2019). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CVVH versus no CVVH in participants with severe acute pancreatitis. We also included RCTs that compared different types of CVVH and different schedules for CVVH in participants with severe acute pancreatitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed the meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, involving a total of 219 adults with severe acute pancreatitis with various etiologies, including alcoholic abuse, biliary disease, high‐fat diet, hyperlipidemia, etc. All of the participants had single or multiple organ failure. All of the RCTs were single‐center studies conducted in China. The mean age of participants was 47.4 years. The mean proportion of females was 42.0%. All RCTs were at high risk of bias.
