Background
Radical surgery has been standard treatment for patients with early vulvar cancer since the mid 1900s. Survival figures are excellent, but complication rates are high. Since 1980, surgery has become more individualised in order to decrease complications in patients with limited disease. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of individualised treatment with that of standard extensive surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (to April 2007). We also searched our own publication archives, based on prospective handsearching of six leading relevant journals from December 1986. Reference lists of identified studies, gynaecological cancer handbooks and conference abstracts were also scanned. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case controlled and observational studies on the effectiveness of surgery (local surgery and regional lymph node dissection) on patients with cT1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. 
Outcome measures were overall, disease‐specific, disease‐free survival (DFS), treatment complications, quality of life (QoL). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors (AA, JVD, MS) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. 
Main results
From three studies, we concluded there was no difference in the incidence of: 1. local recurrent vulvar cancer between radical local excision and radical vulvectomy, or 2. groin recurrence between ipsilateral groin node dissection and bilateral groin node dissection in patients with a well lateralised tumour. 
Furthermore, superficial groin node dissection is not as safe as full femoro‐inguinal lymph node dissection. The triple incision technique is a safe procedure provided tumour free margins are greater than 8 mm and the slight increase in recurrences does not outweigh the reduction in complications.
