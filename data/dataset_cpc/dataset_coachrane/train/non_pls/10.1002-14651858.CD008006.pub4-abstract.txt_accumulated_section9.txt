Background
This is an updated version of a Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2013 in the Cochrane Library. In many clinical areas, integrated care pathways are utilised as structured multidisciplinary care plans that detail essential steps in caring for patients with specific clinical problems. In particular, care pathways for the dying have been developed as a model to improve care of patients who are in the last days of life. The care pathways were designed with an aim of ensuring that the most appropriate management occurs at the most appropriate time, and that it is provided by the most appropriate health professional. Since the last update, there have been sustained concerns about the safety of implementing end‐of‐life care pathways, particularly in the United Kingdom (UK). Therefore, there is a significant need for clinicians and policy makers to be informed about the effects of end‐of‐life care pathways via a systematic review. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of end‐of‐life care pathways, compared with usual care (no pathway) or with care guided by another end‐of‐life care pathway across all healthcare settings (e.g. hospitals, residential aged care facilities, community). 
In particular, we aimed to assess the effects on symptom severity and quality of life of people who are dying, or those related to the care, such as families, carers and health professionals, or a combination of these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, review articles, trial registries and reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted the original search in September 2009, and the second updated search in July 2015. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised trials or high quality controlled before‐and‐after studies comparing use versus non‐use of an end‐of‐life care pathway in caring for the dying.
