There was no evidence of a difference following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stenting compared to primary stenting (PS) in technical success rates in either the study involving stenotic lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.99; 279 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving iliac artery occlusions (OR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.90; 112 participants; low certainty evidence). In one trial, PTA of iliac artery occlusions resulted in a higher rate of major complications, especially distal embolisation (OR 4.50 95% CI 1.18 to 17.14; 1 study, 112 participants; low certainty evidence). Immediate complications were similar in the second study (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.13; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence). Neither study reported on delayed complications. No evidence of a difference was seen in symptomatic improvement (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.27; 1 study, 157 participants; low certainty evidence). The second study did not provide data but reported no differences. For the outcome of patency, no evidence of a difference was seen in the study involving iliac occlusion at two years (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.44; 1 study, 57 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving stenotic lesions at two years (71.3% in the PS group versus 69.9% in the PTA group). Only one study reported on reintervention (six to eight years, OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.23; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence); and resolution of symptoms and signs (12 months, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.00; 1 study, 219 participants; low certainty evidence), with no evidence of a difference detected in either outcome. Neither study reported on improvement in walking distance as reported by the patient.
