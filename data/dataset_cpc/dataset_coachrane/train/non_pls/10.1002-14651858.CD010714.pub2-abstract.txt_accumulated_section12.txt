Background
Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract. In paediatric clinical practice, it is usually a complaint of children attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as ulcers, gastric or oesophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory‐Weiss tears, anorectal fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch‐Schonlein purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum; it also occurs with high incidence in critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by stress‐induced gastropathy. No matter what the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children. 
Search methods
We searched EBM Reviews ‐ the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May 2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and Wanfang Data to the medical field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs in children with gastrointestinal bleeding that compared fasting with feeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the literature search results, and there were no disagreements. 
Main results
We identified no RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that compared the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding. No study fulfilled the criteria for considering studies for our review.
