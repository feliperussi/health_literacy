Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients. Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks). Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG, one study was a three‐armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG with usual care and one study was a three‐armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group. Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators. Meta‐analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA1c at up to six months follow‐up (‐0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.4 to ‐0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non‐significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow‐up (‐0.1; 95% CI ‐0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials). Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well‐being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well‐being or general health‐related quality of life. Two trials reported costs of self‐monitoring: One trial compared the costs of self‐monitoring of blood glucose with self‐monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self‐monitoring in 1990. Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self‐monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self‐monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self‐monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were £89 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), £181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self‐monitoring group and £173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self‐monitoring group. Higher losses to follow‐up in the more intensive self‐monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self‐monitoring group.
