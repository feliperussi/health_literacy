Background
Urinary incontinence is a very common and debilitating problem affecting about 50% of women at some point in their lives. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a predominant cause in 30% to 80% of these women imposing significant health and economic burden on society and the women affected. Mid‐urethral sling (MUS) operations are a recognised minimally invasive surgical treatment for SUI. MUS involves the passage of a small strip of tape through either the retropubic or obturator space, with entry or exit points at the lower abdomen or groin, respectively. This review does not include single‐incision slings. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effects of mid‐urethral sling (MUS) operations for the treatment of SUI, urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) in women. 
Search methods
We searched: Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (including: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov) (searched 26 June 2014); Embase Classic (January 1947 to Week 25 2014); WHO ICTRP (searched 30 June 2014); reference lists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials amongst women with SUI, USI or MUI, in which both trial arms involve a MUS operation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible studies and extracted data from included trials. 
Main results
We included 81 trials that evaluated 12,113 women. We assessed the quality of evidence for outcomes using the GRADE assessment tool; the quality of most outcomes was moderate, mainly due to risk of bias or imprecision. 
Fifty‐five trials with data contributed by 8652 women compared the use of the transobturator route (TOR) and retropubic route (RPR). There is moderate quality evidence that in the short term (up to one year) the rate of subjective cure of TOR and RPR are similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00; 36 trials, 5514 women; moderate quality evidence) ranging from 62% to 98% in the TOR group, and from 71% to 97% in the RPR group. Short‐term objective cure was similar in the TOR and RPR groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.00; 40 trials, 6145 women). Fewer trials reported medium‐term (one to five years) and longer‐term (over five years) data, but subjective cure was similar between the groups (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; 5 trials, 683 women; low quality evidence; and RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12; 4 trials, 714 women; moderate quality evidence, respectively). In the long term, subjective cure rates ranged from 43% to 92% in the TOR group, and from 51% to 88% in the RPR group.
