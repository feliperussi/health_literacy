The review now includes 36 trials with 3542 participants, comparing CBT with a range of other psychosocial therapies that we classified as either active (A) (n = 14) or non active (NA) (n = 14). Trials were often small and at high or unclear risk of bias. When CBT was compared with other psychosocial therapies, no difference in long‐term relapse was observed (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 375; studies = 5, low‐quality evidence). Clinically important change in global state data were not available but data for rehospitalisation were reported. Results showed no clear difference in long term rehospitalisation (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.14; participants = 943; studies = 8, low‐quality evidence) nor in long term mental state (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; participants = 249; studies = 4, low‐quality evidence). No long‐term differences were observed for death (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.98; participants = 627; studies = 6, low‐quality evidence). Only average endpoint scale scores were available for social functioning and quality of life. Social functioning scores were similar between groups (long term Social Functioning Scale (SFS): MD 8.80, 95% CI ‐4.07 to 21.67; participants = 65; studies = 1, very low‐quality evidence), and quality of life scores were also similar (medium term Modular System for Quality of Life (MSQOL): MD ‐4.50, 95% CI ‐15.66 to 6.66; participants = 64; studies = 1, very low‐quality evidence). There was a modest but clear difference favouring CBT for satisfaction with treatment ‐ measured as leaving the study early (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; participants = 2392; studies = 26, low quality evidence).
