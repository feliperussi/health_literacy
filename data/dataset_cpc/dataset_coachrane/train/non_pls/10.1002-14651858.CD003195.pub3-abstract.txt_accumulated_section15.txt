Background
Urodynamic tests are used to investigate people who have urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms in order to make a definitive, objective diagnosis. The aim is to help select the treatment most likely to be successful. The investigations are invasive and time consuming. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine if treatment according to a urodynamic‐based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of people with urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes. 
The intention was to test the following hypotheses in predefined subgroups of people with incontinence: (i) urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes; 
(ii) urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making;
(iii) one type of urodynamic test is better than another in improving the outcomes of management of incontinence or influencing clinical decisions, or both. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 19 February 2013), and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes in groups of people who were and were not investigated using urodynamics, or comparing one type of urodynamic test against another were included. Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
Main results
Eight trials involving around 1100 people were included but data were only available for 1036 women in seven trials, of whom 526 received urodynamics. There was some evidence of risk of bias. The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained.
