For the infant, there was no evidence of a clear difference between those whose mothers had been treated with insulin and those treated with oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapies for the risk of being born large‐for‐gestational age (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; 13 studies, 2352 infants; moderate‐quality evidence); the risk of perinatal (fetal and neonatal death) mortality (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.49; 10 studies, 1463 infants; low‐quality evidence);, for the risk of death or serious morbidity composite (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; two studies, 760 infants; moderate‐quality evidence); the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 24 studies, 3892 infants; low‐quality evidence); neonatal adiposity at birth (% fat mass) (mean difference (MD) 1.6%, 95% CI ‐3.77 to 0.57; one study, 82 infants; moderate‐quality evidence); neonatal adiposity at birth (skinfold sum/mm) (MD 0.8 mm, 95% CI ‐2.33 to 0.73; random‐effects; one study, 82 infants; very low‐quality evidence); or childhood adiposity (total percentage fat mass) (MD 0.5%; 95% CI ‐0.49 to 1.49; one study, 318 children; low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence also found no clear differences between groups for rates of neurosensory disabilities in later childhood: hearing impairment (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.49; one study, 93 children), visual impairment (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.90; one study, 93 children), or any mild developmental delay (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.44; one study, 93 children). Later infant mortality, and childhood diabetes were not reported as outcomes in the included studies.
