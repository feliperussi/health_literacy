Background
Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, in the epithelial lining and lining fluids of the lung may be beneficial in the reduction of oxidative damage (Arab 2002). They may therefore be of benefit in reducing symptoms of inflammatory airway conditions such as asthma, and may also be beneficial in reducing exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction, which is a well‐recognised feature of asthma and is considered a marker of airways inflammation. However, the association between dietary antioxidants and asthma severity or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction is not fully understood. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of vitamin C supplementation on exacerbations and health‐related quality of life (HRQL) in adults and children with asthma or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction compared to placebo or no vitamin C. 
Search methods
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR). The Register contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of a number of bibliographic databases, and handsearching of journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched trial registry websites. The searches were conducted in December 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included both adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma. In separate analyses we considered trials with a diagnosis of exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction (or exercise‐induced asthma). We included trials comparing vitamin C supplementation with placebo, or vitamin C supplementation with no supplementation. We included trials where the asthma management of both treatment and control groups provided similar background therapy. The primary focus of the review is on daily vitamin C supplementation to prevent exacerbations and improve HRQL. The short‐term use of vitamin C at the time of exacerbations or for cold symptoms in people with asthma are outside the scope of this review.
