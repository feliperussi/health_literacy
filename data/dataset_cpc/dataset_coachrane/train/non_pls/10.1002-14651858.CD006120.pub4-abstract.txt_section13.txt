Most comparisons were restricted to single trial analyses and were under‐powered to detect differences in pain scores between treatments that may or may not have been present. There was no difference in pain relief between women who received local anaesthetic infiltration (lignocaine 2%; administered as a paracervical or direct cervical injection) and a saline placebo (mean difference (MD) ‐13.74; 95% CI ‐34.32 to 6.83; 2 trials; 130 women; low quality evidence). However, when local anaesthetic was combined with a vasoconstrictor agent (one trial used lignocaine plus adrenaline while the second trial used prilocaine plus felypressin), there was less pain (on visual analogue scale (VAS)) compared with no treatment (MD ‐23.73; 95% CI ‐37.53 to ‐9.93; 2 trials; 95 women; low quality evidence). Comparing two preparations of local anaesthetic combined with vasoconstrictor, prilocaine plus felypressin did not differ from lignocaine plus adrenaline for its effect on pain control (MD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.16; 1 trial; 200 women). Although the mean (± standard deviation (SD)) observed blood loss score was less with lignocaine plus adrenaline (1.33 ± 1.05) compared with prilocaine plus felypressin (1.74 ± 0.98), the difference was not clinically as the overall scores in both groups were low (MD 0.41; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69; 1 trial; 200 women). Inhalation of gas mixture (isoflurane and desflurane) in addition to standard cervical injection with prilocaine plus felypressin resulted in less pain during the LLETZ (loop excision of the transformation zone) procedure (MD ‐7.20; 95% CI ‐12.45 to ‐1.95; 1 trial; 389 women). Lignocaine plus ornipressin resulted in less measured blood loss (MD ‐8.75 ml; 95% CI ‐10.43 to ‐7.07; 1 trial; 100 women) and a shorter duration of treatment (MD ‐7.72 minutes; 95% CI ‐8.49 to ‐6.95; 1 trial; 100 women) than cervical infiltration with lignocaine alone. Buffered solution (sodium bicarbonate buffer mixed with lignocaine plus adrenaline) was not superior to non‐buffered solution of lignocaine plus adrenaline in relieving pain during the procedure (MD ‐8.00; 95% CI ‐17.57 to 1.57; 1 trial; 52 women).
