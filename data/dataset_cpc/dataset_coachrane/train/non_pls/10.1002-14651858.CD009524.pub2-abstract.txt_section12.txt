Seven trials involving a total of 1697 participants were found and six were included in the quantitative analyses. No data were available from the seventh trial. Three trials involving 1243 patients were included in analyses of efficacy outcomes, and four trials involving 1034 patients were included in analyses of safety and tolerability outcomes. We judged five trials to be at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting and three to be at high risk of attrition bias. There was low quality evidence favouring latrepirdine on the Clinician's Interview ‐ Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input after 26 weeks (CIBIC‐Plus) (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.31, 1 study, P < 0.001). Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether latrepirdine had any effect on cognition measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐3.47 to 0.49, 3 studies, P = 0.14) or the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) (MD 0.59, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 2.11, 3 studies, P = 0.45), or on function measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease Co‐operative Study ‐ Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS‐ADL) (MD 1.00, 95% CI ‐1.15 to 3.15, 3 studies, P = 0.36) at study endpoint (26 or 52 weeks). We considered the evidence provided on these outcomes to be of overall low quality. However, there was some high quality evidence showing a very small benefit of latrepirdine on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (MD ‐1.77, 95% CI ‐3.09 to ‐0.45, 3 studies, P = 0.009) at study endpoint (26 or 52 weeks). Additionally, moderate quality evidence suggested that latrepirdine and placebo were comparable in adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, P = 0.51), serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35, P = 0.52), dropouts (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.27, P = 0.57) and dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.67, P = 0.93).
