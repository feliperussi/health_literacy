Background
Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Despite the long‐standing use of intra‐articular corticosteroids, there is an ongoing debate about their benefits and safety. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of intra‐articular corticosteroids compared with sham or no intervention in people with knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to 3 February 2015), checked trial registers, conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted authors. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared intra‐articular corticosteroids with sham injection or no treatment in people with knee osteoarthritis. We applied no language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pain, function, quality of life, joint space narrowing, and risk ratios (RRs) for safety outcomes. We combined trials using an inverse‐variance random‐effects meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We identified 27 trials (13 new studies) with 1767 participants in this update. We graded the quality of the evidence as 'low' for all outcomes because treatment effect estimates were inconsistent with great variation across trials, pooled estimates were imprecise and did not rule out relevant or irrelevant clinical effects, and because most trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Intra‐articular corticosteroids appeared to be more beneficial in pain reduction than control interventions (SMD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.58 to ‐0.22), which corresponds to a difference in pain scores of 1.0 cm on a 10‐cm visual analogue scale between corticosteroids and sham injection and translates into a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). An I2 statistic of 68% indicated considerable between‐trial heterogeneity. A visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested some asymmetry (asymmetry coefficient ‐1.21, 95%CI ‐3.58 to 1.17). When stratifying results according to length of follow‐up, benefits were moderate at 1 to 2 weeks after end of treatment (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.27), small to moderate at 4 to 6 weeks (SMD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.21), small at 13 weeks (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.00), and no evidence of an effect at 26 weeks (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.11). An I2 statistic of ≥ 63% indicated a moderate to large degree of between‐trial heterogeneity up to 13 weeks after end of treatment (P for heterogeneity≤0.001), and an I2 of 0% indicated low heterogeneity at 26 weeks (P=0.43). There was evidence of lower treatment effects in trials that randomised on average at least 50 participants per group (P=0.05) or at least 100 participants per group (P=0.013), in trials that used concomittant viscosupplementation (P=0.08), and in trials that used concomitant joint lavage (P≤0.001).
