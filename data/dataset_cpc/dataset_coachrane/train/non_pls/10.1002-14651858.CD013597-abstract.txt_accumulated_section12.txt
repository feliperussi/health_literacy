Background
Handwashing is important to reduce the spread and transmission of infectious disease. Ash, the residue from stoves and fires, is a material used for cleaning hands in settings where soap is not widely available. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning using soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections. 
Search methods
On 26 March 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria
We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias, which another review author double‐checked. We used the ROBINS‐I tool for observational studies, we used RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesise data with random‐effects meta‐analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence. 
Main results
We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomised trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low‐ and lower‐middle‐income countries. Six studies reported outcome data relevant to our review.
