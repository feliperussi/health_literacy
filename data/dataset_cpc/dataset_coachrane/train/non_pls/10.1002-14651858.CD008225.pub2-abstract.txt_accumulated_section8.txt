Background
Early‐onset child conduct problems are common and costly. A large number of studies and some previous reviews have focused on behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural group‐based parenting interventions, but methodological limitations are commonplace and evidence for the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of these programmes has been unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural group‐based parenting programmes for improving child conduct problems, parental mental health and parenting skills. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases between 23 and 31 January 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to current), EMBASE (1980 to current), CINAHL (1982 to current), PsycINFO (1872 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1956 to current), ASSIA (1987 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to current), Academic Search Premier (1970 to current), Econlit (1969 to current), PEDE (1980 to current), Dissertations and Theses Abstracts (1980 to present), NHS EED (searched 31 January 2011), HEED (searched 31 January 2011), DARE (searched 31 January 2011), HTA (searched 31 January 2011), mRCT (searched 29 January 2011). We searched the following parent training websites on 31 January 2011: Triple P Library, Incredible Years Library and Parent Management Training. We also searched the reference lists of studies and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if: (1) they involved randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of behavioural and cognitive‐behavioural group‐based parenting interventions for parents of children aged 3 to 12 years with conduct problems, and (2) incorporated an intervention group versus a waiting list, no treatment or standard treatment control group. We only included studies that used at least one standardised instrument to measure child conduct problems.
