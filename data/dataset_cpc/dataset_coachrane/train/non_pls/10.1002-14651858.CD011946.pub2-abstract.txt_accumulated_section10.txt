Background
Acne scarring is a frequent complication of acne and resulting scars may negatively impact on an affected person's psychosocial and physical well‐being. Although a wide range of interventions have been proposed, there is a lack of high‐quality evidence on treatments for acne scars to better inform patients and their healthcare providers about the most effective and safe methods of managing this condition. This review aimed to examine treatments for atrophic and hypertrophic acne scars, but we have concentrated on facial atrophic scarring. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for treating acne scars.
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to November 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which allocated participants (whether split‐face or parallel arms) to any active intervention (or a combination) for treating acne scars. We excluded studies dealing only or mostly with keloid scars. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently extracted data from each of the studies included in this review and evaluated the risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and arbitration supported by a method expert as required. Our primary outcomes were participant‐reported scar improvement and any adverse effects serious enough to cause participants to withdraw from the study.
