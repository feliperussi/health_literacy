Background
Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in people with Down Syndrome (DS). Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Rivastigmine is a “pseudo‐irreversible” inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is thought to maintain levels of acetylcholine. Rivastigmine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. This review was superseded by a new review titled 'Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome' in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in 2015. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine for people with DS who develop AD. 
Search methods
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of rivastigmine as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered compared with a placebo group. 
Data collection and analysis
No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review.
Main results
No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
As there are no included trials, recommendations cannot be made about rivastigmine for AD in DS. Well‐designed, adequately powered studies are required.
