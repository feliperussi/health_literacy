Auto‐CPAP probably reduces daytime sleepiness compared with fixed CPAP at about six weeks by a small amount (MD ‐0.44 ESS units, 95% CI ‐0.72 to ‐0.16; 25 studies, 1285 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). AHI is slightly higher with auto‐CPAP than with fixed CPAP (MD 0.48 events per hour, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.80; 26 studies, 1256 participants; high‐certainty evidence), although it fell with both machine types from baseline values in the studies. Ten per cent of people in auto‐CPAP and 11% in the fixed CPAP arms withdrew from the studies (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.27; moderate‐certainty evidence). Auto‐CPAP and fixed CPAP may have similar effects on quality of life, as measured by the FOSQ but more evidence is needed to be confident in this result (MD 0.12, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.46; 3 studies, 352 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies (353 participants) provided data on clinic‐measured blood pressure. Auto‐CPAP may be slightly less effective at reducing diastolic blood pressure compared to fixed CPAP (MD 2.92 mmHg, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.77 mmHg; low‐certainty evidence). The two modalities of CPAP probably do not differ in their effects on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.87 mmHg, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 4.82; moderate‐certainty evidence). Nine studies (574 participants) provided information on adverse events such as nasal blockage, dry mouth, tolerance of treatment pressure and mask leak. They used different scales to capture these outcomes and due to variation in the direction and size of effect between the studies, the comparative effects on tolerability outcomes are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence).
