Rates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between study groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I² = 0%, moderate‐quality evidence). When we considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 73%, moderate‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the study groups in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 0%) or a need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women). Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (MD ‐0.32 days, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.03, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I² = 52%, moderate‐quality evidence) and faster onset of flatus (MD ‐0.21 days, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I² = 23%, moderate‐quality evidence). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD ‐1.47 days, 95% CI ‐2.26 to ‐0.68, P = 0.0003, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 92%, moderate‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD ‐0.25 days, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I² = 0%, moderate‐quality evidence). Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD ‐0.92 days, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.31, P = 0.003, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 68%, moderate‐quality evidence). Infectious complications were less common in the early feeding group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02, 2 RCTs, 183 women, I² = 0%, high‐quality evidence). In one study, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P < 0.00001, 143 women, moderate‐quality evidence).
