Background
Different bone‐modifying agents like bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL)‐inhibitors are used as supportive treatment in men with prostate cancer and bone metastases to prevent skeletal‐related events (SREs). SREs such as pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery and radiotherapy to the bone, and hypercalcemia lead to morbidity, a poor performance status, and impaired quality of life. Efficacy and acceptability of the bone‐targeted therapy is therefore of high relevance. Until now recommendations in guidelines on which bone‐modifying agents should be used are rare and inconsistent. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and RANKL‐inhibitors as supportive treatment for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and to generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to their safety and efficacy using network meta‐analysis. 
Search methods
We identified studies by electronically searching the bibliographic databases Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase until 23 March 2020. We searched the Cochrane Library and various trial registries and screened abstracts of conference proceedings and reference lists of identified trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing different bisphosphonates and RANKL‐inihibitors with each other or against no further treatment or placebo for men with prostate cancer and bone metastases. We included men with castration‐restrictive and castration‐sensitive prostate cancer and conducted subgroup analyses according to this criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We defined proportion of participants with pain response and the adverse events renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were SREs in total and each separately (see above), mortality, quality of life, and further adverse events such as grade 3 to 4 adverse events, hypocalcemia, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. We conducted network meta‐analysis and generated treatment rankings for all outcomes, except quality of life due to insufficient reporting on this outcome. We compiled ranking plots to compare single outcomes of efficacy against outcomes of acceptability of the bone‐modifying agents. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Twenty‐five trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Twenty‐one trials could be considered in the quantitative analysis, of which six bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, risedronate, pamidronate, alendronate, etidronate, or clodronate) were compared with each other, the RANKL‐inhibitor denosumab, or no treatment/placebo. By conducting network meta‐analysis we were able to compare all of these reported agents directly and/or indirectly within the network for each outcome. In the abstract only the comparisons of zoledronic acid and denosumab against the main comparator (no treatment/placebo) are described for outcomes that were predefined as most relevant and that also appear in the 'Summary of findings' table. Other results, as well as results of subgroup analyses regarding castration status of participants, are displayed in the Results section of the full text.
