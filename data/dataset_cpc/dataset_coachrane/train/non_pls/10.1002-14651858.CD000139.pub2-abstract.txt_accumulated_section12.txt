Background
Weaning and extubating preterm infants on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for respiratory failure may be difficult. A significant contributing factor is thought to be the relatively poor respiratory drive and tendency to develop hypercarbia and apnoea, particularly in very preterm infants. Methylxanthine treatment started before extubation might stimulate breathing and increase the chances of successful weaning from IPPV. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of prophylactic methylxanthine treatment on the use of intubation and IPPV and other clinically important side effects in preterm infants being weaned from IPPV and in whom endotracheal extubation is planned. 
Search methods
The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2010), the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to July 2010), CINAHL (1982 to July 2010) and EMBASE (1988 to July 2010). 
Selection criteria
All published trials utilising random or quasi‐random patient allocation in which treatment with methylxanthines (theophylline or caffeine) was compared with placebo or no treatment to improve the chances of successful extubation of preterm or low birth weight infants were included. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. 
Main results
Seven studies were identified for inclusion. Methylxanthine treatment results in a reduction in failure of extubation within one week (summary RR 0.48, 95%CI 0.32 to 0.71; summary RD ‐0.27, 95%CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.15; NNT 4, 95%CI 3 to 7; six trials, 172 infants). There is significant heterogeneity in the RD meta‐analysis perhaps related to the large variation in baseline rate in the control groups (range 20 to 100%).
