Background
Age‐related cataract accounts for more than 40% of cases of blindness in the world with the majority of people who are blind from cataract living in lower income countries. With the increased number of people with cataract, it is important to review the evidence on the effectiveness of day care cataract surgery. 
Objectives
To provide authoritative, reliable evidence regarding the safety, feasibility, effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of day case cataract extraction by comparing clinical outcomes, cost‐effectiveness, patient satisfaction or a combination of these in cataract operations performed in day care versus in‐patient units. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing day care and in‐patient surgery for age‐related cataract. The primary outcome was the achievement of a satisfactory visual acuity six weeks after the operation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.
