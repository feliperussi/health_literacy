Glycaemic control (as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) showed improvement following culturally appropriate health education at three months (mean difference (MD) ‐0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.5 to ‐0.2); 14 trials; 1442 participants; high‐quality evidence) and at six months (MD ‐0.5% (95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.4); 14 trials; 1972 participants; high‐quality evidence) post intervention compared with control groups who received 'usual care'. This control was sustained to a lesser extent at 12 months (MD ‐0.2% (95% CI ‐0.3 to ‐0.04); 9 trials; 1936 participants) and at 24 months (MD ‐0.3% (95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.1); 4 trials; 2268 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) post intervention. Neutral effects on health‐related quality of life measures were noted and there was a general lack of reporting of adverse events in most studies — the other two primary outcomes for this review. Knowledge scores showed improvement in the intervention group at three (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.4 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6), six (SMD 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7)) and 12 months (SMD 0.4 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6)) post intervention. A reduction in triglycerides of 24 mg/dL (95% CI ‐40 to ‐8) was observed at three months, but this was not sustained at six or 12 months. Neutral effects on total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were reported at any follow‐up point. Other outcome measures (blood pressure, body mass index, self‐efficacy and empowerment) also showed neutral effects compared with control groups. Data on the secondary outcomes of diabetic complications, mortality and health economics were lacking or were insufficient.
