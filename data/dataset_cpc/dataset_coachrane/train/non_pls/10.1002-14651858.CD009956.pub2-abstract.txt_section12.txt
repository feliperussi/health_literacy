Forty‐five trials, studying 69 exercise interventions, were eligible for this review, including 2250 people with MS. The prescribed exercise interventions were categorised as endurance training (23 interventions), muscle power training (nine interventions), task‐oriented training (five interventions), mixed training (15 interventions), or 'other' (e.g. yoga; 17 interventions). Thirty‐six included trials (1603 participants) provided sufficient data on the outcome of fatigue for meta‐analysis. In general, exercise interventions were studied in mostly participants with the relapsing‐remitting MS phenotype, and with an Expanded Disability Status Scale less than 6.0. Based on 26 trials that used a non‐exercise control, we found a significant effect on fatigue in favour of exercise therapy (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.73 to ‐0.33; P value < 0.01). However, there was significant heterogeneity between trials (I2 > 58%). The mean methodological quality, as well as the combined body of evidence, was moderate. When considering the different types of exercise therapy, we found a significant effect on fatigue in favour of exercise therapy compared to no exercise for endurance training (SMDfixed effect ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.69 to ‐0.17; P value < 0.01), mixed training (SMDrandom effect ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.23 to ‐0.23; P value < 0.01), and 'other' training (SMDfixed effect ‐0.54, 95% CI ‐0.79 to ‐0.29; P value < 0.01). Across all studies, one fall was reported. Given the number of MS relapses reported for the exercise condition (N = 25) and non‐exercise control condition (N = 26), exercise does not seem to be associated with a significant risk of a MS relapse. However, in general, MS relapses were defined and reported poorly.
