We included 38 studies. Based on three studies, acupuncture was not shown to be more effective than a waiting list control for long‐term abstinence, with wide confidence intervals and evidence of heterogeneity (n = 393, risk ratio [RR] 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 3.28, I² = 57%). Compared with sham acupuncture, the RR for the short‐term effect of acupuncture was 1.22 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.38), and for the long‐term effect was 1.10 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.40). The studies were not judged to be free from bias, and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry with larger studies showing smaller effects. The heterogeneity between studies was not explained by the technique used. Acupuncture was less effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). There was no evidence that acupuncture is superior to psychological interventions in the short‐ or long‐term. There is limited evidence that acupressure is superior to sham acupressure for short‐term outcomes (3 trials, n = 325, RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.08), but no trials reported long‐term effects, The pooled estimate for studies testing an intervention that included continuous auricular stimulation suggested a short‐term benefit compared to sham stimulation (14 trials, n = 1155, RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.16); subgroup analysis showed an effect for continuous acupressure (7 studies, n = 496, RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.78 to 4.18) but not acupuncture with indwelling needles (6 studies, n = 659, RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.69). At longer follow‐up the CIs did not exclude no effect (5 trials, n = 570, RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.74). The evidence from two trials using laser stimulation was inconsistent and could not be combined. The combined evidence on electrostimulation suggests it is not superior to sham electrostimulation (short‐term abstinence: 6 trials, n = 634, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.46; long‐term abstinence: 2 trials, n = 405, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23).
