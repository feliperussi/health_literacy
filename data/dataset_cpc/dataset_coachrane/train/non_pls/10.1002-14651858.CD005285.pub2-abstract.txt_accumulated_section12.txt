Background
Children, like adults, are required to fast before general anaesthesia with the aim of reducing the volume and acidity of their stomach contents. It is thought that fasting reduces the risk of regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents during surgery. Recent developments have encouraged a shift from the standard 'nil‐by‐mouth‐from‐midnight' fasting policy to more relaxed regimens. Practice has been slow to change due to questions relating to the duration of a total fast, the type and amount of intake permitted. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effects of different fasting regimens (duration, type and volume of permitted intake) and the impact on perioperative complications and patient well being (aspiration, regurgitation, related morbidity, thirst, hunger, pain, comfort, behaviour, nausea and vomiting) in children. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 25/6/09), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2009), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to June Week 2 2009), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2009 Week 25), EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to June Week 3 2009), the National Research Register, relevant conference proceedings and article reference lists and contacted experts. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials of preoperative fasting regimens for children were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction and trial quality assessment was conducted independently by three authors. Trial authors were contacted for additional information including adverse events. 
Main results
This first update of the review identified two additional eligible studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 25 (forty seven randomised controlled comparisons involving 2543 children considered to be at normal risk of regurgitation or aspiration during anaesthesia). Only one incidence of aspiration and regurgitation was reported.
