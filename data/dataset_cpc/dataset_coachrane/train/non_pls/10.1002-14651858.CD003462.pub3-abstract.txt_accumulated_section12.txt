Background
Non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) represent a spectrum of disease including unstable angina and non‐ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Despite treatment with aspirin, beta‐blockers and nitroglycerin, unstable angina/NSTEMI is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although evidence suggests that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more efficacious compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), there is limited data to support the role of heparins as a drug class in the treatment of NSTEACS. This is an update of a review last published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of heparins (UFH and LMWH) compared with placebo for the treatment of patients with non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or NSTEMI). 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Heart Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to January week 1 2014), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 2014 week 02), CINAHL (1937 to 15 January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to 15 January 2014). We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of parenteral UFH or LMWH versus placebo in people with non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or NSTEMI). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality of studies and independently extracted data. 
Main results
There were no new included studies for this update. Eight studies (3118 participants) were included in this review. We found no evidence for difference in overall mortality between the groups treated with heparin and placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.98). Heparins compared with placebo, reduced the occurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63, number needed to benefit (NNTB) = 33). There was a trend towards more major bleeds in the heparin studies compared to control studies (RR = 2.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.60). From a limited data set, there appeared to be no difference between patients treated with heparins compared to control in the occurrence of thrombocytopenia (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.24). Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as most of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.
