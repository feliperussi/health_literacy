Background
Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive inherited haemoglobinopathy which causes painful vaso‐occlusive crises due to sickle red blood cell dehydration. Vaso‐occlusive crises are common painful events responsible for a variety of clinical complications; overall mortality is increased and life expectancy decreased compared to the general population. Experimental studies suggest that intravenous magnesium has proven to be well‐tolerated in individuals hospitalised for the immediate relief of acute (sudden onset) painful crisis and has the potential to decrease the length of hospital stay. Some in vitro studies and open studies of long‐term oral magnesium showed promising effect on pain relief but failed to show its efficacy. The studies show that oral magnesium therapy may prevent sickle red blood cell dehydration and prevent recurrent painful episodes. There is a need to access evidence for the impact of oral and intravenous magnesium effect on frequency of pain, length of hospital stay and quality of life. This is an updated version of the review. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of short‐term intravenous magnesium on the length of hospital stay and quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. To determine the effects of long‐term oral magnesium therapy on the frequency of painful crises and the quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. 
Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 03 February 2019. 
Date of last search of other resources (clinical trials registries): 04 April 2019.
Selection criteria
We searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled studies of oral or intravenous magnesium compared to placebo or no magnesium. 
Data collection and analysis
Authors independently assessed the study quality and extracted the data using standard Cochrane methodologies. 
Main results
We included five randomized placebo‐controlled studies with a total of 386 participants (aged three to 53 years). Of these, two shorter parallel studies (n = 306) compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo (normal saline) for admission to hospital due to a vaso‐occlusive crisis, for which we were able to analyse data. The quality of evidence was moderate for studies in this comparison, mainly due to limitations due to risk of bias and imprecision. Two of the three longer‐term studies comparing oral magnesium pidolate to placebo had a cross‐over design. The third was a parallel factorial study which compared hydroxyurea and oral magnesium to each other and to placebo over a longer period of time; we only present the comparison of oral magnesium to placebo from this study. The quality of evidence was very low with uncertainty of the estimation.
