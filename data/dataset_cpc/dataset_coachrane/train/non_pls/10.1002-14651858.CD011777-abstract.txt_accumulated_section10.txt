Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury) is common, often repeated, and strongly associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review on psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for deliberate SH, first published in 1998 and previously updated in 1999. We have now divided the review into three separate reviews. This review is focused on pharmacological interventions in adults who self harm. 
Objectives
To identify all randomised controlled trials of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH in adults, and to conduct meta‐analyses (where possible) to compare the effects of specific treatments with comparison types of treatment (e.g., placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment) for SH patients. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the CCDAN Specialised Register (September 2014). Additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were conducted to October 2013. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatments or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. Meta‐analysis was only possible for one intervention (i.e. newer generation antidepressants) on repetition of SH at last follow‐up. For this analysis, we pooled data using a random‐effects model. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach.
