Most of the trials assessed HBIG 100 IU (two trials) and HBIG 200 IU (31 trials). The timing of administration of HBIG varied; 30 trials administered three doses of HBIG 200 IU at 28, 32, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. None of the trials reported all‐cause mortality or other serious adverse events in the mothers or babies. Serological signs of hepatitis B infection of the newborns were reported as HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV‐DNA positive results at end of follow‐up. Twenty‐nine trials reported HBsAg status in newborns (median 1.2 months of follow‐up after birth; range 0 to 12 months); seven trials reported HBeAg status (median 1.1 months of follow‐up after birth; range 0 to 12 months); and 16 trials reported HBV‐DNA status (median 1.2 months of follow‐up; range 0 to 12 months). HBIG reduced mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HBsAg when compared with no intervention (179/2769 (6%) with HBIG versus 537/2541 (21%) with no intervention; RR 0.30, TSA‐adjusted CI 0.20 to 0.52; I2 = 36%; 29 trials; 5310 participants; very low quality evidence). HBV‐DNA reduced MTCT of HBsAg (104/1112 (9%) with HBV‐DNA versus 382/1018 (38%) with no intervention; RR 0.25, TSA‐adjusted CI 0.22 to 0.27; I2 = 84%; 16 trials; 2130 participants; low quality evidence). TSA supported both results. Meta‐analysis showed that maternal HBIG did not decrease HBeAg in newborns compared with no intervention (184/889 (21%) with HBIG versus 232/875 (27%) with no intervention; RR 0.68, TSA‐adjusted CI 0.04 to 6.37; I2 = 90%; 7 trials; 1764 participants; very low quality evidence). TSA could neither support nor refute this observation as data were too sparse. None of the trials reported adverse events of the immunoglobulins on the newborns, presence of local and systemic adverse events on the mothers, or cost‐effectiveness of treatment.
