Ten trials (717 participants) evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures (66% were three‐ or four‐part fractures). There is high‐certainty evidence of no clinically important difference between surgical and non‐surgical treatment in patient‐reported shoulder function at one year (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.07 to 0.27; 7 studies, 552 participants) and two years (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.25; 5 studies, 423 participants). There is moderate‐certainty evidence of no clinically important between‐group difference in patient‐reported shoulder function at six months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.38; 3 studies, 347 participants). There is high‐certainty evidence of no clinically important between‐group difference in quality of life at one year (EQ‐5D (0: dead to 1: best quality): mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.04; 6 studies, 502 participants). There is low‐certainty evidence of little between‐group difference in mortality: one of the 31 deaths was explicitly linked with surgery (risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.62; 8 studies, 646 participants). There is low‐certainty evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.51; 9 studies, 667 participants). Based on an illustrative risk of 35 subsequent operations per 1000 non‐surgically‐treated patients, this indicates an extra 38 subsequent operations per 1000 surgically‐treated patients (95% CI 8 to 94 more). Although there was low‐certainty evidence of a higher overall risk of adverse events after surgery, the 95% CI also includes a slightly increased risk of adverse events after non‐surgical treatment (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.31; 3 studies, 391 participants).
