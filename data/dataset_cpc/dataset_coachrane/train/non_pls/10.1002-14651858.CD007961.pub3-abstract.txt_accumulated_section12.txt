Background
This is a updated version of our Cochrane Review published in Issue 6, 2012. Sexually‐transmitted infections (STIs) continue to rise worldwide, imposing an enormous morbidity and mortality burden. Effective prevention strategies, including microbicides, are needed to achieve the goals of the World Heath Organization (WHO) global strategy for the prevention and control of these infections. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of topical microbicides for preventing acquisition of STIs, including HIV. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CLIB, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and reference lists of relevant articles up to August 2020. In addition, we contacted relevant organisations and experts. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of vaginal microbicides compared to placebo (except for nonoxynol‐9 because it is covered in related Cochrane Reviews). Eligible participants were sexually‐active non‐pregnant, WSM and MSM, who had no laboratory confirmed STIs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias in duplicate, resolving differences by consensus. We conducted a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, stratified by type of microbicide, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included eight trials from the earlier version of the review and four new trials, i.e. a total of 12 trials with 32,464 participants (all WSM). We did not find any eligible study that enrolled MSM or reported fungal STI as an outcome. We have no study awaiting assessment.
