Background
Caesarean section is the commonest major operation performed on women worldwide. Operative techniques, including abdominal incisions, vary. Some of these techniques have been evaluated through randomised trials. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and risks of alternative methods of abdominal surgical incisions for caesarean section. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of intention to perform caesarean section using different abdominal incisions. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from the sources, checked them for accuracy and analysed the data.
Main results
Four studies (666 women) were included in this review.
Two studies (411 women) compared the Joel‐Cohen incision with the Pfannenstiel incision. Overall, there was a 65% reduction in reported postoperative febrile morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.87) with the Joel‐Cohen incision. One of the trials reported reduced postoperative analgesic requirements (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76); operating time (mean difference (MD) ‐11.40, 95% CI ‐16.55 to ‐6.25 minutes); delivery time (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐2.53 to ‐1.27 minutes); total dose of analgesia in the first 24 hours (MD ‐0.89, 95% CI ‐1.19 to ‐0.59); estimated blood loss (MD ‐58.00, 95% CI ‐108.51 to ‐7.49 mL); postoperative hospital stay for the mother (MD ‐1.50, 95% CI ‐2.16 to ‐0.84 days); and increased time to the first dose of analgesia (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.48 hours) compared with the Pfannenstiel group. No other significant differences were found in either trial.
