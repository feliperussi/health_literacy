Background
Policy makers, health staff and communities recognise that health services in lower‐ and middle‐income countries need to improve people's access to HIV treatment and retention to treatment programmes. One strategy is to move antiretroviral delivery from hospitals to more peripheral health facilities or even beyond health facilities. This could increase the number of people with access to care, improve health outcomes, and enhance retention in treatment programmes. On the other hand, providing care at less sophisticated levels in the health service or at community‐level may decrease quality of care and result in worse health outcomes. To address these uncertainties, we summarised the research studies examining the risks and benefits of decentralising antiretroviral therapy service delivery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of various models that decentralised HIV treatment and care to more basic levels in the health system for initiating and maintaining antiretroviral therapy. 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive search to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress) from 1 January 1996 to 31 March 2013, and contacted relevant organisations and researchers. The search terms included 'decentralisation', 'down referral', 'delivery of health care', and 'health services accessibility'. 
Selection criteria
Our inclusion criteria were controlled trials (randomised and non‐randomised), controlled‐before and after studies, and cohorts (prospective and retrospective) in which HIV‐infected people were either initiated on antiretroviral therapy or maintained on therapy in a decentralised setting in lower‐ and middle‐income countries. We define decentralisation as providing treatment at a more basic level in the health system to the comparator.
