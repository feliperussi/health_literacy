Despite the fact that 7110 people participated in fifteen randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. Study attrition was very large and data reporting poor. Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short and medium term (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n=2271, 8 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.5 to 0.97, NNT 26 CI 16 to 239). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below that expected from placebo (n=305, 1 RCT, RR 0.32 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 14 CI 11 to 50). Compared with typical antipsychotics there were no significant benefits for aripiprazole with regards to global state, mental state, quality of life or leaving the study early. Both groups reported similar rates of adverse effects, with the exception of akathisia (n= 955 RR 0.31 CI 0.2 to 0.6, NNT 20 CI 17 to 32) and the need for antiparkinson medication (n=1854, 4 RCTs, RR 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 4 CI 3 to 5) which were lower in those receiving aripiprazole. When compared with olanzapine and risperidone, aripiprazole was no better or worse on outcomes of global state and leaving the study early. The rates of adverse effects were also similar, with the exception of less elevation of prolactin (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 0.04 CI 0.02 to 0.1, NNT 2 CI 1 to 2.5) and less prolongation of the average QTc (30 mg/day) (n=200, 1 RCT, WMD ‐10.0, CI ‐16.99 to ‐3.0) compared with risperidone. When compared with standard care (mixed group receiving typical and atypical antipsychotics) one aripiprazole study did have significantly less people not responding to treatment (n=1599, RR 0.70 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6 ), not satisfied with care (n=1599, RR 0.62 CI 0.6 to 0.7, NNT 4 CI 4 to 5) and less people leaving the study early (n=1599, 1 RCT, RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 13 CI 8 to 39). Results from the five new papers identified from the updated review search, did not significantly alter the main results or conclusions of the original review.
