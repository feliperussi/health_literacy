Background
Ocular herpes is a viral infection of the eye caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), a double‐stranded DNA virus. Corneal scarring caused by herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is the leading infectious cause of penetrating corneal graft in high‐income countries. Acyclovir is an antiviral drug known to have a protective effect against recurrences in herpetic eye disease. While there are some studies which have evaluated the effects of intervention with oral antiviral in preventing such recurrences in people with corneal grafts, a systematic review of all comparative clinical trials has not been previously undertaken. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of oral antivirals such as acyclovir in any dosage when taken for six months or more, in preventing recurrence of herpetic keratitis in people having corneal graft surgery for herpetic keratitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 June 2016. We handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors of the included studies and researchers active in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). People enrolled in these trials had corneal grafts for HSK. The intervention was oral antivirals for six months or more following the corneal graft surgery, and this was compared to no treatment or placebo.
