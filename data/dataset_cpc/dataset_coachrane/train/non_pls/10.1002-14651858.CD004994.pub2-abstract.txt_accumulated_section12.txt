Background
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti‐hepatitis' drug, used in China for chronic hepatitis C. Until now, systematic reviews on bicyclol therapy have not been performed. 
Objectives
To study the benefits and harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis C.
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1994 to July 2005), EMBASE (1994 to July 2005), Science Citation Index Expanded (1994 to July 2005), The Chinese Biomedical Database (1994 to August 2005), Chinese Journals Full‐article Database (1994 to August 2005), VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (1994 to August 2005), and China National Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to August 2005). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials on bicyclol versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with chronic hepatitis C were included, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcome measures were total and liver‐related mortality and liver‐related morbidity (eg, cirrhosis and carcinoma). Secondary outcome measures were viral response and liver histology. 
Main results
The search identified one randomised clinical trial comparing bicyclol with placebo for 39 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The follow‐up was three months. In the trial, there was no evidence that bicyclol was superior to placebo for clearance of HCV RNA (RR 3.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 31.0) and anti‐HCV antibodies, but bicyclol was associated with statistically significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase activity at 12‐th week after treatment (WMD ‐69 IU/L, 95% CI ‐115 to ‐24).
