Background
Several factors may influence the progression of normal labour. It has been postulated that the routine administration of intravenous fluids to keep women adequately hydrated during labour may reduce the period of contraction and relaxation of the uterine muscle, and may ultimately reduce the duration of the labour. It has also been suggested that intravenous fluids may reduce caesarean sections (CS) for prolonged labour.  
However, the routine administration of intravenous fluids to labouring women has not been adequately elucidated although it is a widely‐adopted policy, and there is no consensus on the type or volume of fluids that are required, or indeed, whether intravenous fluids are at all necessary. Women may be able to adequately hydrate themselves if they were allowed oral fluids during labour. 
Furthermore, excessive volumes of intravenous fluids may pose risks to both the mother and her newborn and different fluids are associated with different risks. 
Objectives
To evaluate whether the routine administration of intravenous fluids to low‐risk nulliparous labouring women reduces the duration of labour and to evaluate the safety of intravenous fluids on maternal and neonatal health. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of intravenous fluid administration to spontaneously labouring low‐risk nulliparous women. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and extracted data. 
Main results
We included nine randomised trials with 1781 women. Three trials had more than two treatment arms and were included in more than one comparison.
