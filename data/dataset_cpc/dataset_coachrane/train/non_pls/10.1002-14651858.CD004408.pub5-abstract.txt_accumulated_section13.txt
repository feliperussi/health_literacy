Background
It is controversial whether compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI) reduces health service use, or improves clinical outcome and social functioning. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness of compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (2003, 2008, 2012, 8 November 2013, 3 June 2016). We obtained all references of identified studies and contacted authors where necessary. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of CCT compared with standard care for people with SMI (mainly schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders, bipolar disorder, or depression with psychotic features). Standard care could be voluntary treatment in the community or another pre‐existing form of CCT such as supervised discharge. 
Data collection and analysis
Authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data. We used Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. For binary outcomes, we calculated a fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and, where possible, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a fixed‐effect mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI. We used the GRADE approach to create 'Summary of findings' tables for key outcomes and assessed the risk of bias of these findings. 
Main results
The review included three studies (n = 749). Two were based in the USA and one in England. The English study had the least bias, meeting three out of the seven criteria of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. The two other studies met only one criterion, the majority being rated unclear. 
Two trials from the USA (n = 416) compared court‐ordered 'outpatient commitment' (OPC) with entirely voluntary community treatment. There were no significant differences between OPC and voluntary treatment by 11 to 12 months in any of the main health service or participant level outcome indices: service use ‐ readmission to hospital (2 RCTs, n= 416, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.21, low‐quality evidence); service use ‐ compliance with medication (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19, low‐quality evidence); social functioning ‐ arrested at least once (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.52, low‐quality evidence); social functioning ‐ homelessness (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.15, low‐quality evidence); or satisfaction with care ‐ perceived coercion (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.89, low‐quality evidence). However, one trial found the risk of victimisation decreased with OPC (1 RCT, n = 264, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.80, low‐quality evidence).
