Background
Recently, sex hormones such as estrogens and testosterone or its derivatives have been the focus of interest for treatment of persistent symptoms associated with schizophrenia. 
Objectives
To review the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/testosterone as adjunctive therapy to standard antipsychotic drugs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2007).
Selection criteria
We included all clinical randomised trials comparing DHEA/testosterone plus standard antipsychotic treatment with standard treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention to treat basis, using a fixed effects model. We presented continuous data using the weighted mean difference statistic, with a 95% confidence interval using a fixed effects model. 
Main results
We found three relevant small, short trials (total n=126). Clinical Global Impression data were equivocal (n=27, 1 RCT, WMD ‐0.43 CI ‐0.9 to 0.1). Average total PANSS scores were not significantly different between the DHEA plus antipsychotic group and those given antipsychotic drugs and placebo (n=82, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐4.16 CI ‐13.8 to 5.5). PANSS positive scores were equivocal (n=55, 1 RCT, WMD ‐1.00 CI ‐3.8 to 1.8). For negative symptoms binary SANS scale data favoured the DHEA plus antipsychotic group (n=30, 1 RCT, RR 0.23 CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNT 2 CI 2 to 3) but PANSS negative scores were not significantly different between comparison groups (n=55, 1 RCT, WMD ‐2.30 CI ‐6.4 to 1.8). About 17% of people left both groups early (n=64, 2 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.3 to 2.4). St Hans Rating Scale data for extrapyramidal symptoms favoured the DHEA plus antipsychotic group (n=30, 1 RCT, WMD ‐5.00 CI ‐8.8 to ‐1.2) but akathisia ratings were equivocal (n=34, 1 RCT, RR 2.67 CI 0.3 to 23.1). Ratings of parkinsonian movement disorder differed within the same trial depending of the outcome scale used. Quality of life seemed unaffected by use of DHEA (n=55, 1 RCT, WMD 6.20 CI ‐1.4 to 13.8).
