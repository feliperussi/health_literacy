Background
People living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a range of symptoms and often have complex comorbidities. Many pharmacological interventions for people with CKD have known risks of adverse events. Acupuncture is widely used for symptom management in patients with chronic diseases and in other palliative care settings. However, the safety and efficacy of acupuncture for people with CKD remains largely unknown. 
Objectives
We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of acupuncture, electro‐acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion and other acupuncture‐related interventions (alone or combined with other acupuncture‐related interventions) for symptoms of CKD. In particular, we planned to compare acupuncture and related interventions with conventional medicine, active non‐pharmacological interventions, and routine care for symptoms of CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 28 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched Korean medical databases (including Korean Studies Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Centre for Health Database, KoreaMed, the National Assembly Library) and Chinese databases (including the China Academic Journal). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that investigated the effects of acupuncture and related point‐stimulation interventions with or without needle penetration that involved six sessions or more in adults with CKD stage 3 to 5, regardless of the language and type of publication. We excluded studies that used herbal medicine or co‐interventions administered unequally among the study groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Primary outcomes were changes in pain and depression, and occurrence of serious of adverse events. 
Main results
We included 24 studies that involved a total of 1787 participants. Studies reported on various types of acupuncture and related interventions including manual acupuncture and acupressure, ear acupressure, transcutaneous electrical acupuncture point stimulation, far‐infrared radiation on acupuncture points and indirect moxibustion. CKD stages included pre‐dialysis stage 3 or 4 and end‐stage kidney disease on either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 
None of the included studies assessed pain outcomes, nor formally addressed occurrence of serious adverse events, although three studies reported three participant deaths and three hospitalisations as reasons for attrition. Three studies reported minor acupuncture‐related harms; the remainder did not report if those events occurred.
