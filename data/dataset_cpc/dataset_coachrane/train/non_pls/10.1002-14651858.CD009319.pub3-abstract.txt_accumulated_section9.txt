Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2013, Issue 4. 
Low‐grade gliomas (LGG) constitute a class of slow‐growing primary brain neoplasms. Patients with clinically and radiographically suspected LGG have two initial surgical options, biopsy or resection. Biopsy can provide a histological diagnosis with minimal risk but does not offer a direct treatment. Resection may have additional benefits such as increasing survival and delaying recurrence, but is associated with a higher risk for surgical morbidity. There remains controversy about the role of biopsy versus resection and the relative clinical outcomes for the management of LGG. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness of biopsy compared to surgical resection in patients with a new lesion suspected to be a LGG. 
Search methods
The following electronic databases were searched in 2012 for the first version of the review: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3 2012), Embase (1980 to Week 46 2012). For this updated version, the following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE (Nov 2012 to June week 3 2016), Embase (Nov 2012 to 2016 week 26). All relevant articles were identified on PubMed and by using the ’related articles’ feature. We also searched unpublished and grey literature including ISRCTN‐metaRegister of Controled Trials, Physicians Data Query and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include patients of any age with a suspected intracranial LGG receiving biopsy or resection within a randomized clinical trial (RCT) or controlled clinical trial (CCT). Patients with prior resections, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy for LGG were excluded. Outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS), functionally independent survival (FIS), adverse events, symptom control, and quality of life (QoL).
