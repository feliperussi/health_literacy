We included seven studies (1684 participants) in the review. One study enrolled participants from a residential care facility, and the other six studies from primary care and outpatient clinics. All‐cause hospital admission data was available in four studies (556 participants). Participants in the NLT group experienced a lower rate of all‐cause hospital admissions (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88, high‐quality evidence) and fewer hospital admissions related to heart failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, moderate‐quality evidence) compared to the usual‐care group. Six studies (902 participants) examined all‐cause mortality. All‐cause mortality was also lower in the NLT group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92, moderate‐quality evidence) compared to usual care. Approximately 27 deaths could be avoided for every 1000 people receiving NLT of beta‐adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs. Only three studies (370 participants) reported outcomes on all‐cause and heart failure‐related event‐free survival. Participants in the NLT group were more likely to remain event free compared to participants in the usual‐care group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, moderate‐quality evidence). Five studies (966 participants) reported on the number of participants reaching target dose of beta‐adrenergic blocking agents. This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low‐quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta‐adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care. Two studies reported on adverse events; one of these studies stated there were no adverse events, and the other study found one adverse event but did not specify the type or severity of the adverse event.
