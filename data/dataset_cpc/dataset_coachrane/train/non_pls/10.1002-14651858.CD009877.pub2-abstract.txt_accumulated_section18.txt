Background
Computer users frequently complain about problems with seeing and functioning of the eyes. Asthenopia is a term generally used to describe symptoms related to (prolonged) use of the eyes like ocular fatigue, headache, pain or aching around the eyes, and burning and itchiness of the eyelids. The prevalence of asthenopia during or after work on a computer ranges from 46.3% to 68.5%. Uncorrected or under‐corrected refractive error can contribute to the development of asthenopia. A refractive error is an error in the focusing of light by the eye and can lead to reduced visual acuity. There are various possibilities for optical correction of refractive errors including eyeglasses, contact lenses and refractive surgery. 
Objectives
To examine the evidence on the effectiveness, safety and applicability of optical correction of refractive error for reducing and preventing eye symptoms in computer users. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; Embase; Web of Science; and OSH update, all to 20 December 2017. Additionally, we searched trial registries and checked references of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials of interventions evaluating optical correction for computer workers with refractive error for preventing or treating asthenopia and their effect on health related quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we combined studies in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included eight studies with 381 participants. Three were parallel group RCTs, three were cross‐over RCTs and two were quasi‐randomised cross‐over trials. All studies evaluated eyeglasses, there were no studies that evaluated contact lenses or surgery. Seven studies evaluated computer glasses with at least one focal area for the distance of the computer screen with or without additional focal areas in presbyopic persons. Six studies compared computer glasses to other types of glasses; and one study compared them to an ergonomic workplace assessment. The eighth study compared optimal correction of refractive error with the actual spectacle correction in use. Two studies evaluated computer glasses in persons with asthenopia but for the others the glasses were offered to all workers regardless of symptoms. The risk of bias was unclear in five, high in two and low in one study. Asthenopia was measured as eyestrain or a summary score of symptoms but there were no studies on health‐related quality of life. Adverse events were measured as headache, nausea or dizziness. Median asthenopia scores at baseline were about 30% of the maximum possible score. 
Progressive computer glasses versus monofocal glasses One study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between various progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one‐year follow‐up (mean difference (MD) change scores 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) −5.0 to 5.4 on a 100 mm VAS scale, low quality evidence). For headache the results were in favour of progressive glasses. 
Progressive computer glasses with an intermediate focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glasses In two studies progressive computer glasses with intermediate focus led to a small decrease in asthenopia symptoms (SMD −0.49, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.23, low‐quality evidence) but not in headache score in the short‐term compared to general purpose progressive glasses. There were similar small decreases in dizziness. At medium term follow‐up, in one study the effect size was not statistically significant (SMD −0.64, 95% CI −1.40 to 0.12). The study did not assess adverse events. 
Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one‐year follow‐up (MD change scores 1.44, 95% CI −6.95 to 9.83 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). For headache the results were inconsistent. 
Progressive computer glasses with far‐distance focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glasses One study found no considerable difference in number of persons with asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far‐distance focus and bifocal computer glasses after four weeks' follow‐up (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.50, very low quality evidence). The number of persons with headache, nausea and dizziness was also not different between groups. 
Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far‐distance focus and monofocal computer glasses after one‐year follow‐up (MD change scores −1.79, 95% CI −11.60 to 8.02 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). The effects on headaches were inconsistent. 
One study found no difference between progressive far‐distance focus computer glasses and trifocal glasses in effect on eyestrain severity (MD −0.50, 95% CI −1.07 to 0.07, very low quality evidence) or on eyestrain frequency (MD −0.75, 95% CI −1.61 to 0.11, very low quality evidence).
