Background
Systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), also referred to as hormone therapy, has long been the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Additional agents have been reserved for the castrate‐resistant disease stage when ADT start becoming less effective. Abiraterone is an agent with an established role in that disease stage, which has only recently been evaluated in the hormone‐sensitive setting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early abiraterone acetate, in combination with systemic ADT, for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, two trials registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 15 May 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials, in which men diagnosed with hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer were administered abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with ADT or ADT alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analysesusing a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified two randomized controlled trials (RCT), with 2201 men, who were assigned to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and low dose prednisone (5mg) in addition to ADT, or ADT alone. In the LATITUDE trial, the median age and range of men in the intervention group was 68 (38 to 89) years, and 67 (33 to 92) years in the control group. Nearly all of the men in this study (97.6%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 8 (ISUP grade group 4). 
Primary outcomes 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT reduces the probability of death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 163 fewer deaths per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (210 fewer to 115 fewer) at five years. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life compared to ADT alone, measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐prostate total score (FACT‐P; range 0 to 156; higher values indicates better quality of life), at 12 months (mean difference [MD] 2.90 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.60; 1 RCT, 838 men; moderate certainty of evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
Abiraterone plus ADT increases the risk of grades III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47; 1 RCT, 1199 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 162 more grade III to V events per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (105 more to 224 more) at a median follow‐up of 30 months.
