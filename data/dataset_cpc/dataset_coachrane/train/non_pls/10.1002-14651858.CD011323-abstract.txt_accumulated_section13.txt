Background
An estimated 260,000 children under the age of 15 years acquired HIV infection in 2012. As much as 42% of mother‐to‐child transmission is related to breastfeeding. Antiretroviral prophylaxis for mothers or infants has the potential to prevent mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV through breast milk. 
Objectives
To determine which antiretroviral prophylactic regimens are efficacious and safe for reducing mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding and thereby avert child morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
Using Cochrane Collaboration search methods in conjunction with appropriate search terms, we identified relevant studies from January 1, 1994 to January 14, 2014 by searching databases including Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed, LILACS, and Web of Science/Web of Social Science. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials in which HIV‐infected mothers breastfed their infants, and in which the mothers used antiretroviral prophylaxis while breastfeeding their children or their children received antiretroviral prophylaxis for at least four weeks while breastfeeding, were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Abstracts of all trials identified were examined independently by two authors. We identified 15,922 references and examined 81 in detail. Data were abstracted independently using a standardized form. 
Main results
Seven RCTs were included in the review.
One trial compared triple antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy and breastfeeding with short antiretroviral prophylaxis to given to the mother to prevent mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV. At 12 months, the risks of HIV transmission, and of HIV transmission or death, were lower, but there was no difference in infant mortality alone in the triple arm versus the short arm. Using the GRADE methodology, evidence quality for outcomes in this trial was generally low to moderate.
