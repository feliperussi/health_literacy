Background
Strategies to reduce the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV‐positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks, elective Caesarean section delivery, and avoiding giving children chewed food. In some settings, these interventions may not be practical, feasible, or affordable. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions (that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes) would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low‐cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings. 
Objectives
To summarize the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 25 August 2017, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting that compared vitamin A supplements to placebo or no intervention among HIV‐positive women during pregnancy or after delivery, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) as appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses. This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
Main results
Five trials met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005 and none of the participants received ART. Women allocated to intervention arms received vitamin A supplements at a variety of doses (daily during pregnancy; a single dose immediately after delivery, or daily doses during pregnancy plus a single dose after delivery). Women allocated to comparison arms received identical placebo (6601 women, 4 trials) or no intervention (697 women, 1 trial). Four trials (with 6995 women) had low risk of bias and one trial (with 303 women) had high risk of attrition bias.
