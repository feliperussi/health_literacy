For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in three RCTs was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational interventions aiming at children the pooled rate ratio for injury rates in two RCTs was 1.27 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.16).   One ITS study that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the intervention with an effect size of ‐2.68 (95% CI ‐3.80 to ‐1.56) but did not have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an effect size of ‐0.22 (95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.03).   One ITS study that evaluated the effect of legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased the level of poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of 2.20 (95% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of poisonings over time with an effect size of ‐2.15 (95% CI ‐2.64 to ‐1.66).   One ITS study documented four different regulations aiming to increase the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their effect on injuries and fatal injuries. The introduction of two different pieces of legislation requiring ROPS on new tractors sold after a certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal injuries over the long term (effect size ‐0.93 95% CI ‐1.82 to ‐0.03). Otherwise the introduction of legislation was associated with an increase of injury rates. Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all tractors, old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but with an increase of injuries and fatal injuries over the long term.
