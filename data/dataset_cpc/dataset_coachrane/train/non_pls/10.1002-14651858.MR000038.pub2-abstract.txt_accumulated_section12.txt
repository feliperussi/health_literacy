Background
Improper practices and unprofessional conduct in clinical research have been shown to waste a significant portion of healthcare funds and harm public health. 
Objectives
Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational or policy interventions in research integrity or responsible conduct of research on the behaviour and attitudes of researchers in health and other research areas. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS and CINAHL health research bibliographical databases, as well as the Academic Search Complete, AGRICOLA, GeoRef, PsycINFO, ERIC, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. We performed the last search on 15 April 2015 and the search was limited to articles published between 1990 and 2014, inclusive. We also searched conference proceedings and abstracts from research integrity conferences and specialized websites. We handsearched 14 journals that regularly publish research integrity research. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that measured the effects of one or more interventions, i.e. any direct or indirect procedure that may have an impact on research integrity and responsible conduct of research in its broadest sense, where participants were any stakeholders in research and publication processes, from students to policy makers. We included randomized and non‐randomized controlled trials, such as controlled before‐and‐after studies, with comparisons of outcomes in the intervention versus non‐intervention group or before versus after the intervention. Studies without a control group were not included in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. To assess the risk of bias in non‐randomized studies, we used a modified Cochrane tool, in which we used four out of six original domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, other sources of bias) and two additional domains (comparability of groups and confounding factors). We categorized our primary outcome into the following levels: 1) organizational change attributable to intervention, 2) behavioural change, 3) acquisition of knowledge/skills and 4) modification of attitudes/perceptions. The secondary outcome was participants' reaction to the intervention. 
Main results
Thirty‐one studies involving 9571 participants, described in 33 articles, met the inclusion criteria. All were published in English. Fifteen studies were randomized controlled trials, nine were controlled before‐and‐after studies, four were non‐equivalent controlled studies with a historical control, one was a non‐equivalent controlled study with a post‐test only and two were non‐equivalent controlled studies with pre‐ and post‐test findings for the intervention group and post‐test for the control group. Twenty‐one studies assessed the effects of interventions related to plagiarism and 10 studies assessed interventions in research integrity/ethics. Participants included undergraduates, postgraduates and academics from a range of research disciplines and countries, and the studies assessed different types of outcomes.
