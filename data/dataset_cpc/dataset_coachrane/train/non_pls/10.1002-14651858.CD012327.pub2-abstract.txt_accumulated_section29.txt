Background
Successful treatments for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have the potential to improve health outcomes for women with GDM and their babies. 
Objectives
To provide a comprehensive synthesis of evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews of the benefits and harms associated with interventions for treating GDM on women and their babies. 
Methods
We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (5 January 2018) for reviews of treatment/management for women with GDM. Reviews of pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes were excluded. 
Two overview authors independently assessed reviews for inclusion, quality (AMSTAR; ROBIS), quality of evidence (GRADE), and extracted data. 
Main results
We included 14 reviews. Of these, 10 provided relevant high‐quality and low‐risk of bias data (AMSTAR and ROBIS) from 128 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 27 comparisons, 17,984 women, 16,305 babies, and 1441 children. Evidence ranged from high‐ to very low‐quality (GRADE). Only one effective intervention was found for treating women with GDM. 
Effective 
Lifestyle versus usual care 
Lifestyle intervention versus usual care probably reduces large‐for‐gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71; 6 RCTs, N = 2994; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Promising 
No evidence for any outcome for any comparison could be classified to this category.
Ineffective or possibly harmful 
Lifestyle versus usual care 
Lifestyle intervention versus usual care probably increases the risk of induction of labour (IOL) suggesting possible harm (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.46; 4 RCTs, N = 2699; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Exercise versus control 
Exercise intervention versus control for return to pre‐pregnancy weight suggested ineffectiveness (body mass index, BMI) MD 0.11 kg/m², 95% CI ‐1.04 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, N = 254; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Insulin versus oral therapy 
Insulin intervention versus oral therapy probably increases the risk of IOL suggesting possible harm (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 3 RCTs, N = 348; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Probably ineffective or harmful interventions 
Insulin versus oral therapy 
For insulin compared to oral therapy there is probably an increased risk of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.12; 4 RCTs, N = 1214; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Inconclusive 
Lifestyle versus usual care 
The evidence for childhood adiposity kg/m² (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 RCTs, N = 767; GRADE moderate‐quality) and hypoglycaemia was inconclusive (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.52; 6 RCTs, N = 3000; GRADE moderate‐quality). 
Exercise versus control 
The evidence for caesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 5 RCTs, N = 316; GRADE moderate quality) and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite was inconclusive (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.61; 2 RCTs, N = 169; GRADE moderate‐quality).
