We included 15 trials (1376 participants) in this review. We downgraded the quality of evidence for many of our outcomes on the basis of high risk of bias. Low‐quality evidence suggests that immunonutrition decreases all‐cause mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.80). The effect of immunonutrition on other outcomes from a subset of the included trials was uncertain. Subgrouping trials by type of enteral nutrition did not explain any variation in effect. We found mainly very low‐quality evidence for the effects of probiotics on the main outcomes. One eligible trial in this comparison reported a higher rate of serious adverse events leading to increased organ failure and mortality due to low numbers of events and low risk of bias. When we excluded this study as a post hoc sensitivity analysis, risks of mortality (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.84), organ failure (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92) and local septic complications (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72) were lower with probiotics. In one trial assessing immunonutrition with probiotics and fibres, no deaths occurred, but hospital stay was shorter with immunonutrition (MD ‐5.20 days, 95% CI ‐8.73 to ‐1.67). No deaths were reported following semi‐elemental enteral nutrition (EN), and the effect on length of hospital stay was small (MD 0.30 days, 95% CI ‐0.82 to 1.42). Fibre‐enriched formulations reduced the number of other local complications (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87) and length of hospital stay (MD ‐9.28 days, 95% CI ‐13.21 to ‐5.35) but did not significantly affect all‐cause mortality (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.84) and other outcomes. Very low‐quality evidence from the subgroup of trials comparing EN versus no intervention showed a decrease in all‐cause mortality with EN (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86).
