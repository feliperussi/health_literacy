Background
Debates on effective and safe diets for managing obesity in adults are ongoing. Low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets (also known as 'low‐carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets to weight‐reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets to balanced‐carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight‐reducing diets, have a weight‐reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full‐text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight‐reducing phases only and those with weight‐reducing phases followed by weight‐maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short‐ (three months to < 12 months) and long‐term (≥ 12 months) follow‐up. 
Main results
We included 61 parallel‐arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low‐carbohydrate or balanced‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high‐income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight‐reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight‐reducing phases followed by weight‐maintenance phases was limited. 
Most trials investigated low‐carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (≤ 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low‐carbohydrate, balanced‐fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high‐protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes.  
Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight‐reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg).  
In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets compared to balanced‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets (weight‐reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) −1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.55 to −0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD −0.93 kg, 95% CI −1.81 to −0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low‐certainty evidence).  
In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets compared to balanced‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets (weight‐reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD −1.26 kg, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD −0.33 kg, 95% CI −2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low‐certainty evidence).
