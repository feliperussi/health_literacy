Background
Oral (anti‐oestrogens) and injectable (gonadotrophins) ovulation induction agents have been used to increase the number of eggs produced by a woman per cycle in treatment for unexplained subfertility. It is unclear whether there are significant advantages of one type of treatment over the other in this context or in terms of fertility. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents for unexplained subfertility. 
Search methods
The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group was used for the identification of relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
All trials where oral ovulation induction agents were compared with injectable ovulation induction agents in treatment groups generated by randomisation, from couples with unexplained subfertility, were considered for inclusion in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
Five randomised controlled trials, including a total of 231 identified couples with unexplained subfertility, were found and included in this review. All trials were assessed for quality criteria. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage, multiple birth, occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and cycle cancellation. 
Main results
Where trials with important co‐interventions were excluded, there was no significant difference in the odds of beneficial outcomes for oral versus injectable ovulation induction agents ‐ live birth per couple (OR 0.06, 95%CI 0.00 to 1.15), pregnancy per woman (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.09 to 1.20); nor of detrimental outcomes for injectable versus oral agents ‐ miscarriage (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.00 to 2.84); there were no reported cases of multiple births, cases of ovarian hyperstimulation or discontinued cycles consequent upon overstimulation.
