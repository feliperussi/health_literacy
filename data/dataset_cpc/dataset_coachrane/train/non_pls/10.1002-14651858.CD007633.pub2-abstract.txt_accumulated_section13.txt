Background
Psoriasis is a common skin disease that can also involve the nails. All parts of the nail and surrounding structures can become affected. The incidence of nail involvement increases with duration of psoriasis. Although it is difficult to treat psoriatic nails, the condition may respond to therapy. 
Objectives
To assess evidence for the efficacy and safety of the treatments for nail psoriasis.
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to March 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials databases and checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
Selection criteria
All RCTs of any design concerning interventions for nail psoriasis.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted the data. We collected adverse effects from the included studies.   
Main results
We included 18 studies involving 1266 participants. We were not able to pool due to the heterogeneity of many of the studies. 
Our primary outcomes were 'Global improvement of nail psoriasis as rated by a clinician', 'Improvement of nail psoriasis scores (NAS, NAPSI)', 'Improvement of nail psoriasis in the participant's opinion'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Adverse effects (and serious adverse effects)'; 'Effects on quality of life'; and 'Improvement in nail features, pain score, nail thickness, thickness of subungual hyperkeratosis, number of affected nails, and nail growth'. We assessed short‐term (3 to 6 months), medium‐term (6 to 12 months), and long‐term (> 12 months) treatments separately if possible.
