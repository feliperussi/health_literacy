Background
Migraine is a common neurological problem associated with the highest burden amongst neurological conditions in terms of years lived with disability. Medications can be used as prophylaxis or rescue medicines, but are costly and not always effective. A range of psychological interventions have been developed to manage migraine. 
Objectives
The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from their inception until July 2018, and trials registries in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand for randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention for adults with migraine. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a psychological therapy for people with chronic or episodic migraine, with or without aura. Interventions could be compared to another active treatment (psychological or medical), an attention‐placebo (e.g. supportive counselling) or other placebo, routine care, or waiting‐list control. We excluded studies where fewer than 15 participants completed each arm. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted study characteristics and outcome data at post‐treatment and the longest available follow‐up. We analysed intervention versus control comparisons for the primary outcome of migraine frequency. We measured migraine frequency using days with migraines or number of migraine attacks measured in the four weeks after treatment. In addition, we analysed the following secondary outcomes: responder rate (the proportion of participants with a 50% reduction in migraine frequency between the four weeks prior to and the four weeks after treatment); migraine intensity; migraine duration; migraine medication usage; mood; quality of life; migraine‐related disability; and proportion of participants reporting adverse events during the treatment. We included these variables, where available, at follow‐up, the timing of which varied between the studies. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence.
