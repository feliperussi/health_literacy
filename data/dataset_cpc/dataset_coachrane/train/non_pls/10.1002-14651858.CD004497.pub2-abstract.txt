Background
Apnea of prematurity is a common problem in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care setting (NICU) often delaying their discharge home or transfer to a step down unit. Premature infants are at increased risk of carnitine deficiency. Carnitine supplementation has been used for both prevention and treatment of apnoea. 
Objectives
To determine whether treatment with carnitine will reduce the frequency of apnoea, the duration of ventilation and the duration of hospital stay in preterm infants with recurrent apnoea. 
Search methods
Computerised searches were carried out independently by two reviewer authors. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 2010), EMBASE (1988 to December 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2010), abstracts of annual meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research (1995 to 2010), and contacts were made with the subject experts. 
Selection criteria
Only randomised or quasi‚Äêrandomised treatment trials of preterm infants with a diagnosis of recurrent apnoea of prematurity were considered. Trials were included if they involved treatment with carnitine compared to placebo or no treatment, and measured at least one of the following outcomes: failure of resolution of apneas, the duration of ventilation and the duration of hospital stay. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewer authors evaluated the papers for inclusion criteria and quality. Corresponding authors were contacted for further information where needed. 
Main results
No eligible trials were identified.
Authors' conclusions
Despite the plausible rationale for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity with carnitine, there are insufficient data to support its use for this indication. Further studies are needed to determine the role of this treatment in clinical practice.
