Background
Women are more vulnerable to malaria during pregnancy, and malaria infection may have adverse consequences for the fetus. Identifying safe and effective treatments is important. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of drug regimens for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnant women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (February 2008), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), EMBASE (1974 to February 2008), LILACS (February 2008), mRCT (February 2008), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials of antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed a quantitative analysis only where we could combine the data. We combined dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and presented each result with a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Main results
Ten trials (1805 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two were quasi‐randomized, seven did not describe allocation concealment, and all adjusted treatment failure to exclude new infections. One trial reported fewer treatment failures at day 63 with artesunate plus mefloquine compared with quinine (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.38; 106 participants). One trial reported fewer treatment failures at day 63 with artesunate plus atovaquone‐proguanil compared with quinine (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57; 80 participants). One trial reported fewer treatment failures at day 28 when amodiaquine was compared with chloroquine (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.46; 420 participants) and when amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine was compared with chloroquine (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.26; 418 participants). Compared with sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine given alone, one trial reported fewer treatment failures at delivery (or day 40) with artesunate plus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.59; 79 participants) and azithromycin plus sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76; 82 participants).
