Background
Thalassaemia is a group of genetic blood disorders characterised by the absence or reduction in the production of haemoglobin. Severity is variable from less severe anaemia, through thalassaemia intermedia, to profound severe anaemia (thalassaemia major). In thalassaemia major other complications include growth retardation, bone deformation, and enlarged spleen. Blood transfusion is required to treat severe forms of thalassaemia, but this results in excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removed mostly by a drug called desferrioxamine through 'chelation therapy'. Non‐routine treatments are bone marrow transplantation (which is age restricted), and possibly hydroxyurea, designed to raise foetal haemoglobin level, thus reducing anaemia. In addition, psychological therapies seem appropriate to improving outcome and adherence to medical treatment. 
Objectives
To examine the evidence that in people with thalassaemia, psychological treatments improve the ability to cope with the condition, and improve both medical and psychosocial outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Searches on the Internet were also performed. 
Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 11 November 2013. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing the use of psychological intervention to no (psychological) intervention in people with thalassaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
No trials of psychological therapies have been found in the literature for inclusion in this review. 
Main results
There are currently no results to be reported.
Authors' conclusions
As a chronic disease with a considerable role for self‐management, psychological support seems appropriate for managing thalassaemia. However, from the information currently available, no conclusions can be made about the use of specific psychological therapies in thalassaemia. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre, randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific psychological interventions for thalassaemia.
