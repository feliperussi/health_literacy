Background
For decades, the indication of analgesia in patients with Acute Abdominal Pain (AAP) has been deferred until the definitive diagnosis has been made, for fear of masking symptoms, generating a change in the physical exploration or obstructing the diagnosis of a disease requiring surgical treatment. This strategy has been questioned by some studies that have shown that the use of analgesia in the initial evaluation of patients with AAP leads to a significant reduction in pain without affecting diagnostic accuracy. 
Objectives
To determine whether the evidence available supports the use of opioid analgesics in the diagnostic process of patients with AAP. 
Search methods
Trials were identified through searches in Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to 2009). A randomised controlled trial (RCT) filter for a MEDLINE search was applied (with appropriate modification for an EMBASE search). Trials also were identified through "related articles". The search was not limited by language or publication status. 
Selection criteria
All published RCTs which included adult patients with AAP, without gender restriction, comparing any opioids analgesia regimen with the non‐use of analgesic before any intervention and independent of the results. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent reviewers assessed the studies identified via the electronic search. Articles that were relevant and pertinent to the aims of the study were selected and their respective full‐text versions were collected for subsequent blinded evaluation. The allocation concealment was considered in particular as an option to diminish the biases.
