Background
Diarrhoeal disorders and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), especially pneumonia, are the most common causes of death in low‐income countries. Studies evaluating the impact of zinc supplementation as an adjunct in the management of pneumonia are limited and have shown variable results. 
Objectives
To evaluate zinc supplementation, as an adjunct to antibiotics, in the treatment (clinical recovery) of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's and the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's Specialised Registers, MEDLINE (1950 to March week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to March 2011), CINAHL (1981 to March 2011), LILACS (1985 to March 2011), AMED (1985 to March 2011), CAB Abstracts (1910 to March 2011) and Web of Science (2000 to March 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised control trials (RCTs) evaluating supplementation of zinc as an adjunct to antibiotics for pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and screened all available titles and abstracts for inclusion. If the relevance could not be ascertained by screening the title and abstract, we retrieved and reviewed the full text of the article. 
Main results
We included four trials in which 3267 children aged two to 35 months participated. Analysis showed that zinc supplementation in addition to standard antibiotic therapy in children with severe and non‐severe pneumonia failed to show a statistically significant effect on time‐to‐clinical recovery (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.11). Similary, zinc supplementation in children with severe pneumonia, as an adjunct to standard antibiotic therapy, did not show a statistically significant effect on time‐to‐recovery from tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 50 breaths per minute) (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.57) and time‐to‐recovery from chest in‐drawing (hazard ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.31) as compared to the control group. Zinc supplementation in children with severe pneumonia also showed a non‐significant effect on time‐to‐hospital discharge as compared to the control (hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.22).
