We studied 8228 women in nine studies. Eight out of nine studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. Altered fraction size (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on: local recurrence‐free survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15, 7095 women, four studies, high‐quality evidence), cosmetic outcome (Risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01, 2103 women, four studies, high‐quality evidence) or overall survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03, 5685 women, three studies, high‐quality evidence). Acute radiation skin toxicity (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45, 357 women, two studies) was reduced with altered fraction size. Late radiation subcutaneous toxicity did not differ with altered fraction size (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, 5130 women, four studies, high‐quality evidence). Breast cancer‐specific survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 5685 women, three studies, high quality evidence) and relapse‐free survival (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, 5685 women, three studies, moderate‐quality evidence) did not differ with altered fraction size. We found no data for mastectomy rate. Altered fraction size was associated with less patient‐reported (P < 0.001) and physician‐reported (P = 0.009) fatigue at six months (287 women, one study). We found no difference in the issue of altered fractionation for patient‐reported outcomes of: physical well‐being (P = 0.46), functional well‐being (P = 0.38), emotional well‐being (P = 0.58), social well‐being (P = 0.32), breast cancer concerns (P = 0.94; 287 women, one study). We found no data with respect to costs.
