Background
Progesterone prepares the endometrium for pregnancy by stimulating proliferation in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the corpus luteum in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In assisted reproduction techniques (ART), progesterone and/or hCG levels are low, so the luteal phase is supported with progesterone, hCG or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to improve implantation and pregnancy rates. 
Objectives
To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of methods of luteal phase support provided to subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We searched databases including the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and trial registers up to November 2014. Further searches were undertaken in August 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of luteal phase support using progesterone, hCG or GnRH agonist supplementation in ART cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was live birth or ongoing pregnancy. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods. 
Main results
Ninety‐four RCTs (26,198 women) were included. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias in most domains. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision due to small sample sizes. 
1. hCG vs placebo/no treatment (five RCTs, 746 women) 
Findings suggested benefit for the hCG group in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates when data were analysed with a fixed‐effect model (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.86, three RCTs, 527 women, I2 = 24%, very low‐quality evidence) but there was no clear evidence of a difference using a random‐effects model (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.12). hCG may increase ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rates (OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.91 to 9.6, one RCT, 387 women, low‐quality evidence). 
2. Progesterone vs placebo/no treatment (eight RCTs, 875 women) 
Findings suggested benefit for the progesterone group in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates when data were analysed with a fixed‐effect model (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.86, five RCTs, 642 women, I2 = 35%, very low‐quality evidence) but there was no clear evidence of a difference using a random‐effects model (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.26). OHSS was not reported. 
3. Progesterone vs hCG regimens (16 RCTs, 2162 women) 
hCG regimens included hCG alone and hCG with progesterone. There was no evidence of a difference between progesterone and hCG regimens in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.38, five RCTs, 833 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). Progesterone was associated with lower OHSS rates than hCG regimens (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.71, 5 RCTs, 1293 women , I2=48%). 
4. Progesterone vs progesterone with oestrogen (16 RCTs, 2577 women) 
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.38, nine RCTs, 1651 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence) or OHSS (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.63, two RCTs, 461 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). 
5. Progesterone vs progesterone + GnRH agonist (seven RCTs, 1708 women) 
Live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates were lower in the progesterone‐only group than the progesterone plus GnRH agonist group (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81, nine RCTs, 2861 women, I2 = 55%, random effects, low‐quality evidence). Statistical heterogeneity was high but the direction of effect was consistent across studies. OHSS was reported in one study only; there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.01, one RCT, 300 women, very low quality evidence). 
6. Progesterone regimens (45 RCTs, 13,814 women) 
There were nine different comparisons between progesterone regimens. Findings for live birth or ongoing pregnancy were as follows: intramuscular (IM) versus oral: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.66 (one RCT, 40 women, very low‐quality evidence); IM versus vaginal/rectal: OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.99 (seven RCTs, 2309 women, I2 = 71%, random effects, very low‐quality evidence); vaginal/rectal versus oral: OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69 (four RCTs, 857 women, I2 = 32%, low‐quality evidence); low‐dose versus high‐dose vaginal: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11 (five RCTs, 3720 women, I2 = 0%, moderate‐quality evidence); short versus long protocol: OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36 (five RCTs, 1205 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence); micronised versus synthetic: OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.55 (two RCTs, 470 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence); vaginal ring versus gel: OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36 (one RCT, 1271 women, low‐quality evidence); subcutaneous versus vaginal gel: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14 (two RCTs, 1465 women, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence); vaginal versus rectal: OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.54 (one RCT, 147 women, very low‐quality evidence). OHSS rates were reported for only two comparisons: IM versus oral, and low versus high‐dose vaginal; there was no evidence of a difference between the groups.
