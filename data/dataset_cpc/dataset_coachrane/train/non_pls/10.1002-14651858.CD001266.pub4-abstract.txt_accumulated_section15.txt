Background
Bronchiolitis is an acute, viral lower respiratory tract infection affecting infants and is sometimes treated with bronchodilators. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of bronchodilators on clinical outcomes in infants (0 to 12 months) with acute bronchiolitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January Week 2, 2014) and EMBASE (1998 to January 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bronchodilators (other than epinephrine) with placebo for bronchiolitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. We obtained unpublished data from trial authors. 
Main results
We included 30 trials (35 data sets) representing 1992 infants with bronchiolitis. In 11 inpatient and 10 outpatient studies, oxygen saturation did not improve with bronchodilators (mean difference (MD) ‐0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.92 to 0.06, n = 1242). Outpatient bronchodilator treatment did not reduce the rate of hospitalization (11.9% in bronchodilator group versus 15.9% in placebo group, odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.21, n = 710). Inpatient bronchodilator treatment did not reduce the duration of hospitalization (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.39, n = 349). 
Effect estimates for inpatients (MD ‐0.62, 95% CI ‐1.40 to 0.16) were slightly larger than for outpatients (MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.11) for oximetry. Oximetry outcomes showed significant heterogeneity (I2 statistic = 81%). Including only studies with low risk of bias had little impact on the overall effect size of oximetry (MD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.75 to 0.00) but results were close to statistical significance. 
In eight inpatient studies, there was no change in average clinical score (standardized MD (SMD) ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.12) with bronchodilators. In nine outpatient studies, the average clinical score decreased slightly with bronchodilators (SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.79 to ‐0.06), a statistically significant finding of questionable clinical importance. The clinical score outcome showed significant heterogeneity (I2 statistic = 73%). Including only studies with low risk of bias reduced the heterogeneity but had little impact on the overall effect size of average clinical score (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.03). 
Sub‐analyses limited to nebulized albuterol or salbutamol among outpatients (nine studies) showed no effect on oxygen saturation (MD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.21, n = 572), average clinical score (SMD ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.11, n = 532) or hospital admission after treatment (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33, n = 404).
