Background
Parents and family carers of children with complex needs experience a high level of pressure to meet children's needs while maintaining family functioning and, as a consequence, often experience reduced well‐being and elevated psychological distress. Peer support interventions are intended to improve parent and carer well‐being by enhancing the social support available to them. Support may be delivered via peer mentoring or through support groups (peer or facilitator led). 
Peer support interventions are widely available, but the potential benefits and risks of such interventions are not well established. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of peer support interventions (compared to usual care or alternate interventions) on psychological and psychosocial outcomes, including adverse outcomes, for parents and other family carers of children with complex needs in any setting.
