Background
Musculoskeletal conditions require particular management skills. Identification of interventions which are effective in equipping general practitioners (GPs) with such necessary skills could translate to improved health outcomes for patients and reduced healthcare and societal costs. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of professional interventions for GPs that aim to improve the management of musculoskeletal conditions in primary care.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2010, Issue 2; MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 ‐ October 2013); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 ‐ Ocotber 2013); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980 ‐ November 2013), and the EPOC Specialised Register. We conducted cited reference searches using ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar; and handsearched selected issues of Arthritis and Rheumatism and Primary Care‐Clinics in Office Practice. The latest search was conducted in November 2013. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of professional interventions for GPs, taking place in a community setting, aiming to improve the management (including diagnosis and treatment) of musculoskeletal conditions and reporting any objective measure of GP behaviour, patient or economic outcomes. We considered professional interventions of any length, duration, intensity and complexity compared with active or inactive controls. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently abstracted all data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) of compliance with desired practice for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes. We investigated whether the direction of the targeted behavioural change affects the effectiveness of interventions.
