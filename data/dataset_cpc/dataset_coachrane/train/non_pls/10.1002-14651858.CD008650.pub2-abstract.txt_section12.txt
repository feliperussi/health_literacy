Due to the level of heterogeneity among studies, studies were divided into two groups; those conducted in Japan and those conducted outside Japan. Study length ranged between 12 and 13 weeks. Meta‐analysis of six studies conducted outside Japan showed a mean difference (MD) in weight loss of ‐0.04 kg (95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.88; I2 = 18%; 532 participants). The eight studies conducted in Japan were not similar enough to allow pooling of results and MD in weight loss ranged from ‐0.2 kg to ‐3.5 kg (1030 participants) in favour of green tea preparations. Meta‐analysis of studies measuring change in body mass index (BMI) conducted outside Japan showed a MD in BMI of ‐0.2 kg/m2 (95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.1; P = 0.21; I2 = 38%; 222 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed a reduction in BMI ranging from no effect to ‐1.3 kg/m2 (1030 participants), in favour of green tea preparations over control. Meta‐analysis of five studies conducted outside Japan and measuring waist circumference reported a MD of ‐0.2 cm (95% CI ‐1.4 to 0.9; P = 0.70; I2 = 58%; 404 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed effects on waist circumference ranging from a gain of 1 cm to a loss of 3.3 cm (1030 participants). Meta‐analysis for three weight loss studies, conducted outside Japan, with waist‐to‐hip ratio data (144 participants) yielded no significant change (MD 0; 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01). Analysis of two studies conducted to determine if green tea could help to maintain weight after a period of weight loss (184 participants) showed a change in weight loss of 0.6 to ‐1.6 kg, a change in BMI from 0.2 to ‐0.5 kg/m2 and a change in waist circumference from 0.3 to ‐1.7 cm. In the eight studies that recorded adverse events, four reported adverse events that were mild to moderate, with the exception of two (green tea preparations group) that required hospitalisation (reported as not associated with the intervention). Nine studies reported on compliance/adherence, one study assessed attitude towards eating as part of the health‐related quality of life outcome. No studies reported on patient satisfaction, morbidity or cost.
