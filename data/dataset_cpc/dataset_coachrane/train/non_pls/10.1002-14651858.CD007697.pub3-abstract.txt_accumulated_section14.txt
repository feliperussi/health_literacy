Background
Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women and the leading cause of death in women with gynaecological malignancies. Opinions differ regarding the role of ultra‐radical (extensive) cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer treatment. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and morbidity associated with ultra‐radical/extensive surgery in the management of advanced‐stage epithelial ovarian cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid and Embase Ovid up to November 2021. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐randomised studies (NRS), analysed using multivariate methods, that compared ultra‐radical/extensive and standard surgery in women with advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We identified three NRS and conducted meta‐analyses where possible. 
Main results
We identified three retrospective observational studies for inclusion in the review. Two studies included women exclusively undergoing upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) and the other study including both PDS and interval debulking surgical (IDS) procedures. All studies were at critical risk of bias due to retrospective and non‐randomised study designs. 
Meta‐analysis of two studies, assessing 397 participants, found that women who underwent radical procedures, as part of PDS, may have a lower risk of mortality compared to women who underwent standard surgery (adjusted HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.82; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The results were robust to a sensitivity analysis including women with more‐extensive disease (carcinomatosis) (adjusted HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.85; I2 = 0%; n = 283, very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. 
One study reported a comparison of radical versus standard surgical procedures associated with both PDS and IDS procedures, but a multivariate analysis was only undertaken for disease‐free survival (DFS) and therefore the certainty of the evidence was not assessable for overall survival (OS) and remains very low. The lack of reporting of OS meant the study was at high risk of bias for selective reporting of outcomes.
