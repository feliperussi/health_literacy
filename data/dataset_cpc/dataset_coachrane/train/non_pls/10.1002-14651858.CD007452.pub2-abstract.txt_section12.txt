We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta‐blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross‐over studies. Overall, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta‐blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose‐response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta‐blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was ‐10 mmHg (95% CI ‐11 to ‐8) for systolic BP and ‐7 mmHg (95% CI ‐8 to ‐6) for diastolic BP (low‐quality evidence). Nonselective beta‐blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low‐quality evidence). The dose‐response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (‐2.2 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.7 to ‐0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta‐blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).
