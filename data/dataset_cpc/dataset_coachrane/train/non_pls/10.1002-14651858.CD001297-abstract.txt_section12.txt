Thirty studies involving 2,391 women were included, however only 15, involving 910 women, could be included in the meta‐analysis. The meta‐analysis showed that danazol and progesterone + oestrogen add‐back are protective of BMD at the lumbar spine both during treatment and for up to six and twelve months after treatment, respectively. Between the groups receiving GnRHa and the groups receiving danazol/gestrinone, there was a significant difference in percentage change of BMD after six months of treatment, the GnRH analogue producing a reduction in BMD from baseline and danazol producing an increase in BMD (SMD ‐3.43, 95 % CI ‐3.91 to ‐2.95). Progesterone only add‐back is not protective; after six months of treatment absolute value BMD measurements of the lumbar spine did not differ significantly from the group receiving GnRH analogues (SMD 0.15, 95 % CI ‐0.21 to 0.52). In the comparison of GnRHa versus GnRHa + HRT add‐back, that is oestrogen + progesterone or oestrogen only, there was a significantly bigger BMD loss in the GnRHa only group (SMD ‐0.49, 95 % CI ‐0.77 to ‐0.21). These numbers reflect the absolute value measurements at the lumbar spine after six months of treatment. Due to the small number of studies in the comparison we are unable to conclude whether calcium‐regulating agents are protective. No difference was found between low and high dose add‐back regimes but again only one study was identified for this comparison. Only one study comparing GnRH analogues with placebo was identified, but the study gave no data. No studies comparing GnRH with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or progestagens were identified.
