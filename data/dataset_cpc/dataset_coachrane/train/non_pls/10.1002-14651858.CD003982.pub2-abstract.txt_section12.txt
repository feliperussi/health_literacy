The five trials that met our criteria included 698 patients: data from 499 (71.5%) were available for analysis of relapse frequency at one year's, from 488 (70%) at two years' and from 415 (59.5%) at three years' follow‐up. Azathioprine reduced the number of patients who had relapses during the first year of treatment (relative risk reduction [RRR] =20%; 95% CI = 5% to 33%), at two years' (RRR =23%; 95% CI = 12% to 33%) and three years' (RRR =18%; 95% CI = 7% to 27%) follow‐up. These results were consistent in sensitivity analysis. There was no heterogeneity among the studies.  Data from only three small trials with a total of 87 patients were available to calculate the number of patients who progressed during the first two to three years. There was a statistically significant benefit (RRR = 42%; 95% CI = 7% to 64%) of azathioprine therapy at three years' follow‐up; this result was robust after sensitivity analyses and there was no heterogeneity among the trials.  Gastrointestinal disturbances, bone marrow suppression and hepatic toxicity were greater in the azathioprine group rather than in the placebo group; they were anticipated, and, by monitoring and dosage adjustment, were easily managed. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were few, occurring mostly during the first year of azathioprine treatment and mainly due to gastrointestinal intolerance (5%).  Data from the trials and from cohort and case controls studies available in the literature did not show an increase in risk of malignancy from azathioprine. A possible long‐term risk of cancer from azathioprine may be related to a treatment duration above ten years and cumulative doses above 600 g.
