Background
Breast‐conserving therapy for women with breast cancer consists of local excision of the tumour (achieving clear margins) followed by radiotherapy (RT). Most true recurrences occur in the same quadrant as the original tumour. Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) may not protect against the development of a new primary cancer developing in other quadrants of the breast. In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the delivery of radiation to a limited volume of the breast around the tumour bed (partial breast irradiation (PBI)) sometimes with a shortened treatment duration (accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
Objectives
To determine whether PBI/APBI is equivalent to or better than conventional or hypofractionated WBRT after breast‐conserving therapy for early‐stage breast cancer. 
Search methods
On 27 August 2020, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and three trial databases. We searched for grey literature: OpenGrey (September 2020), reference lists of articles, conference proceedings and published abstracts, and applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) without confounding, that evaluated conservative surgery plus PBI/APBI versus conservative surgery plus WBRT. Published and unpublished trials were eligible. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (BH and ML) performed data extraction, used Cochrane's risk of bias tool and resolved any disagreements through discussion, and assessed the certainty of the evidence for main outcomes using GRADE. Main outcomes were local recurrence‐free survival, cosmesis, overall survival, toxicity (subcutaneous fibrosis), cause‐specific survival, distant metastasis‐free survival and subsequent mastectomy. We entered data into Review Manager 5 for analysis. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs that enrolled 15,187 women who had invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in‐situ (6.3%) with T1‐2N0‐1M0 Grade I or II unifocal tumours (less than 2 cm or 3 cm or less) treated with breast‐conserving therapy with negative margins. This is the second update of the review and includes two new studies and 4432 more participants. 
Local recurrence‐free survival is probably slightly reduced (by 3/1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 0 fewer) with the use of PBI/APBI compared to WBRT (hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 8 studies, 13,168 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Cosmesis (physician/nurse‐reported) is probably worse (by 63/1000, 95% CI 35 more to 92 more) with the use of PBI/APBI (odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.87; 6 studies, 3652 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Overall survival is similar (0/1000 fewer, 95% CI 6 fewer to 6 more) with PBI/APBI and WBRT (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; 8 studies, 13,175 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Late radiation toxicity (subcutaneous fibrosis) is probably increased (by 14/1000 more, 95% CI 102 more to 188 more) with PBI/APBI (OR 5.07, 95% CI 3.81 to 6.74; 2 studies, 3011 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).
