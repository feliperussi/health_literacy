Background
The most commonly used types of phototherapy for treating psoriasis are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB); broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), which includes selective (delivering radiation with a wavelength range of 305 to 325 nm) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm); and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (oral or bath PUVA). There is substantial controversy regarding their efficacy when compared with each other. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for psoriasis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), and EMBASE (from 1974). We searched the following databases up to November 2012: CNKI (from 1974) and CBM (from 1978). We also searched trials registers and the OpenGrey database. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NB‐UVB phototherapy with BB‐UVB or PUVA for treating psoriasis, which included chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP), guttate psoriasis (GP), and palmoplantar psoriasis (PPP). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently conducted the study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 662 participants. We report the results of intention‐to‐treat analyses (ITT) here. Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant‐rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side‐effects, and Clearance rate.
