Background
Chemotherapy‐induced neutropenia is a common adverse effect in children with cancer. Due to the high relative risk of infections and infectious complications, standard care for children with cancer and febrile neutropenia consists of routine hospitalization and parenteral administration of broad‐spectrum antibiotics. However, there are less serious causes of febrile neutropenia; in a subgroup of these children, lengthy in‐hospital treatment might be unnecessary. Various research groups have studied the adjustment of standard care to shorten in‐hospital treatment for children with cancer and febrile neutropenia at low risk for bacterial infections. However, most of these studies were not done in a randomized matter. 
Objectives
To evaluate whether early discharge (mean/median of less than five days) from in‐hospital treatment was not inferior to non‐early discharge (mean/median of five days or more) and whether very early discharge (mean/median of less than 24 hours) was not inferior to early discharge, non‐early discharge, or a combination of these, in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to December 2015), EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to December 2015), the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles, and various conference proceedings (dependent on availability from 2005 to 2010 to 2013 to 2015). We scanned the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Register, the National Institute of Health Register for ongoing trials, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 9 January 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in which children with cancer and febrile neutropenia were divided in groups with different times of discharge.
