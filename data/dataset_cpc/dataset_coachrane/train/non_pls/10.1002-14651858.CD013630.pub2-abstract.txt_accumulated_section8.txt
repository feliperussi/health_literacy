Background
Multiple studies have identified the prognostic relevance of extent of resection in the management of glioma. Different intraoperative technologies have emerged in recent years with unknown comparative efficacy in optimising extent of resection. One previous Cochrane Review provided low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence in single trial analyses and synthesis of results was not possible. The role of intraoperative technology in maximising extent of resection remains uncertain. Due to the multiple complementary technologies available, this research question is amenable to a network meta‐analysis methodological approach. 
Objectives
To establish the comparative effectiveness and risk profile of specific intraoperative imaging technologies using a network meta‐analysis and to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a brief economic commentary. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via Ovid to May week 2 2020, and Embase via Ovid to 2020 week 20. We performed backward searching of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, Neuro‐oncology and the Journal of Neuro‐oncology from 1990 to 2019 including all conference abstracts. Finally, we contacted recognised experts in neuro‐oncology to identify any additional eligible studies and acquire information on ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
Selection criteria
RCTs evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included fluorescence‐guided surgery, intraoperative ultrasound, neuronavigation (with or without additional image processing, e.g. tractography), and intraoperative MRI.
