Background
There remains uncertainty about the optimum timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in HIV‐positive people with cryptococcal meningitis. This uncertainty is the result of conflicting data on the mortality risk and occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) when ART is initiated less than four weeks after cryptococcal meningitis treatment is commenced. 
Objectives
To compare the outcomes of early initiation of ART (less than four weeks after starting antifungal treatment) versus delayed initiation of ART (four weeks or more after starting antifungal treatment) in HIV‐positive people with concurrent cryptococcal meningitis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for trials published between 1 January 1980 and 7 August 2017. We additionally searched international trial registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and conference abstracts from the International AIDS Society (IAS) and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) for ongoing or unpublished studies between 2015 and 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included studies to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared early versus delayed ART initiation in HIV‐positive people with cryptococcal meningitis. Children, adults, and adolescents from any setting were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented time‐to‐death data as hazard ratios with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Four trials including 294 adult participants met the inclusion criteria of this review. Participants were predominantly from low‐ and middle‐income countries. Two trials treated cryptococcal meningitis with amphotericin B and fluconazole; a third trial used fluconazole monotherapy; and the fourth trial did not specify the antifungal used.
