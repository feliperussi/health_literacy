Background
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal problem of preterm neonates. There have been reports published suggesting that the use of enteral antibiotics may be effective as prophylaxis. This systematic review was undertaken to clarify the issue. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of enteral antibiotic prophylaxis for necrotizing enterocolitis in low birth weight and preterm infants. 
Search methods
Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ July 2006), EMBASE (1988 ‐ July 2006) and CINAHL (1982 ‐ July 2006) previous reviews with cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching in the fields of neonatal pediatrics and microbiology. 
Selection criteria
All randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials where enteral antibiotics were used as prophylaxis against NEC in LBW (< 2500 g) and/or preterm (< 37 weeks gestation) infants. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group was used. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by the second author who was blinded to the trial authors and institutions. Each author extracted data separately before comparison and resolution of differences. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat were used in the analysis. 
Main results
Five eligible trials involving 456 infants were included. The administration of prophylactic enteral antibiotics resulted in a statistically significant reduction in NEC [typical RR 0.47 (0.28, 0.78); typical RD ‐0.10 (‐0.16, ‐0.04); NNT 10 (6, 25)].
