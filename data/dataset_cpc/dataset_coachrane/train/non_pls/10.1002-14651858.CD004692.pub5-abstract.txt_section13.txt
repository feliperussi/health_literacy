For the placebo comparison, n‐3PUFA supplementation resulted in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) (random‐effects model) −0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.64 to −0.16; 33 studies, 1848 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. An SMD of 0.40 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17‐item) of approximately 2.5 points (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0), where the minimal clinically important change score on this scale is 3.0 points. The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well‐conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate may be biased towards a positive finding for n‐3PUFAs. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64; 24 studies, 1503 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), the confidence intervals include a small decrease to a modest increase in adverse events with n‐3PUFAs. There was no evidence for a difference between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; 8 studies, 609 participants, low‐certainty evidence), response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79; 17 studies, 794 participants; low‐certainty evidence), quality of life (SMD −0.38 (95% CI −0.82 to 0.06), 12 studies, 476 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), or trial non‐completion (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 29 studies, 1777 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence on which these results are based was also very limited, highly heterogeneous, and potentially biased.
