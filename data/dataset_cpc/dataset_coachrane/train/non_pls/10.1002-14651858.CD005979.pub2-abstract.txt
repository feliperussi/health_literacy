Background
Pharmaceuticals are important interventions that could improve people's health. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used as cost‐containment measures to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Internal reference pricing establishes a benchmark or reference price within a country which is the maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs. Other policies include price controls, maximum prices, index pricing, price negotiations and volume‐based pricing. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, drug expenditures and drug use.

Selection criteria
Policies in this review were defined as laws; rules; financial and administrative orders made by governments, non‐government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation and health outcomes or costs (expenditures); the study had to be a randomised trial, non‐randomised trial, interrupted time series (ITS), repeated measures (RM) study or a controlled before‐after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Results were summarised in tables. There were too few comparisons with similar outcomes across studies to allow for meta‐analysis or meaningful exploration of heterogeneity. 
Main results
We included 18 studies (seven identified in the update): 17 of reference pricing, one of which also assessed maximum prices, and one of index pricing. None of the studies were trials. All included studies used ITS or RM analyses. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. Three reference pricing studies reported cumulative drug expenditures at one year after the transition period. Two studies reported the median relative insurer's cumulative expenditures, on both reference drugs and cost share drugs, of ‐18%, ranging from ‐36% to 3%. The third study reported relative insurer's cumulative expenditures on total market of ‐1.5%. Four reference pricing studies reported median relative insurer's expenditures on both reference drugs and cost share drugs of ‐10%, ranging from ‐53% to 4% at one year after the transition period. Four reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of 15% in reference drugs prescriptions at one year (range ‐14% to 166%). Three reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of ‐39% in cost share drugs prescriptions at one year (range ‐87% to ‐17%). One study of index pricing reported a relative change of 55% (95% CI 11% to 98%) in the use of generic drugs and ‐43% relative change (95% CI ‐67% to ‐18%) in brand drugs at six months after the transition period. The same study reported a price change of ‐5.3% and ‐1.1% for generic and brand drugs respectively six months after the start of the policy. One study of maximum prices reported a relative change in monthly sales volume of all statins of 21% (95% CI 19% to 24%) after one year of the introduction of this policy. Four studies reported effects on mortality and healthcare utilisation, however they were excluded because of study design limitations. 
Authors' conclusions
The majority of the studies of pricing and purchasing policies that met our inclusion criteria evaluated reference pricing. We found that internal reference pricing may reduce expenditures in the short term by shifting drug use from cost share drugs to reference drugs. Reference pricing may reduce related expenditures with effects on reference drugs but the effect on expenditures of cost share drugs is uncertain. Reference pricing may increase the use of reference drugs and may reduce the use of cost share drugs. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patients' drug expenditures were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported. Reference pricing effects on health are uncertain due to lack of evidence. The effects of other purchasing and pricing policies are until now uncertain due to sparse evidence. However, index pricing may reduce the use of brand drugs, increase the use of generic drugs, and may also slightly reduce the price of the generic drug when compared with no intervention.
