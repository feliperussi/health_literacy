The most consistent evidence supports the use of cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and particularly their combination for assisting with reduction of cannabis use frequency at early follow‐up (MET: MD 4.45, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.00, four studies, 612 participants; CBT: MD 10.94, 95% CI 7.44 to 14.44, one study, 134 participants; MET + CBT: MD 7.38, 95% CI 3.18 to 11.57, three studies, 398 participants) and severity of dependence (MET: SMD 4.07, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.17, two studies, 316 participants; MET + CBT: SMD 7.89, 95% CI 0.93 to 14.85, three studies, 573 participants), although no particular intervention was consistently effective at nine‐month follow‐up or later. In addition, data from five out of six studies supported the utility of adding voucher‐based incentives for cannabis‐negative urines to enhance treatment effect on cannabis use frequency. A single study found contrasting results throughout a 12‐month follow‐up period, as post‐treatment outcomes related to overall reduction in cannabis use frequency favoured CBT alone without the addition of abstinence‐based or treatment adherence‐based contingency management. In contrast, evidence of drug counselling, social support, relapse prevention and mindfulness meditation was weak because identified studies were few, information on treatment outcomes insufficient and rates of treatment adherence low. In line with treatments for other substance use, abstinence rates were relatively low overall, with approximately one‐quarter of participants abstinent at final follow‐up. Finally, three studies found that intervention was comparable with treatment as usual among participants in psychiatric clinics and reported no between‐group differences in any of the included outcomes.
