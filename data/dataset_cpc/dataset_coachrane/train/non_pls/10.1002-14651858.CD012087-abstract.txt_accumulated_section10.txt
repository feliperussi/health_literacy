Background
Chronic back pain is an important health problem. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat people with low back pain, especially people with acute back pain. Short term NSAID use is also recommended for pain relief in people with chronic back pain. Two types of NSAIDs are available and used to treat back pain: non‐selective NSAIDs and selective COX‐2 NSAIDs. In 2008, a Cochrane review identified a small but significant effect from NSAIDs compared to placebo in people with chronic back pain. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2008 and focuses on people with chronic low back pain. 
Objectives
To determine if NSAIDs are more efficacious than various comparison treatments for non‐specific chronic low back pain and if so, which type of NSAID is most efficacious. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German or Dutch. We also screened references cited in relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs (double‐blind and single‐blind) of NSAIDs used to treat people with chronic low back pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion in this Cochrane review according to the inclusion criteria. One review author extracted the data, and a second review author checked the data. Two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias of all included trials. If data were clinically homogeneous, we performed a meta‐analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
