Background
Despite its proven efficacy in improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations, many patients with asthma are not fully adherent to their steroid inhaler. Suboptimal adherence leads to poorer clinical outcomes and increased health service utilisation, and has been identified as a contributing factor to a third of asthma deaths in the UK. Reasons for non‐adherence vary, and a variety of interventions have been proposed to help people improve treatment adherence. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroids among people with asthma. 
Search methods
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 18 November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel and cluster randomised controlled trials of any duration conducted in any setting. We included studies reported as full‐text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. We included trials of adults and children with asthma and a current prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (as monotherapy or in combination with a long‐acting beta2‐agonist (LABA)). Eligible trials compared an intervention primarily aimed at improving adherence to ICS versus usual care or an alternative intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened the searches, extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were adherence to ICS, exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids and asthma control. We graded results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. 
We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all using a random‐effects model. We described skewed data narratively. We made no a priori assumptions about how trials would be categorised but conducted meta‐analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense. 
Main results
We included 39 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults and children with asthma, 28 of which (n = 16,303) contributed data to at least one meta‐analysis. Follow‐up ranged from two months to two years (median six months), and trials were conducted mainly in high‐income countries. Most studies reported some measure of adherence to ICS and a variety of other outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control. Studies generally were at low or unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of biases associated with blinding. We considered around half the studies to be at high risk for attrition bias and selective outcome reporting.
