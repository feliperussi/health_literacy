Background
Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly occurs in adult women, although it may also be seen in men and children. It primarily affects the genital area and around the anus, where it causes persistent itching and soreness. Scarring after inflammation may lead to severe damage by fusion of the vulval lips (labia); narrowing of the vaginal opening; and burying of the clitoris in women and girls, as well as tightening of the foreskin in men and boys, if treatments are not started early. Affected people have an increased risk of genital cancers. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of topical interventions for genital lichen sclerosus and adverse effects reported in included trials. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 16 September 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), LILACS (from 1982), CINAHL (from 1981), British Nursing Index and Archive (from 1985), Science Citation Index Expanded (from 1945), BIOSIS Previews (from 1926), Conference Papers Index (from 1982), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (from 1990). We also searched ongoing trial registries and scanned the bibliographies of included studies, published reviews, and papers that had cited the included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical interventions in genital lichen sclerosus.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion. 
Main results
We included 7 RCTs, with a total of 249 participants, covering 6 treatments. Six of these RCTs tested the efficacy of one active intervention against placebo or another active intervention, while the other trial tested three active interventions against placebo. 
When compared to placebo in one trial, clobetasol propionate 0.05% was effective in treating genital lichen sclerosus in relation to the following outcomes: 'participant‐rated improvement or remission of symptoms' (risk ratio (RR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 5.61) and 'investigator‐rated global degree of improvement' (standardised mean difference (SMD) 5.74, 95% CI 4.26 to 7.23). 
When mometasone furoate 0.05% was compared to placebo in another trial, there was a significant improvement in the 'investigator‐rated change in clinical grade of phimosis' (SMD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.77 to ‐0.31). 
Both trials found no significant differences in reported adverse drug reactions between the corticosteroid and placebo groups.  The data from four trials found no significant benefit for topical testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and progesterone. When used as maintenance therapy after an initial treatment with topical clobetasol propionate in another trial, topical testosterone worsened the symptoms (P < 0.05), but the placebo did not. 
One trial found no differences between pimecrolimus and clobetasol propionate in relieving symptoms through change in pruritus (itching) (SMD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.33) and burning/pain (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.62 to 0.69). However, pimecrolimus was less effective than clobetasol propionate with regard to the 'investigator‐rated global degree of improvement' (SMD ‐1.64, 95% CI ‐2.40 to ‐0.87). This trial found no significant differences in reported adverse drug reactions between the pimecrolimus and placebo groups.
