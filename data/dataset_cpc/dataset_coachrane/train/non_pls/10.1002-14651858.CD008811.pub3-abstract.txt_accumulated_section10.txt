Background
Age‐related cataract is the opacification of the lens, which occurs as a result of denaturation of lens proteins. Age‐related cataract remains the leading cause of blindness globally, except in the most developed countries. A key question is what is the best way of removing the lens, especially in lower income settings. 
Objectives
To compare two different techniques of lens removal in cataract surgery: manual small incision surgery (MSICS) and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to September 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to September 2014), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S), (January 1990 to September 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 23 September 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. Participants in the trials were people with age‐related cataract. We included trials where MSICS with a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implant was compared to ECCE with a posterior chamber IOL implant. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were collected independently by two authors. We aimed to collect data on presenting visual acuity 6/12 or better and best‐corrected visual acuity of less than 6/60 at three months and one year after surgery. Other outcomes included intraoperative complications, long‐term complications (one year or more after surgery), quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. There were not enough data available from the included trials to perform a meta‐analysis.
