All the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes. Overall, short‐term mortality was 30% and serious adverse events rate was 139 serious adverse events per 100 participants. The differences in short‐term mortality and proportion of people with serious adverse events were imprecise in all the comparisons. The number of serious adverse events and adverse events were fewer in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy (serious adverse events: rate ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.68; 88 participants; 1 study; adverse events: rate ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.68; 88 participants; 1 study). The proportion of people with organ failure and the mean costs were lower in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy (organ failure: OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60; 88 participants; 1 study; mean difference in costs: USD ‐11,922; P value < 0.05; 88 participants; 1 studies). There were more adverse events with video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach group compared to endoscopic‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach group (rate ratio 11.70, 95% CI 1.52 to 89.87; 22 participants; 1 study), but the number of interventions per participant was less with video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach group compared to endoscopic minimally invasive step‐up approach group (difference in medians: 2 procedures; P value < 0.05; 20 participants; 1 study). The differences in any of the other comparisons for number of serious adverse events, proportion of people with organ failure, number of adverse events, length of hospital stay, and intensive therapy unit stay were either imprecise or were not consistent. None of the trials reported long‐term mortality, infected pancreatic necrosis (trials that included participants with sterile necrosis), health‐related quality of life at any time frame, proportion of people with adverse events, requirement for additional invasive intervention, time to return to normal activity, and time to return to work.
