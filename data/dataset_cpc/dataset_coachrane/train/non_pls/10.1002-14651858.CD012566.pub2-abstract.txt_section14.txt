The included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in several domains, most‐notably across the domains of performance and detection bias due to the difficulty to blind those delivering the intervention or those assessing the outcome. Additionally, every outcome of interest was graded as low or very low certainty of evidence, primarily due to high risk of bias, as well as imprecision of the effect estimates and inconsistency between pooled data. For the outcome of absenteeism for any reason, the pooled estimate for rinse‐free hand washing was an IRR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.01; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), which indicates there may be little to no difference between groups. For absenteeism for any illness, the pooled IRR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.97; 6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), which indicates that rinse‐free hand washing may reduce absenteeism (13 days absent per 1000) compared to those in the 'no rinse‐free' group (16 days absent per 1000). For the outcome of absenteeism for acute respiratory illness, the pooled IRR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; 6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), which indicates that rinse‐free hand washing may reduce absenteeism (33 days absent per 1000) compared to those in the 'no rinse‐free' group (42 days absent per 1000). When evaluating absenteeism for acute gastrointestinal illness, the pooled estimate found an IRR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85; 4 studies; low‐certainty evidence), which indicates rinse‐free hand washing may reduce absenteeism (six days absent per 1000) compared to those in the 'no rinse‐free' group (eight days absent per 1000). There may be little to no difference between rinse‐free hand washing and 'no rinse‐free' group regarding adverse skin reactions with a RR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.32; 3 studies, 4365 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Broadly, compliance with the intervention appeared to range from moderate to high compliance (9 studies, 10,749 participants; very‐low certainty evidence); narrativley, no authors reported substantial issues with compliance. Overall, most studies that included data on perception reported that teachers and students perceived rinse‐free hand wash positively and were willing to continue its use (3 studies, 1229 participants; very‐low certainty evidence).
