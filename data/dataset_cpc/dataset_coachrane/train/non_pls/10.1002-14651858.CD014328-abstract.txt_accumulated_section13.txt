Background
Arthroscopic knee surgery remains a common treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including for degenerative meniscal tears, despite guidelines strongly recommending against its use. This Cochrane Review is an update of a non‐Cochrane systematic review published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery, including debridement, partial menisectomy or both, compared with placebo surgery or non‐surgical treatment in people with degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis, degenerative meniscal tears, or both). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 16 April 2021, unrestricted by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi‐randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing arthroscopic surgery with placebo surgery or non‐surgical interventions (e.g. exercise, injections, non‐arthroscopic lavage/irrigation, drug therapy, and supplements and complementary therapies) in people with symptomatic degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears or both). Major outcomes were pain, function, participant‐reported treatment success, knee‐specific quality of life, serious adverse events, total adverse events and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery for outcomes that measured benefits of surgery, but we combined data from all control groups to assess harms and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Main results
Sixteen trials (2105 participants) met our inclusion criteria. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and 56% of participants were women. Four trials (380 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery to placebo surgery. For the remaining trials, arthroscopic surgery was compared to exercise (eight trials, 1371 participants), a single intra‐articular glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 120 participants), non‐arthroscopic lavage (one trial, 34 participants), non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (one trial, 80 participants) and weekly hyaluronic acid injections for five weeks (one trial, 120 participants). The majority of trials without a placebo control were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (56%), performance (75%), detection (75%), attrition (44%) and selective reporting (75%) biases. The placebo‐controlled trials were less susceptible to bias and none were at risk of performance or detection bias. Here we limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo surgery. 
High‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery leads to little or no difference in pain or function at three months after surgery, moderate‐certainty evidence indicates there is probably little or no improvement in knee‐specific quality of life three months after surgery, and low‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery may lead to little or no difference in participant‐reported success at up to five years, compared with placebo surgery.
