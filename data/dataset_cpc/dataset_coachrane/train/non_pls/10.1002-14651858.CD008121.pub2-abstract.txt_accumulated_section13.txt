Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of 15% to 18%, which leads to considerable suffering and disability. Some antipsychotics have been reported to induce remission in major depression, when added to an antidepressant. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of second‐generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs (alone or augmentation) compared with placebo or antidepressants for people with MDD or dysthymia. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on clinicaltrials.gov and contacted key authors and drug companies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised, double‐blind trials comparing oral SGA treatment (alone or augmentation) with other forms of pharmaceutical treatment or placebo in people with MDD or dysthymia. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, and for continuous data the mean difference (MD), based on a random‐effects model. We presented each comparison separately; we did not perform a pooled data analysis. 
Main results
We included 28 trials with 8487 participants on five SGAs: amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone. 
Three studies (1092 participants) provided data on aripiprazole augmentation in MDD. All efficacy data (response n = 1092, three RCTs, OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63), (MADRS n = 1077, three RCTs, MD ‐3.04; 95% CI ‐4.09 to ‐2) indicated a benefit for aripiprazole but  more side effects (weight gain, EPS) .
