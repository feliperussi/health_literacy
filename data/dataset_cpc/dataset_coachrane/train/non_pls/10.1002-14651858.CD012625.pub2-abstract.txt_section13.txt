In very low certainty evidence relaxation techniques had uncertain effects on sleep quality and duration, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Studies were not designed to evaluate the effects of relaxation on sleep latency or hospitalisation. Exercise had uncertain effects on sleep quality (SMD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐2.26 to 0.05; I2 = 90%; 5 studies, 165 participants; very low certainty evidence). Exercise probably decreased depression (MD ‐9.05, 95% CI ‐13.72 to ‐4.39; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 46 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and fatigue (SMD ‐0.68, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.29; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Compared with no acupressure, acupressure had uncertain effects on sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale 0 ‐ 21) (MD ‐1.27, 95% CI ‐2.13 to ‐0.40; I2 = 89%; 6 studies, 367 participants: very low certainty evidence). Acupressure probably slightly improved sleep latency (scale 0 ‐ 3) (MD ‐0.59, 95% CI ‐0.92 to ‐0.27; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 173 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and sleep time (scale 0 ‐ 3) (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.12 to ‐0.09; I2 = 68%; 3 studies, 173 participants; moderate certainty evidence), although effects on sleep disturbance were uncertain as the evidence certainty was very low (scale 0 ‐ 3) (MD ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.16 to 0.19; I2 = 97%). In moderate certainty evidence, acupressure probably decrease fatigue (MD ‐1.07, 95% CI ‐1.67 to ‐0.48; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 137 participants). Acupressure had uncertain effects on depression (MD ‐3.65, 95% CI ‐7.63 to 0.33; I2 = 27%; 2 studies, 137 participants; very low certainty evidence) while studies were not designed to evaluate the effect of acupressure on HRQoL, anxiety, or hospitalisation. It was uncertain whether acupressure compared with sham acupressure improved sleep quality (PSQI scale 0 to 21) because the certainty of the evidence was very low (MD ‐2.25, 95% CI ‐6.33 to 1.82; I2 = 96%; 2 studies, 129 participants), but total sleep time may have been improved (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.73 to 0.04; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; low certainty evidence). 2 =2 =There were no studies designed to directly examine and/or correlate efficacy of any interventions aimed at improving sleep that may have been attempted for the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. No studies reported treatment effects for children. Adverse effects of therapies were very uncertain.
