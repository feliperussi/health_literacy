We included 14 weight loss studies with a total of 2537 participants, and four weight maintenance studies with a total of 1603 participants. Treatment duration was between four weeks and 30 months. At six months, computer‐based interventions led to greater weight loss than minimal interventions (mean difference (MD) ‐1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.1 to ‐0.9; two trials) but less weight loss than in‐person treatment (MD 2.1 kg; 95% CI 0.8 to 3.4; one trial). At six months, computer‐based interventions were superior to a minimal control intervention in limiting weight regain (MD ‐0.7 kg; 95% CI ‐1.2 to ‐0.2; two trials), but not superior to infrequent in‐person treatment (MD 0.5 kg; 95% ‐0.5 to 1.6; two trials). We did not observe consistent differences in dietary or physical activity behaviors between intervention and control groups in either weight loss or weight maintenance trials. Three weight loss studies estimated the costs of computer‐based interventions compared to usual care, however two of the studies were 11 and 28 years old, and recent advances in technology render these estimates unlikely to be applicable to current or future interventions, while the third study was conducted in active duty military personnel, and it is unclear whether the costs are relevant to other settings. One weight loss study reported the cost‐effectiveness ratio for a weekly in‐person weight loss intervention relative to a computer‐based intervention as USD 7177 (EUR 5678) per life year gained (80% CI USD 3055 to USD 60,291 (EUR 2417 to EUR 47,702)). It is unclear whether this could be extrapolated to other studies. No data were identified on adverse events, morbidity, complications or health‐related quality of life.
