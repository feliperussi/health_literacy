Compared with no exercise, water‐based exercise training improved the six‐minute walk distance (mean difference (MD) 62 metres; 95% confidence interval (CI) 44 to 80 metres; three studies; 99 participants; moderate quality evidence), the incremental shuttle walk distance (MD 50 metres; 95% CI 20 to 80 metres; one study; 30 participants; high quality evidence) and the endurance shuttle walk distance (MD 371 metres; 95% CI 121 to 621 metres; one study; 30 participants; high quality evidence). Quality of life was also improved after water‐based exercise training compared with no exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.97, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐1.57; two studies; 49 participants; low quality evidence). Compared with land‐based exercise training, water‐based exercise training did not significantly change the six‐minute walk distance (MD 11 metres; 95% CI ‐11 to 33 metres; three studies; 62 participants; moderate quality evidence) or the incremental shuttle walk distance (MD 9 metres; 95% CI ‐15 to 34 metres; two studies; 59 participants; low quality evidence). However, the endurance shuttle walk distance improved following water‐based exercise training compared with land‐based exercise training (MD 313 metres; 95% CI 232 to 394 metres; two studies; 59 participants; moderate quality evidence). No significant differences were found between water‐based exercise training and land‐based exercise training for quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire or by three of four domains of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ); however, the fatigue domain of the CRDQ showed a statistically significant difference in favour of water‐based exercise (MD ‐3.00; 95% CI ‐5.26 to ‐0.74; one study; 30 participants). Only one study reported long‐term outcomes after water‐based exercise training for quality of life and body composition, and no significant change was observed between baseline results and six‐month follow‐up results. One minor adverse event was reported for water‐based exercise training (based on reporting from two studies; 20 participants). Impact of disease severity could not be examined because data were insufficient.
