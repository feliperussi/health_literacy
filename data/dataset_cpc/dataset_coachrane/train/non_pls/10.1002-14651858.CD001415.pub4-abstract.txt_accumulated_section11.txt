Background
This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2018.
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Most people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug, but up to 30% develop drug‐resistant epilepsy, especially people with focal seizures. In this review, we summarised the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of gabapentin, when used as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin when used as an add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Search methods
For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid) on 11 August 2020. CRS Web includes randomised or quasi‐randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, add‐on trials of gabapentin in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. We also included trials using an active drug control group or comparing different doses of gabapentin. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal (any reason) and adverse effects. Primary analyses were intention‐to‐treat. We also undertook sensitivity best‐case and worst‐case analyses. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome and evaluated dose‐response in regression models.
