The results provide evidence that group‐based parenting programmes reduce overall emotional and behavioural problems (SMD ‐0.81, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.25; 5 studies, 280 participants, low quality evidence) based on total parent‐reported data assessed at postintervention. This result was not, however, maintained when two quasi‐RCTs were removed as part of a sensitivity analysis (SMD ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐1.43 to 0.09; 3 studies, 221 participants). The results of data from subscales show evidence of reduced total externalising problems (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.01; 8 studies, 989 participants, moderate quality evidence). Single study results show very low quality evidence of reductions in externalising problems hyperactivity‐inattention subscale (SMD ‐1.34; 95% CI ‐2.37 to ‐0.31; 19 participants), low quality evidence of no effect on total internalising problems (SMD 0.34; 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.81; 73 participants), and very low quality evidence of an increase in social skills (SMD 3.59; 95% CI 2.42 to 4.76; 32 participants), based on parent‐reported data assessed at postintervention. Results for secondary outcomes, which were also measured using subscales, show an impact on parent‐child interaction in terms of reduced negative behaviour (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.06; 7 studies, 941 participants, moderate quality evidence), and improved positive behaviour (SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.79; 4 studies, 173 participants, moderate quality evidence) as rated by independent observers postintervention. No further meta‐analyses were possible. Results of subgroup analyses show no evidence for treatment duration (seven weeks or less versus more than eight weeks) and inconclusive evidence for prevention versus treatment interventions.
