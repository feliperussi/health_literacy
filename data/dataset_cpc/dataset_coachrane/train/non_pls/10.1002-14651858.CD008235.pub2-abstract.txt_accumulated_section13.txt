Background
Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder that is characterized predominantly by a low platelet count. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists increase production of platelets by stimulating the TPO receptor in people with chronic ITP. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of TPO receptor agonists in chronic ITP patients.
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (from 1950 to March 2011), EMBASE (from 1974 to March 2011), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3) to identify all randomized trials in chronic ITP. We also contacted authors of included studies and TPO receptor agonists manufacturers. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TPO receptor agonists alone, or in combination with other drugs, to placebo, no treatment, other drugs, splenectomy or another TPO receptor agonist in patients with chronic ITP. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. 
Main results
Six trials with 808 patients were included. Five studies compared TPO receptor agonists with placebo (romiplostim: 100, eltrombopag: 299, placebo: 175); one study compared TPO receptor agonists with standard of care (SOC) (romiplostim: 157; SOC: 77). SOC included a variety of therapies, such as glucocorticoid, anti‚ÄêD immune globulin, intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, azathioprine, and so on. Overall survival, one of our primary outcomes, was not studied by these RCTs and we could not estimate number needed to treat (NNT). Another primary outcome, improving significant bleeding events, did not reveal any significant differences between the TPO receptor agonists group and the control group (placebo or SOC) (versus placebo risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 1.15; versus SOC RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.63). 
For secondary outcomes, TPO receptor agonists statistically significantly improved overall platelet response (versus placebo RR 4.06, 95% CI 2.93 to 5.63; versus SOC RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.37), complete response (versus placebo RR 9.29, 95% CI 2.32 to 37.15) and durable response (versus placebo RR 14.16, 95% CI 2.91 to 69.01). There was a significant reduction in overall bleeding events (WHO grades 1 to 4) when compared to placebo (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), but not when compared to SOC(RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.26).
