Four trials presenting data for 264 children aged 4 to 12 years made this comparison. Low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) showed children had very similar function assessed using the RAND health status score at two years after surgery (external fixation) compared with conservative treatment (spica cast): mean 69 versus 68. The other three trials did not report on function. There was moderate quality evidence (four trials, 264 children, aged 4 to 12 years, followed up 3 to 24 months) that surgery reduced the risk of malunion (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.59, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 115 malunions per 1000 in children treated conservatively, these data equate to 81 fewer (95% CI 47 to 97 fewer) malunions per 1000 in surgically‚Äêtreated children. Conversely, low quality evidence indicated that there were more serious adverse events such as infections after surgery (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.17, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 40 serious adverse events per 1000 for conservative treatment, these data equate to 56 more (95% CI 4 to 167 more) serious adverse events per 1000 children treated surgically. There was low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) of similar satisfaction levels in children and parents with surgery involving external fixation and plaster cast only. However, there was low quality evidence (one trial, 46 children) that more parents were satisfied with intramedullary nailing than with traction followed by a cast, and that surgery reduced the time taken off from school.
