Background
Dietary advice is the main strategy for managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It remains unclear what type of advice is best. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM for improving health outcomes for women and babies. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (8 March 2016), PSANZ's Trials Registry (22 March 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Evidence quality for two comparisons was assessed using GRADE, for primary outcomes for the mother: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; caesarean section; type 2 diabetes mellitus; and child: large‐for‐gestational age; perinatal mortality; neonatal mortality or morbidity composite; neurosensory disability; secondary outcomes for the mother: induction of labour; perineal trauma; postnatal depression; postnatal weight retention or return to pre‐pregnancy weight; and child: hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood adiposity; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Main results
In this update, we included 19 trials randomising 1398 women with GDM, at an overall unclear to moderate risk of bias (10 comparisons). For outcomes assessed using GRADE, downgrading was based on study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Where no findings are reported below for primary outcomes or pre‐specified GRADE outcomes, no data were provided by included trials. 
Primary outcomes  
Low‐moderate glycaemic index (GI) versus moderate‐high GI diet (four trials):  no clear differences observed for: large‐for‐gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.34; two trials, 89 infants; low‐quality evidence); severe hypertension or pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.86; one trial, 95 women; very low‐quality evidence); eclampsia (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14; one trial, 83 women; very low‐quality evidence) or caesarean section (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; one trial, 63 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Energy‐restricted versus no energy‐restricted diet (three trials):  no clear differences seen for: large‐for‐gestational age (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.12; one trial, 123 infants; low‐quality evidence); perinatal mortality (no events; two trials, 423 infants; low‐quality evidence); pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.97; one trial, 117 women; low‐quality evidence); or caesarean section (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.56; two trials, 420 women; low‐quality evidence). 
DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet versus control diet (three trials):  no clear differences observed for: pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.26; three trials, 136 women); however there were fewer caesarean sections in the DASH diet group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76; two trials, 86 women). 
Low‐carbohydrate versus high‐carbohydrate diet (two trials):  no clear differences seen for: large‐for‐gestational age (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.95; one trial, 149 infants); perinatal mortality (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.49; one trial, 150 infants); maternal hypertension (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.22; one trial, 150 women); or caesarean section (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.99; two trials, 179 women).
