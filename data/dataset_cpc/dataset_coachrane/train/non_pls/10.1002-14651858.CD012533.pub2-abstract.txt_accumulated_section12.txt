Background
Maintaining care for ill persons in the community is heavily dependent on support from unpaid caregivers. Many caregivers, however, find themselves in a caring role for which they are ill prepared and may require professional support. The telephone is an easily accessible method of providing support irrespective of geographical location. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone support interventions, delivered by healthcare professionals, when compared to usual care or non‐telephone‐based support interventions for providing education and psychosocial support for informal caregivers of people with acute and chronic diagnosed illnesses, and to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of telephone interventions in this population. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to 16 November 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I; and CINAHL Complete. We also searched 11 caregiver‐specific websites, three conference links, and two clinical trial registries. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We excluded cross‐over trials because of the high risk of carry‐over effects from one intervention to another. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened citations against the review's inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The review's prespecified primary (quality of life and burden) and secondary outcomes (skill acquisition, psychological health, knowledge, health status and well‐being, family functioning, satisfaction, and economic outcomes), where reported, were assessed at the end of intervention delivery and at short‐term (≤ 3 months), medium‐term (> 3 to ≤ 6 months) and longer‐term time points (> 6 to 12 months) following the intervention. Where possible, meta‐analyses were conducted, otherwise results were reported narratively. 
Main results
We included 21 randomised studies involving 1,690 caregivers; 19 studies compared telephone support interventions and usual care, of which 18 contributed data to the analyses. Two studies compared telephone and non‐telephone professional support interventions. Caregiver ages ranged from 19 years to 87 years across studies. The majority of participants were female (> 70.53%), with two trials including females only. Most caregivers were family members, educated beyond secondary or high school level or had the equivalent in years of education. All caregivers were based in the community. Overall risk of bias was high for most studies.
