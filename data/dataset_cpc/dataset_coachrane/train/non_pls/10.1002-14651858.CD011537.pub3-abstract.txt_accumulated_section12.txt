Background
Most women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment will reach the stage of embryo transfer (ET), but the proportion of embryos that can be successfully implanted after ET has remained small since the mid‐1990s. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone that is synthesised and released by the syncytiotrophoblast and has a fundamental role in embryo implantation and the early stages of pregnancy. Intrauterine administration of hCG via ET catheter during a mock procedure around the time of ET is a novel approach that has been suggested to improve the outcomes of assisted reproduction. 
Objectives
To investigate whether intrauterine (intracavity) administration of hCG (IC‐hCG) around the time of ET improves clinical outcomes in subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We performed searches on 9 January 2018 using Cochrane methods.
Selection criteria
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IC‐hCG around the time of ET, irrespective of language and country of origin. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data from studies, and attempted to contact study authors when data were missing. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5. We assessed evidence quality using GRADE methods. Primary outcomes were live birth and miscarriage; secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate and complications. 
Main results
Seventeen RCTs investigated the effects of IC‐hCG administration for 4751 subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction. IC‐hCG was administered in variable doses at different times before the ET. hCG was obtained from the urine of pregnant women or from cell cultures using recombinant DNA technology.
