Background
Low systemic blood flow (SBF) is common in extremely premature infants in the first day after birth and has been associated with peri / intraventricular haemorrhage (PIVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), mortality and developmental impairment. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of specific inotropes on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants with low systemic blood flow 
Search methods
Updated searches were made of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (1980 to May 2010) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2010), supplemented by searches of abstracts of conference proceedings, citations of reviews and expert informants. 
Selection criteria
Random and quasi‐random controlled trials of inotropes enrolling preterm infants with low systemic or organ blood flow in the neonatal period. 
Data collection and analysis
Independent assessment of trial eligibility, quality and data extraction by each review author. 
Main results
No new studies were found in updated search. No studies that compared an inotrope to no treatment in preterm infants with low SBF were found. One study compared dobutamine versus dopamine in preterm infants with low SVC flow. The study was of adequate methodology. No significant difference was reported in mortality to discharge, PIVH, grade 3 or 4 PIVH or NEC. At three years, there was no significant difference in cerebral palsy, deafness, developmental quotient > 2 sd below norm or combined disability. Surviving infants treated with dobutamine had a significantly higher development quotient. There was no significant difference in death or disability at the latest time reported (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66, 1.38). For secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference in periventricular leucomalacia, renal impairment, pulmonary haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity or CLD at 36 weeks. There was no significant difference in treatment failure. Dobutamine produced a significantly greater increase in SVC flow at the highest dose reached, whereas dopamine produced a significantly greater increase in mean BP.
