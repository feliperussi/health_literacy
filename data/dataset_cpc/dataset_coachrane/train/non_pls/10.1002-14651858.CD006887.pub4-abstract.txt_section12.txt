We identified 41 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 194,035 participants from 6422 reports. We assessed studies as having high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. Low‐quality evidence evidence suggests that providing CVD risk scores may have little or no effect on CVD events compared with usual care (5.4% versus 5.3%; RR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 25%; 3 trials, N = 99,070). Providing CVD risk scores may reduce CVD risk factor levels by a small amount compared with usual care. Providing CVD risk scores reduced total cholesterol (MD −0.10 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.00; I² = 94%; 12 trials, N = 20,437, low‐quality evidence), systolic blood pressure (MD −2.77 mmHg, 95% CI −4.16 to −1.38; I² = 93%; 16 trials, N = 32,954, low‐quality evidence), and multivariable CVD risk (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.02; I² = 94%; 9 trials, N = 9549, low‐quality evidence). Providing CVD risk scores may reduce adverse events compared with usual care, but results were imprecise (1.9% versus 2.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.04; I² = 0%; 4 trials, N = 4630, low‐quality evidence). Compared with usual care, providing CVD risk scores may increase new or intensified lipid‐lowering medications (15.7% versus 10.7%; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.87; I² = 40%; 11 trials, N = 14,175, low‐quality evidence) and increase new or increased antihypertensive medications (17.2% versus 11.4%; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.11; I² = 53%; 8 trials, N = 13,255, low‐quality evidence).
