Background
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) last for less than 30 days and are the most common acute diseases affecting people. Exercise has been shown to improve health generally, but it is uncertain whether exercise may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity, and duration of ARIs. This is an update of our review published in 2015. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity, or duration of acute respiratory infections. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to March week 1, 2020), Embase (1974 to 05 March 2020), CINAHL (1981 to 05 March 2020), LILACS (1982 to 05 March 2020), SPORTDiscus (1985 to 05 March 2020), PEDro (searched 05 March 2020), OTseeker (searched 05 March 2020), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 05 March 2020). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (method of allocation that is not truly random, e.g. based on date of birth, medical record number) of exercise for ARIs in the general population. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using a standard form. One review author entered data, which a second review author checked. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. There were sufficient differences in the populations trialed and in the nature of the interventions to use the random‐effects model (which makes fewer assumptions than the fixed‐effect model) in the analysis. 
Main results
We included three new trials for this update (473 participants) for a total of 14 trials involving 1377 adults, published between 1990 and 2018. Nine trials were conducted in the USA, and one each in Brazil, Canada, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. 
Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 419 participants, aged from 18 to 85 years. The proportion of female participants ranged from 52% to 100%. Follow‐up duration ranged from 1 to 36 weeks (median = 12 weeks). 
Moderate‐intensity aerobic exercise (walking, bicycling, treadmill, or a combination) was evaluated in 11 trials, and was most commonly prescribed at least three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes.
