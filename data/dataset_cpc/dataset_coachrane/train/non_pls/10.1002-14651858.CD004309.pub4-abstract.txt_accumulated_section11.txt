Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in Issue 2, 2009, and updated in Issue 4, 2012. 
Etoricoxib is a selective cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) inhibitor licensed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain in some jurisdictions. This class of drugs is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of single dose etoricoxib for acute postoperative pain using methods that permit accurate comparison with other analgesics evaluated in the same way, using criteria of efficacy recommended by in‐depth studies at the individual patient level. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of articles. The date of the most recent search was 31 January 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials of single dose, oral etoricoxib for acute postoperative pain in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants prescribed etoricoxib or placebo with at least 50% pain relief over six hours, using validated equations. We calculated relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse events.
