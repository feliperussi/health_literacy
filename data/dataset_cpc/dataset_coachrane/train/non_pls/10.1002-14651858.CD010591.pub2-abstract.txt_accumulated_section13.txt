Background
There are many forms of rhinitis. Patients are diagnosed with non‐allergic rhinitis when anatomic, infectious and allergic aetiologies have been excluded. The symptoms, including nasal congestion, blockage or obstruction, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing and, less frequently, nasal itching, can range from mild to debilitating. It affects between 25% and 50% of patients with rhinitis. Several medications are widely used in the treatment of non‐allergic rhinitis, including oral and topical nasal antihistamines, intranasal and (rarely) systemic corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, delivered intranasally, is considered a treatment option for non‐allergic rhinitis. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of non‐allergic rhinitis compared with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or two or more of the above therapies in combination, or different capsaicin regimens. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 24 June 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials in adult patients with non‐allergic rhinitis comparing intranasal capsaicin with no therapy, placebo or other topical or systemic medications, or their combinations. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included four studies (five publications) involving 302 participants with idiopathic non‐allergic rhinitis. All the included studies described patients with moderately severe, idiopathic non‐allergic rhinitis who were between the ages of 16 and 65. Studies had follow‐up periods ranging from four to 38 weeks. The overall risk of bias in the studies was either high or unclear (two studies had overall high risk of bias, while two others had low to unclear risk of bias). Using the GRADE system we assessed the evidence as being of low to moderate quality. A meta‐analysis was not possible, given lack of similarity of the reported outcomes. 
Two studies compared capsaicin with placebo. One study reported that capsaicin resulted in an improvement of overall nasal symptoms (a primary outcome) measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 10. There was a mean difference (MD) of ‐3.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.24 to ‐1.44), MD ‐3.73 (95% CI ‐5.45 to ‐2.01) and MD ‐3.52 (95% CI ‐5.55 to ‐1.48) at two, 12 and 36 weeks post‐treatment, respectively. Another study reported that, compared to placebo, capsaicin (at 4 µg/puff) was more likely to produce overall symptom resolution (reduction in nasal blockage, sneezing/itching/coughing and nasal secretion measured with a daily record chart) at four weeks post‐treatment (a primary outcome). The risk ratio (RR) was 3.17 (95% CI 1.38 to 7.29).
