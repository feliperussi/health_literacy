We included 11 randomised controlled trials of 27,945 participants. Three studies tested oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), while eight tested oral factor Xa inhibitors (four rivaroxaban, two apixaban and two edoxaban). We deemed all included studies to be of high methodological quality and generally low risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was generally graded as high as the outcomes were direct and effect estimates were consistent and precise, as reflected in the narrow CIs around the ORs. Meta‐analysis of three studies (7596 participants) comparing oral DTIs with standard anticoagulation groups showed no difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.49), recurrent DVT (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58), fatal PE (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.70), non‐fatal PE (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.90) or all‐cause mortality ((OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.15). However, oral DTIs were associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98). Meta‐analysis of eight studies (16,356 participants) comparing oral factor Xa inhibitors with standard anticoagulation demonstrated a similar rate of recurrent VTE between the two treatments (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07). Oral factor Xa inhibitors were associated with a lower rate of recurrent DVT (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98). However, this was a weak association, heavily dependent on one study. The rate of fatal (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.03), non‐fatal PE (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28) and all‐cause mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11) was similar between the two treatment groups. Oral factor Xa inhibitors were also associated with reduced bleeding (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.76). None of the included studies measured post‐thrombotic syndrome or health‐related quality of life.
