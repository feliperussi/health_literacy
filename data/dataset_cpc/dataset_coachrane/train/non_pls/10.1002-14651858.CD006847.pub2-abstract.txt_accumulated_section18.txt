Background
The role of gefitinib for the treatment of advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is evolving. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence from all randomised trials. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib as first‐line, second‐line or maintenance treatment for advanced NSCLC. 
Search methods
We performed searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 17 February 2017. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, clinical trial registries and references lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included trials assessing gefitinib, alone or in combination with other treatment, compared to placebo or other treatments in the first‐ or successive‐line treatment of patients with NSCLC, excluding compassionate use. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard Cochrane methodology. Two authors independently assessed the search results to select those with sound methodological quality. We carried out all analyses on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We recorded the following outcome data: overall survival, progression‐free survival, toxicity, tumour response and quality of life. We also collected data for the following subgroups: Asian ethnicity and positive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. 
Main results
We included 35 eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which examined 12,089 patients. 
General population 
Gefitinib did not statistically improve overall survival when compared with placebo or chemotherapy in either first‐ or second‐line settings. Second‐line gefitinib prolonged time to treatment failure (TTF) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.90, P < 0.0001) when compared with placebo. Maintenance gefitinib improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91, P = 0.007) after first‐line therapy. 
Studies in patients of Asian ethnicity or that conducted subgroup analyses 
Second‐line gefitinib prolonged overall survival over placebo (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P = 0.01). In the first‐line setting, progression‐free survival was improved with gefitinib over chemotherapy alone (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.98, P = 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Gefitinib given in combination with a chemotherapy regimen improved progression‐free survival versus either gefitinib alone or chemotherapy alone (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96, P = 0.03; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.77, P < 0.00001, respectively). In the second‐line setting, progression‐free survival was superior in patients given gefitinib over placebo or chemotherapy (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91, P = 0.009; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88, P = 0.002; moderate quality of evidence, respectively). Combining gefitinib with chemotherapy in the second‐line setting was superior to gefitinib alone (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, P = 0.04). As maintenance therapy, gefitinib improved progression‐free survival when compared with placebo (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.54, P < 0.00001). 
Patients with EGFR mutation‐positive tumours 
Studies in patients with EGFR mutation‐positive tumours showed an improvement in progression‐free survival in favour of gefitinib over first‐line and second‐line chemotherapy (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61, P < 0.00001; HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47, P < 0.0001, respectively). Gefitinib as maintenance therapy following chemotherapy improved overall and progression‐free survival (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98, P = 0.05; HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, P < 0.0001, respectively) in one phase III study when compared to placebo.
