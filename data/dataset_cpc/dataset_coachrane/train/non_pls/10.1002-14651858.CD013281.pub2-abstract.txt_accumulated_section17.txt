Background
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in individuals with mental disorders. Much of the burden of disease falls on the populations of low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pharmacological, behaviour change, and organisational interventions versus active and non‐active comparators in the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes among people with mental illness in LMICs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and six other databases, as well as three international trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. Searches are current up to 20 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological, behavioural or organisational interventions targeting the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes in adults with mental disorders in LMICs. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors working independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments. We conducted meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. 
Main results
One hospital‐based RCT with 150 participants (99 participants with schizophrenia) addressed our review's primary outcome of prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes onset. Low‐certainty evidence from this study did not show a difference between atypical and typical antipsychotics in the development of diabetes at six weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 7.05) (among a total 99 participants with schizophrenia, 68 were in atypical and 31 were in typical antipsychotic groups; 55 participants without mental illness were not considered in the analysis). 
An additional 29 RCTs with 2481 participants assessed one or more of the review's secondary outcomes. All studies were conducted in hospital settings and reported on pharmacological interventions. One study, which we could not include in our meta‐analysis, included an intervention with pharmacological and behaviour change components. We identified no studies of organisational interventions. 
Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there may be no difference between the use of atypical and typical antipsychotics for the outcomes of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.69; two studies with 144 participants), and fasting blood glucose levels (mean difference (MD) 0.05 lower, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.00; two studies with 211 participants). Participants who receive typical antipsychotics may have a lower body mass index (BMI) at follow‐up than participants who receive atypical antipsychotics (MD 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.81; two studies with 141 participants; moderate certainty of evidence), and may have lower total cholesterol levels eight weeks after starting treatment (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.43; one study with 112 participants). 
There was moderate certainty evidence suggesting no difference between the use of metformin and placebo for the outcomes of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 16.35; three studies with 158 participants). There was moderate‐to‐high certainty evidence of no difference between metformin and placebo for fasting blood glucose levels (endpoint data: MD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.11; change from baseline data: MD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.22; five studies with 264 participants). There was high certainty evidence that BMI was lower for participants receiving metformin compared with those receiving a placebo (MD ‐1.37, 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.70; five studies with 264 participants; high certainty of evidence). There was no difference between metformin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
Low‐certainty evidence from one study (48 participants) suggests there may be no difference between the use of melatonin and placebo for the outcome of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.66). Fasting blood glucose is probably reduced more in participants treated with melatonin compared with placebo (endpoint data: MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.01; change from baseline data: MD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.09; three studies with 202 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between melatonin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one study (25 participants) suggests that drop‐outs may be higher in participants treated with a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) compared with those receiving a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.01). It is uncertain if there is no difference in fasting blood glucose levels between these groups (MD ‐0.39, 95% CI ‐0.88 to 0.10; three studies with 141 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is no difference in BMI and depression between the TCA and SSRI antidepressant groups.
