Background
Pulmonary disease continues to be the major cause of mortality and morbidity in very low birth weight infants. Chronic lung disease (CLD) following mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is still a problem despite increased use of antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement therapy. Immaturity, barotrauma, volutrauma and oxygen toxicity are thought to be important factors in the cause of CLD. There is some evidence from animal and adult human studies that adequate ventilation can be achieved at lower pressures when using high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV, about 200‐400 breaths per minute) compared to conventional ventilation (CV, 30‐80 breaths per minute). 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether the elective (commencing soon after initiation of mechanical ventilation) use of high frequency jet ventilation, as compared to conventional ventilation in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), would decrease the incidence of chronic lung disease without adverse effects. 
Search methods
Randomized trials from MEDLINE were identified by means of MeSH and text words 'high frequency ventilation', 'high frequency jet ventilation', 'jet ventilation' from the years 1980 to October 2002. The EMBASE database (1982‐2002), the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Neonatal Trials Register of the Neonatal Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2002) were also accessed. 
Selection criteria
All randomized controlled trials of elective high frequency jet ventilation versus conventional ventilation in preterm infants born at less than 35 weeks GA or with a birth weight less than 2000 gms with respiratory distress were included in the systematic review. Trials which used HFJV to 'rescue' preterm infants due to severe respiratory distress usually beyond 24 hours, and trials that used HFJV for a mandatory time period and then switched back to CV, were not included in this review. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard methods of the Neonatal Cochrane Review Group were used, including independent trial assessment and data extraction. Data were analysed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) for benefits and number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse outcomes were calculated. 
Main results
Overall analysis of the three trials showed that HFJV is associated with a reduction in CLD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age in survivors [RR 0.58 (0.34, 0.98), RD ‐0.138 (‐0.268, ‐0.007), NNT 7 (4, 90)]. The use of home oxygen therapy was evaluated in only one study (Keszler 1997) and a lower rate was found in the HFJV group [RR 0.24 (0.07, 0.79), RD ‐0.176 (‐0.306, ‐0.047), NNT 5 (3, 21)]. Overall there was a trend towards an increase in the risk of PVL in the HFJV group, which was not significant. Subgroup analyses shows a significant increase in risk of PVL in the trial by Wiswell 1996 [RR 5.0 (1.19, 21.04), RD 0.250 (0.069, 0.431), NNH 4.0 (2.3,14.5)] where a 'low volume strategy' was the standard protocol for HFJV. In the other trial by Keszler 1997, where the intention was to use a 'high volume strategy', there was no significant difference in the incidence of PVL, RR 0.42 (0.14, 1.30).
