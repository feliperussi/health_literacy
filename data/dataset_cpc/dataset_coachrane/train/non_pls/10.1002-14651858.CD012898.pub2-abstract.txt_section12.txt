We included 12 studies (n = 1837), of which, three compared PCT to a wait‐list/minimal attention (WL/MA) group and 11 compared PCT to TF‐CBT. PCT was more effective than WL/MA in reducing PTSD symptom severity (SMD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐1.10 to ‐0.59; participants = 290; studies = 3; I² = 0%). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. The results of the non‐inferiority analysis comparing PCT to TF‐CBT did not support PCT non‐inferiority, with the 95% confidence interval surpassing the clinically meaningful cut‐off (MD 6.83, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.76; 6 studies, n = 607; I² = 42%). We assessed this quality of evidence as low. CAPS differences between PCT and TF‐CBT attenuated at 6‐month (MD 1.59, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 3.63; participants = 906; studies = 6; I² = 0%) and 12‐month (MD 1.22, 95% CI ‐2.17 to 4.61; participants = 485; studies = 3; I² = 0%) follow‐up periods. To confirm the direction of the treatment effect using all eligible trials, we also evaluated PTSD SMD differences. These results were consistent with the primary MD outcomes, with meaningful effect size differences between PCT and TF‐CBT at post‐treatment (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56; participants = 1129; studies = 9), but smaller effect size differences at six months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29; participants = 1339; studies = 9) and 12 months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31; participants = 728; studies = 5). PCT had approximately 14% lower treatment dropout rates compared to TF‐CBT (RD ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.10; participants = 1542; studies = 10). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. There was no evidence of meaningful differences on self‐reported PTSD (MD 4.50, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.90; participants = 983; studies = 7) or depression symptoms (MD 1.78, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 3.78; participants = 705; studies = 5) post‐treatment.
