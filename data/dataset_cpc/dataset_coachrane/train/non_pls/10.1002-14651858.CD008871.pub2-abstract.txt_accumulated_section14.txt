Background
Localized prostate cancer is a slow growing tumor for many years for the majority of affected men. Low‐dose rate brachytherapy (LDR‐BT) is short‐distance radiotherapy using low‐energy radioactive sources. LDR‐BT has been recommended for men with low risk localized prostate cancer. 
Objectives
To assess the benefit and harm of LDR‐BT compared to radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and no primary therapy (NPT) in men with localized prostatic cancer. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1950), and EMBASE (from 1980) were searched in June 2010 as well as online trials registers and reference lists of reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomized, controlled trials comparing LDR‐BT versus RP, EBRT, and NPT in men with clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Data on study methods, participants, treatment regimens, observation period and outcomes were recorded by two reviewers independently. 
Main results
We identified only one RCT (N = 200; mean follow up 68 months). This trial compared LDR‐BT and RP. The risk of bias was deemed high. Primary outcomes (overall survival, cause‐specific mortality, or metastatic‐free survival) were not reported. Biochemical recurrence‐free survival at 5 years follow up was not significantly different between LDR‐BT (78/85 (91.8%)) and RP (81/89 (91.0%)); P = 0.875; relative risk 0.92 (95% CI: 0.35 to 2.42). 
For severe adverse events reported at 6 months follow up, results favored LDR‐BT for urinary incontinence (LDR‐BT 0/85 (0.0%) versus RP 16/89 (18.0%); P < 0.001; relative risk 0) and favored RP for urinary irritation (LDR‐BT 68/85 (80.0%) versus RP 4/89 (4.5%); P < 0.001; relative risk 17.80, 95% CI 6.79 to 46.66). The occurrence of urinary stricture did not significantly differ between the treatment groups (LDR‐BT 2/85 (2.4%) versus RP 6/89 (6.7%); P = 0.221; relative risk 0.35, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.68). Long‐term information was not available. 
We did not identify significant differences of mean scores between treatment groups for patient‐reported outcomes function and bother as well as generic health‐related quality of life.
