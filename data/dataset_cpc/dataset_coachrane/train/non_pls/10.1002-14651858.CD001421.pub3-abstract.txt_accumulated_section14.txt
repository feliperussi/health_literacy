Background
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the most common pre‐malignant lesion. Surgical treatments for CIN are commonly associated with blood loss. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions for preventing blood loss during the treatment of CIN. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL up to November 2012. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vasopressin, tranexamic acid, haemostatic sutures, Amino‐Cerv or Monsel's solution in women undergoing surgery for CIN. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Risk ratios comparing adverse events in women who received one of the interventions were pooled in a random‐effects meta‐analyses or included in single trial analyses. 
Main results
Twelve RCTs (N = 1602, of whom 1512 were assessed) were included.
Vasopressin significantly reduced perioperative bleeding (mean difference (MD) = ‐100.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐129.48 to ‐72.12) and was associated with a decreased risk of bleeding that required haemostatic sutures or further vasopressin, compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.39, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.56). 
Tranexamic acid significantly reduced risk of secondary haemorrhage (RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.50), but not primary haemorrhage (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 38.23) after knife and laser cone biopsy, compared with placebo. There was also a statistically significant reduction in postoperative blood loss compared with placebo (MD = ‐55.60, 95% CI ‐94.91 to ‐16.29).
