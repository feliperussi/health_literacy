Background
In pregnancies complicated by diabetes the major concerns during the third trimester are fetal distress and the potential for birth trauma associated with fetal macrosomia. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effect of a policy of elective delivery, as compared to expectant management, in term diabetic pregnant women, on maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (24 July 2004). We updated this search on 24 July 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section. 
Selection criteria
All available randomized controlled trials of elective delivery, either by induction of labour or by elective caesarean section, compared to expectant management in diabetic pregnant women at term. 
Data collection and analysis
The reports of the only available trial were analysed independently by the three co‐reviewers to retrieve data on maternal and perinatal outcomes. Results are expressed as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
The participants in the one trial included in this review were 200 insulin‐requiring diabetic women. Most had gestational diabetes, except 13 women with type 2 pre‐existing diabetes (class B). The trial compared a policy of active induction of labour at 38 completed weeks of pregnancy, to expectant management until 42 weeks. The risk of caesarean section was not statistically different between groups (relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 ‐ 1.26). The risk of macrosomia was reduced in the active induction group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 ‐ 0.98) and three cases of mild shoulder dystocia were reported in the expectant management group. No other perinatal morbidity was reported.
