Combined data from four trials (225 participants) suggested probiotics may reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations during a four to 12 month time‐frame, mean difference (MD) ‐0.32 episodes per participant (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.68 to 0.03; P = 0.07) (low‐certainty evidence); however, the 95% CI includes the possibility of both an increased and a reduced number of exacerbations. Additionally, two trials (127 participants) found no evidence of an effect on the duration of antibiotic therapy during the same time period. Combined data from four trials (177 participants) demonstrated probiotics may reduce faecal calprotectin, MD ‐47.4 µg/g (95% CI ‐93.28 to ‐1.54; P = 0.04) (low‐certainty evidence), but the results for other biomarkers mainly did not show any difference between probiotics and placebo. Two trials (91 participants) found no evidence of effect on height, weight or body mass index (low‐certainty evidence). Combined data from five trials (284 participants) suggested there was no difference in lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) % predicted) during a three‐ to 12‐month time frame, MD 1.36% (95% CI ‐1.20 to 3.91; P = 0.30) (low‐certainty evidence). Combined data from two trials (115 participants) suggested there was no difference in hospitalisation rates during a three‐ to 12‐month time frame, MD ‐0.44 admissions per participant (95% CI ‐1.41 to 0.54; P = 0.38) (low‐certainty evidence). One trial (37 participants) reported health‐related quality of life and while the parent report favoured probiotics, SMD 0.87 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.55) the child self‐report did not identify any effect, SMD 0.59 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.26) (low‐certainty evidence). There were limited results for gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal microbial profile which were not analysable.
