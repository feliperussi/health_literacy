Six controlled before‐after studies compared the home‐like model and the traditional environment (75,074 participants), but one controlled before‐after study included 74,449 of the participants (estimated on weighting). It is uncertain whether home‐like models improve health‐related quality of life, behaviour, mood and depression, function or serious adverse effects compared to traditional designs because the certainty of the evidence is very low. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded from low‐certainty to very low‐certainty for all outcomes due to very serious concerns due to risk of bias, and also serious concerns due to imprecision for outcomes with more than 400 participants. One controlled before‐after study examined the effect of home‐like models on quality of life. The author stated "No statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups." Three studies reported on global behaviour (N = 257). One study found little or no difference in global behaviour change at six months using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory where lower scores indicate fewer behavioural symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.13 to 0.04, n = 164)), and two additional studies (N = 93) examined global behaviour, but these were unsuitable for determining a summary effect estimate. Two controlled before‐after studies examined the effect of home‐like models of care compared to traditional design on depression. After 18 months, one study (n = 242) reported an increase in the rate of depressive symptoms (rate ratio 1.15 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.29)), but the effect of home‐like models of care on the probability of no depressive symptoms was uncertain (odds ratio 0.36 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.07)). One study (n = 164) reported little or no difference in depressive symptoms at six months using the Revised Memory and Behaviour Problems Checklist where lower scores indicate fewer depressive symptoms (MD 0.01 (95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.14)). Four controlled before‐after studies examined function. One study (n = 242) reported little or no difference in function over 18 months using the Activities of Daily Living long‐form scale where lower scores indicate better function (MD ‐0.09 (95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.28)), and one study (n = 164) reported better function scores at six months using the Interview for the Deterioration of Daily Living activities in Dementia where lower scores indicate better function (MD ‐4.37 (95% CI ‐7.06 to ‐1.69)). Two additional studies measured function but could not be included in the quantitative analysis. One study examined serious adverse effects (physical restraints), and reported a slight reduction in the important outcome of physical restraint use in a home‐like model of care compared to a traditional design (MD between the home‐like model of care and traditional design ‐0.3% (95% CI ‐0.5% to ‐0.1%), estimate weighted n = 74,449 participants at enrolment).
