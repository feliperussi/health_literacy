Background
Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) increases protein synthesis, therefore it is used in burns with a total body surface area (TBSA) greater than 40%, where there is frequently an increase in protein breakdown and a decrease in protein synthesis. This change in protein metabolism correlates with poor wound healing of the burn and donor sites. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of rhGH on the healing rate of burn wounds and donor sites in people with burns. 
Search methods
For this first update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 04 September 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 8); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to September Week 4 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations September 8, 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 35); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 8 September 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rhGH with any comparator intervention, e.g. oxandrolone or placebo, in adults or children with burns. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were the healing of the burn wound and donor sites and the occurrence of wound infections. The secondary outcomes were mortality rate, length of hospital stay, scar assessment, and adverse events: hyperglycaemia and septicaemia. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs (701 people). Six of the RCTs included only children aged 1 to 18 years and seven involved only adults (from 18 to 65 years of age). The mean TBSA of the included participants was greater than 49%. Twelve studies compared rhGH with placebo and one study compared rhGH with oxandrolone. Two trials found that compared with placebo, burn wounds in adults treated with rhGH healed more quickly (by 9.07 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.39 to 13.76, I² = 0%). The donor site healing time was significantly shorter in rhGH‐treated adults compared with placebo‐treated participants (by 3.15 days; 95% CI 1.54 to 4.75, I² = 0%). Two studies in children with the outcome of donor site healing time could be pooled and the donor site healing time was shorter in the rhGH‐treated children (by 1.70 days; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.53, I² = 0%). No studies reporting the outcome of wound infection were found. The incidence of hyperglycaemia was higher in adults during rhGH treatment compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.43; 95% CI 1.54 to 3.85), but not in children. Pooling the studies of adults and children yielded a significantly higher incidence of hyperglycaemia in the rhGH‐treated participants (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.68 to 4.16).
