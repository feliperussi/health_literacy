Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS 
Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for progressive MS 
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in primary progressive MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL. 
Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS  
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in relapsing MS at 12 months' follow‐up. Rituximab may decrease recurrence of relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.  
Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer.
