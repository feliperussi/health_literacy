Background
Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as urgency with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Pharmacotherapy with anticholinergic drugs is often the first line medical therapy, either alone or as an adjunct to various non‐pharmacological therapies after conservative options such as reducing intake of caffeine drinks have been tried. Non‐pharmacologic therapies consist of bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, behavioural modification, electrical stimulation and surgical interventions. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of anticholinergic drugs with various non‐pharmacologic therapies for non‐neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 4 September 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE, and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised, controlled trials of treatment with anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder syndrome or urgency urinary incontinence in adults in which at least one management arm involved a non‐drug therapy. Trials amongst patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors evaluated the trials for appropriateness for inclusion and risk of bias. Two authors were involved in the data extraction. Data extraction was based on predetermined criteria. Data analysis was based on standard statistical approaches used in Cochrane reviews. 
Main results
Twenty three trials were included with a total of 3685 participants, one was a cross‐over trial and the other 22 were parallel group trials. The duration of follow up varied from two to 52 weeks. The trials were generally small and of poor methodological quality.
