After one year of follow‐up, 24% of participants randomised to endovascular treatment and 32% of participants randomised to the surgical treatment group had poor functional outcome. The risk ratio (RR) of poor outcome (death or dependency) for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.87; 4 trials, 2429 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), and the absolute risk reduction was 7% (95% CI 4% to 11%). In the worst‐case scenario analysis for poor outcome, the RR for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 0.80 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91), and the absolute risk reduction was 6% (95% CI 2% to 10%). The RR of death at 12 months was 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.02; 4 trials, 2429 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). In a subgroup analysis of participants with an anterior circulation aneurysm, the RR of poor outcome was 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.90; 2 trials, 2157 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), and the absolute risk decrease was 7% (95% CI 3% to 10%). In subgroup analysis of those with a posterior circulation aneurysm, the RR was 0.41 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.92; 2 trials, 69 participants, low‐quality evidence), and the absolute decrease in risk was 27% (95% CI 6% to 48%). At five years, 28% of participants randomised to endovascular treatment and 32% of participants randomised to surgical treatment had poor functional outcome. The RR of poor outcome for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.01, 1 trial, 1724 participants, low‐quality evidence). At 10 years, 35% participants allocated to endovascular and 43% participants allocated to surgical treatment had poor functional outcome. At 10 years RR of poor outcome for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 0.81 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.92; 1 trial, 1316 participants, low‐quality evidence). The RR of delayed cerebral ischaemia at two to three months for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; 4 trials, 2450 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The RR of rebleeding for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 1.83 (95% CI 1.04 to 3.23; 4 trials, 2458 participants, high‐quality evidence) at one year, and 2.69 (95% CI 1.50 to 4.81; 1 trial, 1323 participants, low‐quality evidence) at 10 years. The RR of complications from intervention for endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping was 1.05 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.53; 2 trials, 129 participants, low‐quality evidence).
