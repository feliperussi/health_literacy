Background
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an important therapy for patients with end‐stage kidney disease and is used in more than 200,000 such patients globally. However, its value is often limited by the development of infections such as peritonitis and exit‐site and tunnel infections. Multiple strategies have been developed to reduce the risk of peritonitis including antibiotics, topical disinfectants to the exit site and antifungal agents. However, the effectiveness of these strategies has been variable and are based on a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The optimal preventive strategies to reduce the occurrence of peritonitis remain unclear. 
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of antimicrobial strategies used to prevent peritonitis in PD patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 4 October 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
RCTs or quasi‐RCTs in patients receiving chronic PD, which evaluated any antimicrobial agents used systemically or locally to prevent peritonitis or exit‐site/tunnel infection were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
