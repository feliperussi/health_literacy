Background
Asthma is a common long‐term respiratory disease affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide. Approximately half of people with asthma have an important allergic component to their disease, which may provide an opportunity for targeted treatment. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) aims to reduce asthma symptoms by delivering increasing doses of an allergen (e.g. house dust mite, pollen extract) under the tongue to induce immune tolerance. Fifty‐two studies were identified and synthesised in the original Cochrane Review in 2015, but questions remained about the safety and efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy for people with asthma. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy compared with placebo or standard care for adults and children with asthma. 
Search methods
The original searches for trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles found trials up to 25 March 2015. The most recent search for trials for the current update was conducted on 29 October 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel randomised controlled trials, irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated sublingual immunotherapy versus placebo or as an add‐on to standard asthma management. We included both adults and children with asthma of any severity and with any allergen‐sensitisation pattern. We included studies that recruited participants with asthma, rhinitis, or both, providing at least 80% of trial participants had a diagnosis of asthma. We selected outcomes to reflect recommended outcomes for asthma clinical trials and those most important to people with asthma. Primary outcomes were asthma exacerbations requiring a visit to the emergency department (ED) or admission to hospital, validated measures of quality of life, and all‐cause serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes were asthma symptom scores, exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, response to provocation tests, and dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data, and assessed risk of bias, all of which were cross‐checked for accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. 
We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random‐effects models. We considered the strength of evidence for all primary and secondary outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixty‐six studies met the inclusion criteria for this update, including 52 studies from the original review. Most studies were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, varied in duration from one day to three years, and recruited participants with mild or intermittent asthma, often with comorbid allergic rhinitis. Twenty‐three studies recruited adults and teenagers; 31 recruited only children; three recruited both; and nine did not specify.
