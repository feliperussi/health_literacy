The updated search identified one published study that was previously ongoing. A total of 9 studies evaluating 3973 infants were included in this review. Mortality during hospital stay in infants with clinically suspected infection was not significantly different after IVIG treatment (9 studies (n = 2527); typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; typical RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐ 0.04 to 0.02; I2 = 23% for RR and 29% for RD). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different in infants with suspected infection after IVIG treatment (1 study (n = 1985); RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.03). Mortality during hospital stay was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with proven infection at trial entry (1 trial (n = 1446); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21; RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.03). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with proven infection at trial entry (1 trial (n = 1393); RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.06). Mortality during hospital stay in infants with clinically suspected or proven infection at trial entry was not significantly different after IVIG treatment (1 study (n = 3493); RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; RD 0.00, 95% CI ‐ 0.02 to 0.03). Death or major disability at 2 years corrected age was not significantly different after IVIG treatment in infants with suspected or proven infection at trial entry (1 study (n = 3493); RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; RD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.03). Length of hospital stay was not reduced for infants with suspected or proven infection at trial entry (1 study (n = 3493); mean difference (MD) 0.00 days, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.61). No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after administration of IgM‐enriched IVIG for suspected infection at trial entry was reported in 4 studies (n = 266) (typical RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.20; RD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.02; I2 = 17% for RR and 53% for RD).
