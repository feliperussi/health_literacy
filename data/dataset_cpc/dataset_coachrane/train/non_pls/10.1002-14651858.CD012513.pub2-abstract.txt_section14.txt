Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with improved overall survival (risk ratio (RR mortality), 0.23 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 4.55, P = 0.34, one RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care at 24 months. There was no evidence that such interventions were associated with improvements in cancer‐specific survival or cardiovascular event frequency as no cancer‐related deaths, myocardial infarctions or strokes were reported in the included studies. None of the included RCTs reported data for the outcome of recurrence‐free survival. Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with significant weight loss at either six months (mean difference (MD) ‐1.88 kg, 95% CI ‐5.98 to 2.21 kg, P = 0.37, three RCTs, 131 participants, I2= 0%; low‐certainty evidenc e)or 12 months (MD ‐8.98 kg, 95% CI ‐19.88 to 1.92 kg, P = 0.11, two RCTs, 91 participants, I2= 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) when compared with usual care. Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with increased quality of life, when measured using either the SF‐12 Physical Health questionnaire or FACT‐G at six months (FACT‐G MD 2.51, 95% CI ‐5.61 to 10.64, P = 0.54, two RCTs, 95 participants, I2= 83%; very low‐certainty evidence), or by FACT‐G alone at 12 months (MD 2.77, 95% CI ‐0.65 to 6.20, P = 0.11, two RCTs, 89 participants, I2= 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) when compared with usual care. No serious adverse events, for example hospitalisation or deaths, were reported in included trials. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions were associated with a higher risk of musculoskeletal symptoms (RR 19.03, 95% CI 1.17, 310.52, P = 0.04, two RCTs, 91 participants; low‐certainty evidence).
