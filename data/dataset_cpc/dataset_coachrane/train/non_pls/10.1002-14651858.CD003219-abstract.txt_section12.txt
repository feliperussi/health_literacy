Twenty‐one trials involving 884 people were included. A hand brace significantly improved symptoms after four weeks (weighted mean difference (WMD) ‐1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.29 to ‐0.85) and function (WMD ‐0.55; 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.28). In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial. However one trial showed significant symptom improvement after seven weeks of ultrasound (WMD ‐0.99; 95% CI ‐1.77 to ‐ 0.21) which was maintained at six months (WMD ‐1.86; 95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐1.05). Four trials involving 193 people examined various oral medications (steroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs) versus placebo. Compared to placebo, pooled data for two‐week oral steroid treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms (WMD ‐7.23; 95% CI ‐10.31 to ‐4.14). One trial also showed improvement after four weeks (WMD ‐10.8; 95% CI ‐15.26 to ‐6.34). Compared to placebo, diuretics or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs did not demonstrate significant benefit. In two trials involving 50 people, vitamin B6 did not significantly improve overall symptoms. In one trial involving 51 people yoga significantly reduced pain after eight weeks (WMD ‐1.40; 95% CI ‐2.73 to ‐0.07) compared with wrist splinting. In one trial involving 21 people carpal bone mobilisation significantly improved symptoms after three weeks (WMD ‐1.43; 95% CI ‐2.19 to ‐0.67) compared to no treatment. In one trial involving 50 people with diabetes, steroid and insulin injections significantly improved symptoms over eight weeks compared with steroid and placebo injections. Two trials involving 105 people compared ergonomic keyboards versus control and demonstrated equivocal results for pain and function. Trials of magnet therapy, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic care did not demonstrate symptom benefit when compared to placebo or control.
