We included eight trials, involving 952 participants, of which 64% were women. Included trials were generally of adequate quality, with six trials at low risk of bias, and two trials at high risk of bias. Three trials with 518 participants compared five different drugs with placebo; all reported the primary outcome as mean change in visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 100) for nausea severity from baseline to 30 minutes. Trials did not routinely report other primary outcomes of the change in nausea VAS at 60 minutes or number of vomiting episodes. Differences in mean VAS change from baseline to 30 minutes between placebo and the drugs evaluated were: metoclopramide (three trials, 301 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐11.33 to 0.80), ondansetron (two trials, 250 participants; MD ‐4.32, 95% CI ‐11.20 to 2.56), prochlorperazine (one trial, 50 participants; MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐14.40 to 10.80), promethazine (one trial, 82 participants; MD ‐8.47, 95% CI ‐19.79 to 2.85) and droperidol (one trial, 48 participants; MD ‐15.8, 95% CI ‐26.98 to ‐4.62). The only statistically significant change in baseline VAS to 30 minutes was for droperidol, in a single trial of 48 participants. No other drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo. Other included trials evaluated a drug compared to "active controls" (alternative antiemetic). There was no convincing evidence of superiority of any particular drug compared to active control. All trials included in this review reported adverse events, but they were variably reported precluding meaningful pooling of results. Adverse events were generally mild, there were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were not enough data.
