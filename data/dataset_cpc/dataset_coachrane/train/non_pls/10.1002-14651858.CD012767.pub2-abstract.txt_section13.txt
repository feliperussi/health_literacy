RFT may have no effect on the rate of major complications compared to GDFT, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.34; 484 participants; 5 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). RFT may increase the risk of all‐cause mortality compared to GDFT, but the evidence on this is also very uncertain (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 544 participants; 6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). In a post‐hoc analysis using a Peto odds ratio (OR) or a Poisson regression model, the odds of all‐cause mortality were 4.81 times greater with the use of RFT compared to GDFT, but the evidence again is very uncertain (Peto OR 4.81, 95% CI 1.38 to 16.84; 544 participants; 6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis shows that exclusion of a study in which the final volume of fluid received intraoperatively was higher in the RFT group than in the GDFT group revealed no differences in mortality. Based on analysis of secondary outcomes, such as length of hospital stay (464 participants; 5 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), surgery‐related complications (364 participants; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), non‐surgery‐related complications (74 participants; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence), renal failure (410 participants; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), and quality of surgical recovery (74 participants; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence), GDFT may have no effect on the risk of these outcomes compared to RFT, but the evidence is very uncertain. Included studies provided no data on administration of vasopressors or inotropes to correct haemodynamic instability nor on cost of treatment.
