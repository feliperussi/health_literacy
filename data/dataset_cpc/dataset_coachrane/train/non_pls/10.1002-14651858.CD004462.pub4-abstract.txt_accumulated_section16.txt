Background
Urinary incontinence can affect 40% to 60% of people admitted to hospital after a stroke, with 25% still having problems when discharged from hospital and 15% remaining incontinent after one year. 
This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2008.
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for treating urinary incontinence after stroke in adults at least one‐month post‐stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence and Cochrane Stroke Specialised Registers (searched 30 October 2017 and 1 November 2017 respectively), which contain trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently undertook data extraction, risk of bias assessment and implemented GRADE. 
Main results
We included 20 trials (reporting 21 comparisons) with 1338 participants. Data for prespecified outcomes were not available except where reported below. 
Intervention versus no intervention/usual care 
Behavioural interventions: Low‐quality evidence suggests behavioural interventions may reduce the mean number of incontinent episodes in 24 hours (mean difference (MD) –1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) –2.74 to 0.74; 1 trial; 18 participants; P = 0.26). Further, low‐quality evidence from two trials suggests that behavioural interventions may make little or no difference to quality of life (SMD ‐0.99, 95% CI ‐2.83 to 0.86; 55 participants). 
Specialised professional input interventions: One trial of moderate‐quality suggested structured assessment and management by continence nurse practitioners probably made little or no difference to the number of people continent three months after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.02; 121 participants; equivalent to an increase from 354 to 453 per 1000, 95% CI 287 to 715).
