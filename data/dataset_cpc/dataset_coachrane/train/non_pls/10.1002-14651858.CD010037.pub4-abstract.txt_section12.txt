The 2020 updated search identified four new trials. We included a total of 20 trials with 3512 participants, however we only included 18 for the meta‐analysis with 3140 participants. None of the studies reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was: mean difference (MD) ‐1.37 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.08, ‐0.66; 3140 participants; 18 studies; I2 = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; and MD ‐1.45, 95% CI ‐2.23, ‐0.67; 3039 participants; 17 studies; I2 = 45%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35 years was: MD ‐1.86, 95% CI ‐3.45, ‐0.27; 452 participants; eight studies; I2 = 19%, moderate‐certainty evidence; MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.22, ‐0.79; 351 participants; seven studies ; I2 = 54%, moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those 35 years or older was: MD ‐0.97, 95% CI ‐1.83, ‐0.10; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; MD ‐0.59, 95% CI ‐1.13, ‐0.06; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women was: MD ‐1.25, 95% CI ‐2.53, 0.03; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 0%, high‐certainty evidence; MD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.86, ‐0.22; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 4%, high‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men was MD ‐2.14, 95% CI ‐3.71, ‐0.59; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 8%, moderate‐certainty evidence; MD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25, ‐0.74; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 41%, moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively. The effect was consistent in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake.
