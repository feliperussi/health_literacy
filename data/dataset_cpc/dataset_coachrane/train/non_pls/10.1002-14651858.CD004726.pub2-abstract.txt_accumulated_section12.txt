Background
Dog bites can have dramatic consequences for children and adolescents. Educating young people on how to interact with dogs could contribute to reducing dog bite injuries. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions that target children and adolescents in reducing dog bite injuries and their consequences. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Injuries Group’s Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), CAB Abstracts, Zetoc, SIGLE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycInfo, SPECTR, CINAHL, National Research Register, LILACs, African Healthline, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, CurrentClinicalTrials.Gov, Centrewatch, Controlledtrials.com, Vetgate and the WHO database. We checked the bibliographies of relevant reviews and trials and also contacted experts in the field. The searches were carried out to 18 July 2008. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and controlled before‐after studies that evaluated the effectiveness of educational interventions, in populations under 20 years old, for preventing dog bites. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected eligible studies based on information from the title and abstract. Two review authors decided on the inclusion of eligible trials and extracted data from the trial reports. We contacted authors of eligible studies to obtain more information. 
Main results
Two studies met the inclusion criteria. No study looked at our main outcome: dog bite rates. The included studies were randomised controlled trials conducted in kindergarten and primary schools. Their methodology was of moderate quality. One study showed that the intervention group showed less 'inappropriate behaviour' when observed in the presence of a dog after a 30‐minute educational intervention. Another study showed an increase in knowledge and in caution after an information programme.
