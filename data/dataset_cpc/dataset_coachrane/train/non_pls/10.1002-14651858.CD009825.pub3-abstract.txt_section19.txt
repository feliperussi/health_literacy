The included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non‐fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re‐analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low‐quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra‐virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low‐fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate‐quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low‐quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (‐0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.00) and moderate‐quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (‐2.99 mmHg (95% CI ‐3.45 to ‐2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (‐2.0 mmHg, 95% CI ‐2.29 to ‐1.71), with low or very low‐quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate‐quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (‐0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.27 to ‐0.02) and triglycerides (‐0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.16 to ‐0.01) with moderate or low‐quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure.
