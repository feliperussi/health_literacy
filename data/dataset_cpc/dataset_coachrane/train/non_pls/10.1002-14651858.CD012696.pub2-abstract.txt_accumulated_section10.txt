Background
Pregnancies with pre‐existing diabetes are high risk, with increased risk of poorer fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. Identifying interventions to improving health outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants is a priority, as rates of diabetes continue to increase. 
Exercise has been shown to have benefits for non‐pregnant individuals with pre‐existing type 2 diabetes, such as improving glycaemic control, and reducing visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides. For pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes, the effects of exercise interventions on the mother and her baby are unknown. 
An earlier Cochrane review on 'Exercise for pregnant women with diabetes' considered both pre‐existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. That Cochrane review has now been split into two new reviews (following new protocols) ‐ one on gestational diabetes and one on pre‐existing diabetes (this review). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of exercise interventions for improving maternal and fetal outcomes in women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 27 June 2017, and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We had planned to include published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cluster‐randomised trials, in full text or abstract format that compared any type of exercise programme, added to standard care, targeted at women with known pre‐gestational diabetes (type 1 or type 2 diabetes), at any stage of pregnancy, compared with 1) standard care alone or 2) standard care plus another exercise intervention. Quasi‐randomised and cross‐over trials were excluded. Conference abstracts were handled in the same way as full‐text publications.
