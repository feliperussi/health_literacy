Background
In the absence of treatment, endometrial hyperplasia (EH) can progress to endometrial cancer, particularly in the presence of histologic nuclear atypia. The development of EH results from exposure of the endometrium to oestrogen unopposed by progesterone. Oral progestogens have been used as treatment for EH without atypia, and in some cases of EH with atypia in women who wish to preserve fertility or who cannot tolerate surgery. EH without atypia is associated with a low risk of progression to atypia and cancer; EH with atypia is where the cells are structurally abnormal, and has a higher risk of developing cancer. Oral progestogen is not always effective at reversing the hyperplasia, can be associated with side effects, and depends on patient adherence. The levonorgestrel‐intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is an alternative method of administration of progestogen and may have some advantages over non‐intrauterine progestogens. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) in women with endometrial hyperplasia (EH) with or without atypia compared to medical treatment with non‐intrauterine progestogens, placebo, surgery or no treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and conference proceedings of 10 relevant organisations. We handsearched references in relevant published studies. We also searched ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, and other trial registries. We performed the final search in May 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials of women with a histological diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia with or without atypia comparing LNG‐IUS with non‐intrauterine progestogens, placebo, surgery or no treatment.
