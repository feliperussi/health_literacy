Background
The established mental health care system does not have the resources to meet the extensive need for care of those with anxiety and depressive disorders. Paraprofessionals partially replacing professionals may be cost‐effective. 
Objectives
To investigate the effectiveness of any kind of psychological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders performed by paraprofessionals. To examine whether the results apply to clinically significant disorders. 
Search methods
CCDANCTR‐Studies, EMBASE (ExerptaMedica), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, all years published using the key words: para‐/paraprofessional, non‐/nonprofessional, rand*, psy*; peer; volunt*; citation lists of articles reviewing the subject and included studies; correspondence with authors of controlled studies, and review reports on the subject. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that used symptom measures, and compared the effects of treatments given by paraprofessionals (paid or voluntary, unqualified with respect to the psychological treatment) with treatments given by professionals, and with waiting list or placebo condition. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard mean difference was used to pool continuous data, and odds ratios were used to pool dichotomous data, using a random effects model. The generic inverse variance method was used for combining continuous and dichotomous data. The effect of low quality studies and the use of self‐rated versus observer‐rated measures were tested. Subgroup analyses were performed for differences between depression and anxiety diagnosis, paraprofessionals with/without professional background, group/individual intervention, length of follow‐up and gender (post‐hoc subgroup analysis). 
Main results
Five studies reported five comparisons of paraprofessionals versus professionals (n=106) and five comparisons of paraprofessionals versus control condition (n=220). No differences were found between paraprofessionals and professionals (SMD=0.09, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.40, p=0.58), and no significant heterogeneity. Studies comparing paraprofessionals versus control (mixed continuous and dichotomous data) showed a significant effect in favour of paraprofessionals (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88, p=0.03), but heterogeneity was indicated (I²=60.9%, Chi²= 10.24, df=4, p=0.04). After correction for heterogeneity and removing one study of low quality, the pooling of data from three studies (n=128; mixed gender; women) indicated no significant difference in effect between paraprofessionals and professionals (SMD=0.13, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.64; p=0.63) and a strongly significant pooled effect for three studies (n=188; women) favouring paraprofessionals over the control condition (OR=0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.48, p<0.00001), and homogeneity indicated between studies (I²=0%, Chi²=0.47, df=2, p=0.79).
