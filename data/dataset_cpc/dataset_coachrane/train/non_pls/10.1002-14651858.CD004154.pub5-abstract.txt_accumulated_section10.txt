Background
Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of the population, with up to 30% of patients continuing to have seizures, despite antiepileptic drug treatment. Clobazam is a 1,5‐benzodiazepine and is commonly used as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant epilepsy. This review is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review, first published in 2008, and examines the most current literature regarding clobazam as an add‐on for drug‐resistant epilepsy. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, effectiveness and tolerability of clobazam as an add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant generalised‐onset and focal‐onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults and children. 
Search methods
For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 9 October 2018: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline (Ovid) 1946 to 8 October, 2018, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). For some previous updates we also searched SCOPUS, DARE, and BIOSIS Previews, but these are no longer needed. (SCOPUS was searched as a substitute for EMBASE, but randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in EMBASE are now included in CENTRAL; DARE ceased operation at the end of March 2015; BIOSIS Previews yielded no relevant items that were not found in the other databases). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of add‐on clobazam, with adequate methods of allocation concealment, recruiting patients with drug‐resistant focal or generalised‐onset seizures, with a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed: 50% or greater reduction in seizures, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal and adverse events.
