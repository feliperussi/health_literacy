Background
Cognitive impairments, particularly memory problems, are a defining feature of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are specific interventional approaches designed to address difficulties with memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning. The present review is an update of previous versions of this review. 
Objectives
The main aim of the current review was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in relation to important cognitive and non‐cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver in the short, medium and long term. 
Search methods
The CDCIG Specialized Register, ALOIS, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS and many other clinical trial databases and grey literature sources, was most recently searched on 2 November 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions, and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the family caregiver, were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta‐analysis could be conducted for 11 of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta‐analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed‐effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi2 statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta‐analysis could be conducted.
