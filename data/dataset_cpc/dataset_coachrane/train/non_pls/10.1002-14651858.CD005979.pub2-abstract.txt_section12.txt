We included 18 studies (seven identified in the update): 17 of reference pricing, one of which also assessed maximum prices, and one of index pricing. None of the studies were trials. All included studies used ITS or RM analyses. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. Three reference pricing studies reported cumulative drug expenditures at one year after the transition period. Two studies reported the median relative insurer's cumulative expenditures, on both reference drugs and cost share drugs, of ‐18%, ranging from ‐36% to 3%. The third study reported relative insurer's cumulative expenditures on total market of ‐1.5%. Four reference pricing studies reported median relative insurer's expenditures on both reference drugs and cost share drugs of ‐10%, ranging from ‐53% to 4% at one year after the transition period. Four reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of 15% in reference drugs prescriptions at one year (range ‐14% to 166%). Three reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of ‐39% in cost share drugs prescriptions at one year (range ‐87% to ‐17%). One study of index pricing reported a relative change of 55% (95% CI 11% to 98%) in the use of generic drugs and ‐43% relative change (95% CI ‐67% to ‐18%) in brand drugs at six months after the transition period. The same study reported a price change of ‐5.3% and ‐1.1% for generic and brand drugs respectively six months after the start of the policy. One study of maximum prices reported a relative change in monthly sales volume of all statins of 21% (95% CI 19% to 24%) after one year of the introduction of this policy. Four studies reported effects on mortality and healthcare utilisation, however they were excluded because of study design limitations.
