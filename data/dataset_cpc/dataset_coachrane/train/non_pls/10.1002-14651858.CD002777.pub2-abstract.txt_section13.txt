As compared to low MCT formula, preterm infants fed high MCT formula showed little to no difference in weight gain velocity (g/kg/d) during the intervention, with a typical mean difference (MD) of ‐0.21 g/kg/d (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.24 to 0.83; 6 studies, 118 infants; low‐certainty evidence). The analysis for weight gain (g/d) did not show evidence of differences, with an MD of 0.00 g/d (95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.93; 1 study, 18 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), finding an average weight gain of 20 ± 5.9 versus 20 ± 6.9 g/d for high and low MCT groups, respectively. We found that length gain showed no difference between low and high MCT formulas, with a typical MD of 0.10 cm/week (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.29; 3 studies, 61 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). Head circumference gain also showed little to no difference during the intervention period, with an MD of ‐0.04 cm/week (95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.09; 3 studies, 61 infants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported skinfold thickness with different measurement definitions, and evidence was insufficient to determine if there was a difference (2 studies, 32 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). There are conflicting data (5 studies) as to formula tolerance, with 4 studies reporting narrative results of no observed clinical difference and 1 study reporting higher incidence of signs of gastrointestinal intolerance in high MCT formula groups. There is no evidence of effect on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), based on small numbers in two trials. Review authors found no studies addressing long‐term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes.
