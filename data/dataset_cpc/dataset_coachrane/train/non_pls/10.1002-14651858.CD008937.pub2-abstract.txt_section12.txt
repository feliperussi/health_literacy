Fourteen studies (n = 1245) met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies compared CBT with control and comparisons at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment showed beneficial effects of therapy that ranged from medium (when defined by financial loss from gambling: SMD ‐0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.71 to ‐0.33, n = 505) to very large (for gambling symptom severity: SMD ‐1.82; 95% CI ‐2.61 to ‐1.02, n = 402). Only one study (n = 147) compared groups at 9 to 12 months follow‐up and produced smaller effects that were not significant. Four studies of motivational interviewing therapy were identified and mainly considered samples demonstrating less severe gambling (relative to studies of pathological gamblers). Data suggested reduced financial loss from gambling following motivational interviewing therapy at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.41; 95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.07, n = 244), although comparisons on other outcomes were not significant. The effect approached zero when defined by gambling symptom severity (SMD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.50, n = 163). Studies compared groups at 9 to 12 months follow‐up and found a significant effect of motivational interviewing therapy in terms of frequency of gambling (SMD ‐0.53; 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.02, n = 62), with comparisons on other outcomes that were not significant. Two studies of integrative therapies also considered samples demonstrating overall low gambling severity, and found no significant effects of therapy at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment. Comparisons at 9 to 12 months follow‐up suggested a medium effect from therapy in terms of gambling symptom severity, with no significant differences for other outcomes. One study (n = 18) considered another psychological therapy (i.e.Twelve‐Step Facilitated Group Therapy) and suggested beneficial effects in terms of most outcomes at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment. The evidence supporting these various classes of therapy ranged from very low to low quality.
