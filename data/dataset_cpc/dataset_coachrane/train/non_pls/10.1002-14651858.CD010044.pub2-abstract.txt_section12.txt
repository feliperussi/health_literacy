Five studies with a total of 105 participants were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review. All included trials were short‐term studies (two days or less), measuring immediate effects of the interventions. There was insufficient detail in the reports to assess methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. All five studies were at a high risk of bias from lack of blinding. The studies did not report on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, serious adverse events or any of the other prespecified outcomes. One study was a randomised cross‐over trial conducted over two days, in which investigators applied two interventions twice daily in randomly assigned order, with a reverse cross‐over the following day. Four studies applied multiple interventions for cough augmentation to each participant, in random order. One study reported fatigue as an adverse effect of MI‐E, using a visual analogue scale. Peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF) was the most common outcome measure and was reported in four studies. Based on three studies, MI‐E may improve PCEF compared to an unassisted cough. All interventions increased PCEF to the critical level necessary for mucus clearance. The included studies did not clearly show that MI‐E improves cough expiratory flow more than other cough augmentation techniques. Based on one study, which was at risk of assessor bias, the addition of MI‐E may reduce treatment time when added to a standard airway clearance regimen with manually assisted cough. MI‐E appeared to be as well tolerated as other cough augmentation techniques, based on three studies which reported comfort visual analogue scores.
