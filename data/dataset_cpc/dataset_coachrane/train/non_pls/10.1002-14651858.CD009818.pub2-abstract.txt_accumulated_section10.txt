Background
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub‐Saharan Africa. Although antiretroviral drugs have helped to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of HIV‐positive individuals, there is still a need to explore other interventions that will help to further reduce the disease burden. One potential strategy is the use of interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART). IL‐2 is a cytokine that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes and may help to boost the immune system. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for HIV‐positive adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources up to 26 May 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Web of Science; LILACS; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also checked conference abstracts, contacted experts and relevant organizations in the field, and checked the reference list of all studies identified by the above methods for any other potentially eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of IL‐2 as an adjunct to ART in reducing the morbidity and mortality in HIV‐positive adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and selected trials that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. Where possible, we compared the effects of interventions using risk ratios (RR), and presented them with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
