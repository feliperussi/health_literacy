Background
The impact of workplace interventions on the outcome of occupational asthma is not well understood. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions on occupational asthma.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); EMBASE(Ovid); NIOSHTIC‐2; and CISILO (CCOHS) up to July 31, 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included all eligible randomized controlled trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time‐series of workplace interventions for occupational asthma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. 
Main results
We included 26 non‐randomized controlled before and after studies with 1,695 participants that reported on three comparisons: complete removal from exposure and reduced exposure compared to continued exposure, and complete removal from exposure compared to reduced exposure. Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. For continued exposure, 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow‐up, the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 %) was 5.4% during follow‐up, and the standardized change in non‐specific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH) was ‐0.18. 
In 18 studies, authors compared removal from exposure to continued exposure. Removal may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of asthma symptoms, with risk ratio (RR) 4.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 13.86), and it may improve asthma symptoms, with RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.84), compared to continued exposure. Change in FEV1 % may be better with removal from exposure, with a mean difference (MD) of 4.23 % (95% CI 1.14 to 7.31) compared to continued exposure. NSBH may improve with removal from exposure, with standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.43 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.82).
