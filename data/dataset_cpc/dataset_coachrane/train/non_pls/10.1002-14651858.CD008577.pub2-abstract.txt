Background
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterised by systemic intravascular activation of coagulation. There are several obstetric causes of DIC during pregnancy and postpartum. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of haematological interventions such as heparins (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH), danaparoid sodium, synthetic protease inhibitor, antithrombin, human recombinant activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor, recombinant activated factor VIIa and any other types of haematological interventions (except transfusions) for treating DIC during pregnancy and postpartum. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 July 2010), LILACS (1982 to 22 July 2010), ongoing trials registries via the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal (22 July 2010), and other relevant websites (22 July 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on any haematological interventions for treating DIC during pregnancy and postpartum. 
Data collection and analysis
There were no included studies.
Main results
We could not find any RCTs on haematological interventions (heparins (LMWH and UFH), danaparoid sodium, synthetic protease inhibitor, antithrombin, human recombinant activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor, recombinant activated factor VIIa and any other types of haematological interventions) for treating DIC during pregnancy and postpartum. 
Authors' conclusions
This review found no RCTs on the safety and efficacy of haematological interventions for treating DIC during pregnancy and postpartum. Such interventions need to be tested in RCTs assessing outcomes such as maternal death, perinatal death and safety.
