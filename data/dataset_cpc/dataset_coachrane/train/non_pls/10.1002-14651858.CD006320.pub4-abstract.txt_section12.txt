Six studies with a total of 1039 patients were eligible for inclusion. The two largest studies were rated as low risk of bias for all assessed items. Four studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment. Two studies were rated as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. There was a marginal significant benefit of n‐3 therapy for maintenance of remission. Thirty‐nine per cent of patients in the n‐3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039 patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to unexplained heterogeneity (I2 = 58%), publication bias, and a high or unknown risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis. When two large studies at low risk of bias were considered the benefit was no longer statistically significant. Thirty‐seven per cent of patients in the n‐3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). No significant heterogeneity was identified for this pooled analysis ( I2 = 0%). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events). No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (4 studies, 862 patients; RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (5 studies, 999 patients; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.18) in the n‐3 treatment group.
