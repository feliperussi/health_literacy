Background
Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. 
Main results
Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross‐over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight‐reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. 
Seven trials tested anti‐diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc‐aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified.
