Background
Pre‐eclampsia is a relatively common complication of pregnancy. HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a severe manifestation of pre‐eclampsia with significant morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their children. Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of HELLP syndrome in the belief that they improve outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of corticosteroids on women with HELLP syndrome and their children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing any corticosteroid with placebo, no treatment, or other drug; or comparing one corticosteroid with another corticosteroid or dosage in women with HELLP syndrome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.
Main results
Eleven trials (550 women) compared corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment. There was no difference in the risk of maternal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 3.21), maternal death or severe maternal morbidity (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.12), or perinatal/infant death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.97). The only clear effect of treatment on individual outcomes was improved platelet count (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.10). The effect on platelet count was strongest for women who commenced treatment antenatally (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.35). 
Two trials (76 women) compared dexamethasone with betamethasone. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups in respect to perinatal/infant death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.17) or severe perinatal/infant morbidity or death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48). Maternal death and severe maternal morbidity were not reported. In respect to platelet count, dexamethasone was superior to betamethasone (MD 6.02, 95% CI 1.71 to 10.33), both when treatment was commenced antenatally (MD 8.10, 95% CI 6.23 to 9.97) and postnatally (MD 3.70, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.44).
