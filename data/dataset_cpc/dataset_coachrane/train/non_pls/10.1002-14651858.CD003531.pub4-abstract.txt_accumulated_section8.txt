Background
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the repetitive closure of the upper airway during sleep. This results in disturbed sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. It is a risk factor for long‐term cardiovascular morbidity. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines can be applied during sleep. They deliver air pressure by a nasal or oronasal mask to prevent the airway from closing, reducing sleep disturbance and improving sleep quality. Some people find them difficult to tolerate because of high pressure levels and other symptoms such as a dry mouth. Switching to machines that vary the level of air pressure required to reduce sleep disturbance could increase comfort and promote more regular use. Humidification devices humidify the air that is delivered to the upper airway through the CPAP circuit. Humidification may reduce dryness of the throat and mouth and thus improve CPAP tolerability. This updated Cochrane Review looks at modifying the delivery of positive pressure and humidification on machine usage and other clinical outcomes in OSA. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of positive pressure modification or humidification on increasing CPAP machine usage in adults with OSA. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Airways Specialised Register and clinical trials registries on 15 October 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised parallel group or cross‐over trials in adults with OSA. We included studies that compared automatically adjusting CPAP (auto‐CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (bi‐PAP), CPAP with expiratory pressure relief (CPAPexp), heated humidification plus fixed CPAP, automatically adjusting CPAP with expiratory pressure relief, Bi‐PAP with expiratory pressure relief, auto bi‐PAP and CPAPexp with wakefulness detection with fixed pressure setting.
