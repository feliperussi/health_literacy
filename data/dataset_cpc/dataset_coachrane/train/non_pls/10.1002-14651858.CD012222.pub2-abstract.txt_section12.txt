We included two studies with a total of 40 participants in the review. Exercise‐based CR consisted of aerobic or resistance training or both three times per week for six to eight weeks. Exercise intensity was 50% of oxygen consumption (VO2) reserve, or ranged from 60% to 80% of heart rate reserve. Two serious adverse events were observed in one trial, in which participants did not complete the study due to infections. Furthermore, a total of four participants in each group required visits to the emergency department, although these participants did complete the study. Summary scores from the 36‐item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36) and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) were measured as quality of life. One trial reported that the KCCQ summary score improved by 14.4 points in the exercise group compared with 0.5 points in the usual care group. The other trial reported that the SF‐36 total score improved by 29.2 points in the exercise group compared with 16.3 points in the usual care group. A large difference in quality of life was observed between groups at the end of follow‐up (standardised mean difference 0.88, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 1.88; 37 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality of evidence). However, there was no evidence for the effectiveness of exercise‐based CR due to the young age of the participants, high risk of performance bias, very small sample size, and wide confidence intervals, which resulted in very low‐quality evidence. Furthermore, we were not able to determine the effect of exercise‐based CR on mortality, rehospitalisation, heart transplantation, and cost, as these outcomes were not reported.
