Background
Neuralgic amyotrophy (also know as Parsonage‐Turner syndrome or brachial plexus neuritis) is a distinct peripheral nervous system disorder characterised by episodes (attacks) of extreme neuropathic pain and rapid multifocal weakness and atrophy in the upper limbs. Neuralgic amyotrophy has both an idiopathic and hereditary form, with similar clinical symptoms but generally an earlier age of onset and more episodes in the hereditary form. The current hypothesis is that neuralgic amyotrophy is caused by an underlying genetic predisposition and a susceptibility to mechanical injury of the brachial plexus, and that the episodes are then caused by an immune‐mediated response to the brachial plexus. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is genetically heterogeneous and is associated with a point mutation or duplication of the SEPT9 gene on chromosome 17q25 in 55% of the families. In the idiopathic form an underlying but as yet unknown genetic predisposition is also assumed. 
Recovery is slow, in months to years, and many patients are left with residual pain and decreased exercise tolerance in the affected limb(s). Anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may relieve pain or help improve functional recovery. This is an update of a review first published in 2009. 
Objectives
The objective was to provide a systematic review of all randomised clinical trials of treatment in neuralgic amyotrophy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (17 May 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to May 2011), and LILACS (January 1982 to May 2011) for randomised controlled trials of treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy.
