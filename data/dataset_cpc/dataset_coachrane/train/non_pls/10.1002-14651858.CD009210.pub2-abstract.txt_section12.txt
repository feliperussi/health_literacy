We included seven RCTs with a total of 571 participants in the review. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non‐cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The intervention was started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one trial. We considered all seven RCTs to carry a high risk of bias. The effects of ACEIs or ARBs on perioperative mortality and acute myocardial infarction were uncertain because the quality of the evidence was very low. The risk of death was 2.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 1.6% in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 5.85). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was 1.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 3.0% in the placebo group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). ACEIs or ARBs may improve congestive heart failure (cardiac index) perioperatively (mean difference (MD) ‐0.60; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.50, very low‐quality evidence). In terms of rate of complications, there was no difference in perioperative cerebrovascular complications (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28, very low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.41, very low‐quality evidence). Cardiac surgery‐related renal failure was not reported. ACEIs or ARBs were associated with shortened length of hospital stay (MD ‐0.54; 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.16, P value = 0.005, very low‐quality evidence). These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to likely confounding by the clinical backgrounds of the participants. ACEIs or ARBs may shorten the length of hospital stay, (MD ‐0.54; 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.16, very low‐quality evidence) Two studies reported adverse events, and there was no evidence of a difference between the ACEIs or ARBs and control groups.
