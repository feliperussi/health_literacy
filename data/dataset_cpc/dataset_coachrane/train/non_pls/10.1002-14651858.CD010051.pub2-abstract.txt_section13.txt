Eighteen trials compared topical CsA 0.05% plus artificial tears versus vehicle plus artificial tears or artificial tears alone. One trial reported subjective symptoms of dry eye at 6 months and the results were in favor of CsA (mean difference (MD) ‐4.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.41 to ‐3.19; low‐certainty evidence). Two trials reported MD in ocular surface dye staining at 6 months, but the results were inconsistent in these two trials (MD −0.35, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.01 in one and MD 0.58, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.10 in the other; low‐certainty evidence). Four trials reported MD in Schirmer test scores at 6 months and the estimates ranged from ‐4.05 (95% CI ‐6.67 to ‐1.73) to 3.26 (95% CI ‐1.52 to 5.00) (low‐certainty evidence). Three trials reported risk ratio (RR) of improved Schirmer test scores at 6 months; estimates ranged from 0.98 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.17) to 3.50 (95% CI 2.09 to 5.85) (low‐certainty evidence). Four trials reported MD in tear film stability measured by tear break‐up time at 6 months and the estimates ranged from ‐1.98 (95% CI ‐3.59 to ‐0.37) to 1.90 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.36) (low‐certainty evidence). Three trials reported RR of improved tear break‐up time at 6 months and the estimates ranged from 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.04) to 4.00 (95% CI 2.25 to 7.12) (low‐certainty evidence). Three trials reported frequency of artificial tear usage at 6 months without providing any estimates of effect; the direction of effect seem to be in favor of CsA (low‐certainty evidence). Because of incomplete reporting of the results data or considerable statistical heterogeneity, we were only able to perform a meta‐analysis on mean conjunctival goblet cell density. Mean conjunctival goblet cell density in the CsA treated group may be greater than that in the control group at the end of follow‐up at four and 12 months (MD 22.5 cells per unit, 95% CI 16.3 to 28.8; low‐certainty evidence). All but two trials reported adverse events that included burning and stinging. Participants treated with CsA may be more likely to have treatment‐related adverse events than those who treated with vehicle (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.78; low‐certainty evidence).
