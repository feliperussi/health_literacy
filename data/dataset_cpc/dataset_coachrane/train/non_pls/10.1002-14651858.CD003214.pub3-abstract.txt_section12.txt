For this update, we identified one new randomised controlled trial investigating effects of bronchodilators in preterm infants. This study, which enrolled 73 infants but reported on 52 infants, examined prevention of CLD with the use of aminophylline. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was very low. One previously included study enrolled 173 infants to look at prevention of CLD with the use of salbutamol. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was moderate. We found no eligible trial that studied the use of bronchodilator therapy for treatment of individuals with CLD. Prophylaxis with salbutamol led to no statistically significant differences in mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.31; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.11) nor in CLD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; RD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.17). Results showed no statistically significant differences in other complications associated with CLD nor in preterm birth. Investigators in this study did not comment on side effects due to salbutamol. Prophylaxis with aminophylline led to a significant reduction in CLD at 28 days of life (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; RD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.56 to ‐0.13; NNTB 3, 95% CI 2 to 8) and no significant difference in mortality (RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.33 to 26.99; RD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.22), along with a significantly shorter dependency on supplementary oxygen in the aminophylline group compared with the no treatment group (MD ‐17.75 days, 95% CI ‐27.56 to ‐7.94). Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses, as each meta‐analysis included only one study.
