Background
Starting in late 2019, COVID‐19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, spread around the world. Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. 
Search methods
On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. 
We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews.
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings.
