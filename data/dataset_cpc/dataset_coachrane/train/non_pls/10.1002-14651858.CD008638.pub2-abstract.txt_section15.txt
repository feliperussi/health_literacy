We pooled summary estimates from 10 trials evaluating SmartCare™ involving 654 participants. Overall, eight trials were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and two trials were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared with non‐automated strategies, SmartCare™ decreased weaning time (mean difference (MD) ‐2.68 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.99 to ‐1.37; P value < 0.0001, seven trials, 495 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), time to successful extubation (MD ‐0.99 days, 95% CI ‐1.89 to ‐0.09; P value 0.03, seven trials, 516 participants, low‐quality evidence), length of ICU stay (MD ‐5.70 days, 95% CI ‐10.54 to ‐0.85; P value 0.02, six trials, 499 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) and proportions of participants receiving ventilation for longer than seven and 21 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; P value 0.01 and RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86; P value 0.02). SmartCare™ reduced the total duration of ventilation (MD ‐1.68 days, 95% CI ‐3.33 to ‐0.03; P value 0.05, seven trials, 521 participants, low‐quality evidence) and the number of participants receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.00; P value 0.05); however the estimated effects were imprecise. SmartCare™ had no effect on time to first successful SBT, mortality or adverse events, specifically reintubation. Subgroup analysis suggested that trials with protocolized (versus non‐protocolized) control weaning strategies reported significantly shorter ICU stays. Sensitivity analysis excluded two trials with high risk of bias and supported a trend toward significant reductions in weaning time favouring SmartCare™.
