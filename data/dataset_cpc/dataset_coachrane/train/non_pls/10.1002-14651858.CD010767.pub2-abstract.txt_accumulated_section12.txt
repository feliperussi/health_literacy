Background
Anaemia is a global public health problem. Children under five years of age living in developing countries (mostly Africa and South‐East Asia) are highly affected. Although the causes for anaemia are multifactorial, malaria has been linked to anaemia in children living in malaria‐endemic areas. Administering intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment (IPT) to children might reduce anaemia, since it could protect children from new Plasmodium parasite infection (the parasites that cause malaria) and allow their haemoglobin levels to recover. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of IPT for children with anaemia living in malaria‐endemic areas.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform and metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for ongoing trials up to 4 December 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of IPT on children with anaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed data by conducting meta‐analyses, stratifying data according to whether participants received iron supplements or not. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Six trials with 3847 participants met our inclusion criteria. Trials were conducted in areas of low malaria endemicity (three trials), and moderate to high endemicity (three trials). Four trials were in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Iron was given to all children in two trials, and evaluated in a factorial design in a further two trials.
