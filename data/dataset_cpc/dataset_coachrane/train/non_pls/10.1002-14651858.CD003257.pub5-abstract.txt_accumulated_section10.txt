Background
Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low‐income countries. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta2‐adrenergic agonists, pertussis‐specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults. 
Search methods
We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2), accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to 30 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 30 January 2014), AMED (1985 to 30 January 2014), CINAHL (1980 to 30 January 2014) and LILACS (30 January 2014). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay.
