Background
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important agents in the management of arthritic and inflammatory conditions, and are among the most frequently prescribed medications in North America and Europe. However, there is overwhelming evidence linking these agents to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. 
Objectives
To review the effectiveness of common interventions for the prevention of NSAID induced upper GI toxicity. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to May 2009, Current Contents for six months prior to May 2009, EMBASE to May 2009, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1973 to May 2009. Recent conference proceedings were reviewed and content experts and companies were contacted. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of prostaglandin analogues (PA), H2‐receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper GI toxicity were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent authors extracted data regarding population characteristics, study design, methodological quality and number of participants with endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall drop‐outs, drop outs due to symptoms. Dichotomous data were pooled using RevMan 5.0. Heterogeneity was evaluated using a chi square test, and the I square statistic. 
Main results
Forty‐one RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 ug/day was superior to 400 ug/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR 0.17, and RR 0.39 respectively, P=0.0055). A dose response relationship was not seen with duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhoea at all doses, although significantly more at 800 ug/day than 400 ug/day (P=0.0012). Misoprostol also reduced the risk of clinical ulcer complications.
