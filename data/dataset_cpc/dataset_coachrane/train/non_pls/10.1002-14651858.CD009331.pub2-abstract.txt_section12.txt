Two identified studies randomly assigned a total of 122 participants with neurological conditions comparing PMs versus no PMs. Data from 121 participants were available for analysis. Both studies had a low risk of bias. One within‐participant study involving 20 participants (40 limbs) measured ankle joint mobility and reported a mean between‐group difference of four degrees (95% confidence interval (CI), two to six degrees) favouring the experimental group. Both studies measured spasticity with the Modified Ashworth Scale, but the results were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity. Neither study reported a clinically or statistically relevant reduction in spasticity with PMs. In one study, the mean difference on a tallied 48‐point Modified Ashworth Scale for the upper limbs was one of 48 points (95% CI minus two to four points), and in the other study, the median difference on a six‐point Modified Ashworth Scale for the ankle plantar flexor muscles was zero points (95% CI minus one to zero points). In both studies, a negative between‐group difference indicated a reduction in spasticity in the experimental group compared with the control group. One study with a total of 102 participants investigated the short‐term effects on pain. The mean difference on a zero to 24‐point pain scale was ‐0.4 points in favour of the control group (95% CI ‐1.4 to 0.6 points). The GRADE level of evidence about the effects of PMs on joint mobility, spasticity and pain is very low. Neither study examined quality of life, activity limitations or participation restrictions or reported any adverse events.
