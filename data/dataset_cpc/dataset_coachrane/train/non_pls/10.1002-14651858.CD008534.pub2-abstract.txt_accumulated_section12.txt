Background
Perineal tears commonly occur during childbirth. They are sutured most of the time. Surgical repair can be associated with adverse outcomes, such as pain, discomfort and interference with normal activities during puerperium and possibly breastfeeding. Surgical repair also has an impact on clinical workload and human and financial resources. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence for surgical versus non‐surgical management of first‐ and second‐degree perineal tears sustained during childbirth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 May 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4) and MEDLINE (Jan 1966 to 2 May 2011). We also searched the reference lists of reviews, guidelines and other publications and contacted authors of identified eligible trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect on clinical outcomes of suturing versus non‐suturing techniques to repair first‐ and second‐degree perineal tears sustained during childbirth. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Three review authors independently extracted data. 
Main results
We included two RCTs (involving 154 women) with a low risk of bias. It was not possible to pool the available studies. The two studies do not consistently report outcomes defined in the review. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups (surgical versus non‐surgical repair) in incidence of pain and wound complications, self‐evaluated measures of pain at hospital discharge and postpartum and re‐initiation of sexual activity. Differences in the use of analgesia varied between the studies, being high in the sutured group in one study. The other trial showed differences in wound closure and poor wound approximation in the non‐suturing group, but noted incidentally also that more women were breastfeeding in this group.
