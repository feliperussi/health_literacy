Seven randomised control trials were identified. No RCTs comparing infertility surgery versus no treatment or alternative treatments were found. There was no RCT found investigating the use of magnification for tubal surgery.  There was no evidence for or against the use of a CO2 laser compared with standard techniques for adhesiolysis (OR for pregnancy 1.07, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.87) or salpingostomy (OR for pregnancy 1.38, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.05) from two RCTs.  One RCT randomised women for salpingostomatolysis by laparotomy and laparoscopy using the classic approach or the one suture technique. There was no evidence of benefit or disadvantage when laparoscopy was compared to laparotomy. The OR for bilateral tubal patency was 1.32 (95% CI 0.55 to 3.22) and unilateral tubal patency OR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.29 to 2.29). The pregnancy rate was not reported.  There was no evidence of benefit or disadvantage from two RCTs assessing the use of a prosthesis at salpingostomy compared with non‚Äêuse (combined odds of pregnancy (term) in group using the prosthesis as compared to the control (OR for pregnancy at term 1.17, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.93).  There was no evidence of benefit or disadvantage difference in one RCT comparing Cuff versus Bruhat technique for salpingostomy One RCT compared two methods of salpingostomy (OR for pregnancy rate ( intrauterine) 1.02, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.61).  One RCT showed no evidence of benefit or disadvantage for the use of thermocoagulation or electrocoagulation at adhesiolysis, odds for pregnancy rate between the two groups OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.46).
