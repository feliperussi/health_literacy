Meta‐analysis of rTMS studies versus sham for pain intensity at short‐term follow‐up (0 to < 1 week postintervention), (27 studies, involving 655 participants), demonstrated a small effect with heterogeneity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.29 to ‐0.16, low‐quality evidence). This equates to a 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) reduction in pain, or a 0.40 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.32) point reduction on a 0 to 10 pain intensity scale, which does not meet the minimum clinically important difference threshold of 15% or greater. Pre‐specified subgroup analyses did not find a difference between low‐frequency stimulation (low‐quality evidence) and rTMS applied to the prefrontal cortex compared to sham for reducing pain intensity at short‐term follow‐up (very low‐quality evidence). High‐frequency stimulation of the motor cortex in single‐dose studies was associated with a small short‐term reduction in pain intensity at short‐term follow‐up (low‐quality evidence, pooled n = 249, SMD ‐0.38 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.27). This equates to a 12% (95% CI 9% to 16%) reduction in pain, or a 0.77 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.99) point change on a 0 to 10 pain intensity scale, which does not achieve the minimum clinically important difference threshold of 15% or greater. The results from multiple‐dose studies were heterogeneous and there was no evidence of an effect in this subgroup (very low‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence that rTMS improved disability. Meta‐analysis of studies of rTMS versus sham for quality of life (measured using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) at short‐term follow‐up demonstrated a positive effect (MD ‐10.80 95% CI ‐15.04 to ‐6.55, low‐quality evidence).
