Background
Every year nearly 400,000 children are infected with HIV through mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT), which is responsible for more than 90% of HIV infections in children. In high‐income countries, the MTCT rate is less than 1% through perinatal prevention of mother‐to‐child HIV transmission (PMTCT) interventions. In low‐ and middle‐income countries, PMTCT programme coverage remains low and consequently transmission rate high. The World Health Organisation recommends integration of PMTCT programmes with other healthcare services to increase access and improve uptake of these interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of integration of perinatal PMTCT measures with other health care services on coverage and service uptake compared to stand‐alone PMTCT programmes and healthcare services or partially integrated PMTCT interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases, for the time period of January 1990 to August 2010: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the WHO Global Health Library, CAB abstracts, CINAHL, POPLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, ERIC, AEGIS, Google Scholar, New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature, Open SIGLE, British Library Catalogue, ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database and U.S. National Library of Medicine Gateway system. We also searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7), Database of Abstracts of Reviews on Effects (the Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 7). We also searched for ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and Controlled clinical trials (January 1990 to July 2010). We performed ISI Web of Knowledge Cited Reference Search and scanned the reference lists of the included articles for additional relevant studies. We contacted authors to locate additional eligible studies. To maximise sensitivity we did not employ any methodological filters.
