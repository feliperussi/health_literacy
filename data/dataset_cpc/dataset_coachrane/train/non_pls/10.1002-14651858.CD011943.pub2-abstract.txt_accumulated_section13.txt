Background
Many individuals who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience a range of distressing and debilitating symptoms. These can include positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech), cognitive symptoms (such as trouble focusing or paying attention or using information to make decisions), and negative symptoms (such as diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, and anhedonia). Antipsychotic drugs are often only partially effective, particularly in treating negative symptoms, indicating the need for additional treatment. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant drug that when taken in addition to an antipsychotic may offer some benefit for negative symptoms. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effects of mirtazapine as adjunct treatment for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) up to May 2018. 
Selection criteria
All randomised‐controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data focusing on mirtazapine adjunct for people with schizophrenia. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. For included studies we assessed risk of bias and created 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs with a total of 310 participants. All studies compared mirtazapine adjunct with placebo adjunct and were of short‐term duration. We considered five studies to have a high risk of bias for either incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, or other bias. 
Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in mental state (negative and positive symptoms), leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in global state, clinically important change in quality of life, number of days in hospital and incidence of serious adverse events.
