Background
Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to tobacco dependence and long‐term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015.
Selection criteria
Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow‐up of at least six months. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method. 
Main results
We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control.
