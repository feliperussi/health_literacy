Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have many negative perioperative effects. It has been suggested that the administration of analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. We defined pre‐emptive nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatories (NSAIDs) as those given before surgery but not continued afterwards and preventive NSAIDs as those given before surgery and continued afterwards. These were compared to a control group given the NSAIDs after surgery instead of before surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive NSAIDs for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL (up to June 2020). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included adult participants undergoing any type of surgery. We defined pre‐emptive NSAIDs as those given before surgery but not continued afterwards and preventive NSAIDs as those given before surgery and continued afterwards. These were compared to a control group given the NSAIDs after surgery instead of before surgery. We included studies that gave the medication by any route but not given on the skin. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods expected by Cochrane, as well as a novel publication bias test developed by our research group. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Outcomes included acute postoperative pain (minimal clinically important difference (MCID): 1.5 on a 0‐10 scale), adverse events of NSAIDs, nausea and vomiting, 24‐hour morphine consumption (MCID: 10 mg reduction), time to analgesic request (MCID: one hour), pruritus, sedation, patient satisfaction, chronic pain and time to first bowel movement (MCID: 12 hours). 
Main results
We included 71 RCTs. Seven studies are awaiting classification. We included 45 studies that evaluated pre‐emptive NSAIDs and 26 studies that evaluated preventive NSAIDs. We considered only four studies to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The operations and NSAIDs used varied, although most studies were conducted in abdominal, orthopaedic and dental surgery. Most studies were conducted in secondary care and in low‐risk participants. Common exclusions were participants on analgesic medications prior to surgery and those with chronic pain. 
Pre‐emptive NSAIDs compared to post‐incision NSAIDs 
For pre‐emptive NSAIDs, there is probably a decrease in early acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.69, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.41; studies = 36; participants = 2032; I2 = 96%; moderate‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies that reported on acute postoperative pain reported adverse events as an outcome. There may be little or no difference between the groups in short‐term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; studies = 2; participants = 100; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence) or long‐term nausea and vomiting (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; studies = 5; participants = 228; I2 = 29%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.00; studies = 28; participants = 1645; I2 = 97%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption with pre‐emptive NSAIDs (MD ‐5.62 mg, 95% CI ‐9.00 mg to ‐2.24 mg; studies = 16; participants = 854; I2 = 99%; low‐certainty evidence) and an increase in the time to analgesic request (MD 17.04 minutes, 95% CI 3.77 minutes to 30.31 minutes; studies = 18; participants = 975; I2 = 95%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in opioid adverse events such as pruritus (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.76; studies = 4; participants = 254; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence) or sedation (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.68; studies = 4; participants = 281; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence), although the number of included studies for these outcomes was small. No study reported patient satisfaction, chronic pain or time to first bowel movement for pre‐emptive NSAIDs.
