Background
Governments use different approaches to ensure that private for‐profit healthcare services meet certain quality standards. Such government guidance, referred to as public stewardship, encompasses government policies, regulatory mechanisms, and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in the delivery of services. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) have not been the subject of a systematic review. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of public sector regulation, training, or co‐ordination of the private for‐profit health sector in low‐ and middle‐income countries.
