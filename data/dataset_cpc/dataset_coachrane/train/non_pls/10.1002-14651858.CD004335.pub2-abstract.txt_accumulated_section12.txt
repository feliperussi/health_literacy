Background
Burns and scalds are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Successful counter‐measures to prevent burn and scald‐related injury have been identified. However, evidence indicating the successful roll‐out of these counter‐measures into the wider community is lacking. Community‐based interventions in the form of multi‐strategy, multi‐focused programmes are hypothesised to result in a reduction in population‐wide injury rates. This review tests this hypothesis with regards to burn and scald injury in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based interventions, defined as coordinated, multi‐strategy initiatives, for reducing burns and scalds in children aged 14 years and under. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, National Research Register and the Web of Knowledge. We also handsearched selected journals and checked the reference lists of selected publications. The searches were last updated in May 2007. 
Selection criteria
Included studies were those that reported changes in medically attended burn and scald‐related injury rates in a paediatric population (aged 14 years and under), following the implementation of a controlled community‐based intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assess studies for eligibility and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity between the included studies, a pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Of 39 identified studies, four met the criteria for inclusion. Two of the included studies reported a significant decrease in paediatric burn and scald injury in the intervention compared with the control communities. The failure of the other two studies to show a positive result may have been due to limited time‐frame for the intervention and/or failure to adequately implement the counter‐measures in the communities.
