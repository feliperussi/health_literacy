Background
Cancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long‐term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer. 
Search methods
We conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long‐term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all‐cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health‐related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook). 
Main results
Of 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria.
Low molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta‐analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate‐certainty evidence). Meta‐analysis of four studies did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on major bleeding (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more, moderate‐certainty evidence) or minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; RD 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 92 fewer to 47 more; low‐certainty evidence), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69). Meta‐analysis of five studies showed that LMWHs probably reduced the recurrence of VTE compared to VKAs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; RD 53 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 29 fewer to 72 fewer, moderate‐certainty evidence).
