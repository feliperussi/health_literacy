====================================
At the end of 1998 over 33 million people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and over one million children had been infected from their mothers. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess what interventions may be effective in decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection as well as their effect on neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidity. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing any intervention aimed at decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection compared with placebo or no treatment, or any two or more interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV infection. 
Data collection and analysis
Trial quality assessments and data extraction were undertaken by the reviewer.
Main results
Zidovudine  Four trials comparing zidovudine with placebo involving 1585 participants were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission with any zidovudine (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42‐0.69). There is no evidence that 'long course therapy' is superior to 'short course therapy'. 
Nevirapine  One trial compared intrapartum and postnatal nevirapine with intrapartum and postnatal zidovudine in 626 women, the majority of whom breast fed their infants. Compared with zidovudine, there was a significant reduction in the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV with nevirapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40‐0.83). No trials are available comparing nevirapine with placebo.
