Four trials (involving a total of 269 participants) were included. The participants were children with cystic fibrosis and their parents or caregivers in three trials and adults with cystic fibrosis in one trial. The trials compared four different self‐management education interventions versus standard treatment: (1) a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis in general; (2) education specific to aerosol and airway clearance treatments; (3) disease‐specific nutrition education; and (4) general and disease‐specific nutrition education. Training children to manage cystic fibrosis in general had no statistically significant effects on weight after six to eight weeks, mean difference ‐7.74 lb (i.e. 3.51 kg) (95% confidence interval ‐35.18 to 19.70). General and disease‐specific nutrition education for adults had no statistically significant effects on: pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at one second), mean difference ‐5.00 % (95% confidence interval ‐18.10 to 8.10) at six months and mean difference ‐5.50 % (95% confidence interval ‐18.46 to 7.46) at 12 months; or weight, mean difference ‐ 0.70 kg (95% confidence interval ‐6.58 to 5.18) at six months and mean difference ‐0.70 kg (95% confidence interval ‐6.62 to 5.22) at 12 months; or dietary fat intake scores, mean difference 1.60 (85% confidence interval ‐2.90 to 6.10) at six months and mean difference 0.20 (95% confidence interval ‐4.08 to 4.48) at 12 months. There is some limited evidence to suggest that self‐management education may improve knowledge in patients with cystic fibrosis but not in parents or caregivers. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that self‐management education may result in positively changing a small number of behaviours in both patients and caregivers.
