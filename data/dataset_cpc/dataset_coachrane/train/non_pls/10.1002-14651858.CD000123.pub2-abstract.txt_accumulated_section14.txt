Background
Lipid‐lowering therapy is recommended for secondary prevention in people with coronary artery disease. It may also reduce cardiovascular events and/or local disease progression in people with lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of lipid‐lowering therapy on all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular events and local disease progression in patients with PAD of the lower limb. 
Search methods
The authors searched The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialised Register (last searched February 2007) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last searched Issue 2, 2007) for publications describing randomised controlled trials of lipid‐lowering therapy in peripheral arterial disease of the lower limb. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of lipid‐lowering therapy in patients with PAD of the lower limb. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
Main results
Eighteen trials were included, involving a total of 10,049 participants. Trials differed considerably in their inclusion criteria, outcomes measured, and type of lipid‐lowering therapy used. Only one trial (PQRST) reported a detrimental effect of active treatment on blood lipid/lipoprotein levels. 
The pooled results from all eligible trials indicated that lipid‐lowering therapy had no statistically significant effect on overall mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.50) or on total cardiovascular events (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09). However, subgroup analysis which excluded PQRST showed that lipid‐lowering therapy significantly reduced the risk of total cardiovascular events (OR 0.74; CI 0.55 to 0.98). This was primarily due to a positive effect on total coronary events (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87). Greatest evidence of effectiveness came from the use of simvastatin in people with a blood cholesterol ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre (HPS). 
Pooling of the results from several small trials on a range of different lipid‐lowering agents indicated an improvement in total walking distance (Mean Difference (MD) 152 m; 95% CI 32.11 to 271.88) and pain‐free walking distance (WMD 89.76 m; 95% CI 30.05 to 149.47) but no significant impact on ankle brachial index (WMD 0.04; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.09).
