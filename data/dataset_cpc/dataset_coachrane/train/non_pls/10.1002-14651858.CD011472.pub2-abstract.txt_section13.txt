None of the studies reported on mortality (total or cardiovascular) or cardiovascular events. Results on lipids suggest there is a significant beneficial effect of increased fibre on total cholesterol levels (17 trials (20 comparisons), 1067 participants randomised, mean difference ‐0.20 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.34 to ‐0.06), and LDL cholesterol levels (mean difference ‐0.14 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.22 to ‐0.06) but not on triglyceride levels (mean difference 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.05), and there was a very small but statistically significant decrease rather than increase in HDL levels with increased fibre intake (mean difference ‐0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.06 to ‐0.01). Fewer studies (10 trials, 661 participants randomised) reported blood pressure outcomes where there is a significant effect of increased fibre consumption on diastolic blood pressure (mean difference ‐1.77 mmHg, 95% CI ‐2.61 to ‐0.92) whilst there is a reduction in systolic blood pressure with fibre but this does not reach statistical significance (mean difference ‐1.92 mmHg, 95% CI ‐4.02 to 0.19). There did not appear to be any subgroup effects by the nature of the type of intervention (fibre supplements or provision of foods/advice to increase fibre consumption) or the type of fibre (soluble/insoluble) although the number of studies contributing to each subgroup were small. All analyses need to be viewed with caution given the risks of bias observed for total cholesterol and the statistical heterogeneity observed for systolic blood pressure. Adverse events, where reported, appeared to mostly reflect mild to moderate gastrointestinal side‐effects and these were generally reported more in the fibre intervention groups than the control groups.
