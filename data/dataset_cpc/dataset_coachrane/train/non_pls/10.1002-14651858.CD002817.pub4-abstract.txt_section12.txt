We identified 39 trials with 1827 participants. We considered the trials to be at a mixed risk of bias as the result of unreported allocation concealment and probable detection bias. Compared with no intervention, physiotherapy significantly improved the gait outcomes of speed (mean difference 0.04 m/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.06, P = 0.0002); two‐ or six‐minute walk test (13.37 m, 95% CI 0.55 to 26.20, P = 0.04) and Freezing of Gait questionnaire (‐1.41, 95% CI ‐2.63 to ‐0.19, P = 0.02); functional mobility and balance outcomes of Timed Up & Go test (‐0.63 s, 95% CI ‐1.05 to ‐0.21, P = 0.003), Functional Reach Test (2.16 cm, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.43, P = 0.0008), and Berg Balance Scale (3.71 points, 95% CI 2.30 to 5.11, P < 0.00001); and clinician‐rated disability using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (total ‐6.15 points, 95% CI‐8.57 to ‐3.73, P < 0.00001; activities of daily living: ‐1.36, 95% CI ‐2.41 to ‐0.30, P = 0.01; and motor: ‐5.01, 95% CI ‐6.30 to ‐3.72, P < 0.00001). No difference between arms was noted in falls (Falls Efficacy Scale: ‐1.91 points, 95% CI ‐4.76 to 0.94, P = 0.19) or patient‐rated quality of life (PDQ‐39 Summary Index: ‐0.38 points, 95% CI ‐2.58 to 1.81, P = 0.73). One study reported that adverse events were rare; no other studies reported data on this outcome. Indirect comparisons of the different physiotherapy interventions revealed no evidence that the treatment effect differed across physiotherapy interventions for any of the outcomes assessed.
