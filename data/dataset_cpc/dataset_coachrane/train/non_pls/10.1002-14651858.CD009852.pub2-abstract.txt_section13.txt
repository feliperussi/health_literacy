The meta‐analyses provided low‐quality evidence that MET provided no additional benefit when added to other therapies on the outcomes of chronic pain and disability in the short‐term (weighted mean difference (WMD) for pain 0.00, 95% CI ‐2.97 to 2.98 on a 100‐point scale; standardised mean difference (SMD) for disability ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.08, 7 studies, 232 participants). There was low‐quality evidence that MET produced no clinically relevant differences in pain compared to sham MET (mean difference (MD) 14.20, 95% CI ‐10.14 to 38.54, 1 study, 20 participants). For the comparison of MET to other conservative therapies for acute non‐specific LBP, there was very low‐quality evidence of no clinically relevant difference for the outcomes of pain (MD ‐10.72, 95% CI ‐32.57 to 11.13, 2 studies, 88 participants) and functional status (MD 0.87, 95% CI ‐6.31 to 8.05, 1 study, 60 participants). For the comparison of MET to other conservative therapies for chronic non‐specific LBP, there was low‐quality evidence of no clinically relevant difference for the outcomes of pain (MD ‐9.70, 95% CI ‐20.20 to 0.80, 1 study, 30 participants) and functional status (MD ‐4.10, 95% CI ‐9.53 to 1.33, 1 study, 30 participants). There was low‐quality evidence of no clinically relevant difference for the addition of MET to other interventions for acute non‐specific LBP for the outcome of pain (MD ‐3, 95% CI ‐11.37 to 5.37, 1 study, 40 participants) and low‐quality evidence of an effect in favour of MET for functional status (MD ‐17.6, 95% CI ‐27.05 to ‐8.15, 1 study, 40 participants). For chronic non‐specific LBP, there was low‐quality evidence of an effect in favour of MET for the addition of MET to other interventions for the outcomes of pain (MD ‐34.1, 95% CI ‐38.43 to ‐29.77, 1 study, 30 participants) and functional status (MD ‐22, 95% CI ‐27.41 to ‐16.59, 1 study, 30 participants). Lastly, there was low‐quality evidence of no difference for the addition of MET to another manual intervention compared to the same intervention with other conservative therapies for the outcomes of pain (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐3.03 to 13.43, 1 study, 20 participants) and functional status (MD 6.0, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 12.49, 1 study, 20 participants).
