Four studies with a total of 277 participants were included. These studies assessed the efficacy of FMT for treatment of UC in adults; no eligible trials were found for the treatment of CD. Most participants had mild to moderate UC. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one study was conducted in Canada, and another in the Netherlands. Three of the included studies administered FMT via the rectal route and one study administered FMT via the nasoduodenal route. Three studies were rated as low risk of bias. One study (abstract publication) was rated as unclear risk of bias. Combined results from four studies (277 participants) suggest that FMT increases rates of clinical remission by two‐fold in patients with UC compared to controls. At 8 weeks, 37% (52/140) of FMT participants achieved remission compared to 18% (24/137) of control participants (RR 2.03, 95 % CI, 1.07 to 3.86; I² = 50%; low certainty evidence). One study reported data on relapse at 12 weeks among participants who achieved remission. None of the FMT participants (0/7) relapsed at 12 weeks compared to 20% of control participants (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.98, 17 participants, very low certainty evidence). It is unclear whether there is a difference in serious adverse event rates between the intervention and control groups. Seven per cent (10/140) of FMT participants had a serious adverse event compared to 5% (7/137) of control participants (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.58; 4 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events included worsening of UC necessitating intravenous steroids or surgery; infection such as Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus, small bowel perforation and pneumonia. Adverse events were reported by two studies and the pooled data did not show any difference between the study groups. Seventy‐eight per cent (50/64) of FMT participants had an adverse event compared to 75% (49/65) of control participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31; I² = 31%; moderate certainty evidence). Common adverse events included abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, bloating, upper respiratory tract infection, headaches, dizziness, and fever. Four studies reported on clinical response at 8 weeks. Forty‐nine per cent (68/140) of FMT participants had a clinical response compared to 28% (38/137) of control participants (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.95, I² = 50%, low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission at 8 weeks was reported by three studies and the combined results favored FMT over the control group. Thirty per cent (35/117) of FMT participants achieved endoscopic remission compared to 10% (11/112) of control participants (RR 2.96, 95 % CI 1.60 to 5.48, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence).
