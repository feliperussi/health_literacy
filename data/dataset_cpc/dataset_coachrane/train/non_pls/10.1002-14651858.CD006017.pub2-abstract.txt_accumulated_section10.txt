Background
Advanced renal cell carcinoma has been resistant to drug therapy of different types and new types of drug therapy are needed. Targeted agents inhibit known molecular pathways and have been tested in renal cancer for just over a decade. 
Objectives
1) To provide a systematic and regularly updated review of randomized studies testing targeted agents in advanced renal cell cancer.  2) To identify the type and degree of clinical benefit of targeted agents over the prevailing standard of care. 
Search methods
Period of search: January 2000 to June 2010.  1) Electronic search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.  2) Hand search of international cancer meeting abstracts. 
Selection criteria
Randomized, controlled studies, including a targeted agent in patients with advanced renal cell cancer reporting any pre‐specified cancer outcome by allocation. 
Data collection and analysis
The majority of the standardized search and data extraction was conducted independently by two investigators with subsequent resolution of differences. Handsearching, quality of life and toxicity data extraction, most of the initial analysis, and risk of bias assessment, was carried out by one investigator and verified by additional authors as required. Twenty‐five fully eligible studies tested thirteen different targeted agents in a total of 7484 patients with mostly Stage IV disease; 61% had not received prior systemic treatment. The majority of patients were good performance status (ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) 0 to 1). Most comparisons were each examined in only a single study. Risk of bias was considered low for studies that were placebo‐controlled, had a primary outcome of overall survival, or that evaluated progression by independent radiologic reviewers unaware of the intervention allocation.
