Background
Blood transfusion is used in patients with severe malarial anaemia, but risks adverse reactions, transmission of disease, and is complicated to organize in developing countries. 
Objectives
This review evaluates the effects of routine blood transfusion for severe anaemia on death and adverse outcomes in malarious areas. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), LILACS (April 2010), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers and organizations working in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials of blood transfusion compared with conservative management in malaria‐associated severe anaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
Trials were identified and data extracted by a single reviewer (MM) and checked by a second (HS). Inclusion criteria were applied and data were extracted independently by both reviewers. 
Main results
Two randomized trials of 230 children were included. In the transfusion group, there was a non‐significant tendency towards fewer deaths (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.70), but a trend towards more severe adverse events (RR 8.60, 95% CI 1.11 to 66.43). In one trial by Bojang (1997a) respiratory distress was less common and hospital stay was shorter in the transfusion group (MD 1.88 days, 95% CI 2.41 to 1.35). Subsequent need for urgent blood transfusion was less common in the transfusion group (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.68). Day 28 packed cell volume was less in the transfusion group (MD ‐1.34, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐0.11). There was no information on HIV or Hepatitis B virus transmission. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient data to be sure whether routinely giving blood to clinically stable children with severe anaemia in endemic malarious areas reduces death, or results in higher haematocrit measured at one month.
