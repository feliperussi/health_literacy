Background
Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic disease. It is important to determine if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) given as supplements or added to infant formula prevent the development of allergy. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of higher PUFA intake during infancy to prevent allergic disease.
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 14 September 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 14 September 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a PUFA with no PUFA in infants for the prevention of allergy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. We used fixed‐effect analyses. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
The search found 17 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs on allergic outcomes in infants. Only nine studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes that could be used in meta‐analyses. Of these, there were methodological concerns for eight. 
In infants up to two years of age, meta‐analyses found no difference in incidence of all allergy (1 study, 323 infants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.09; heterogeneity not applicable), asthma (3 studies, 1162 infants; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.35, I2 = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.05, I2 = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (7 studies, 1906 infants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06, I2 = 0%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I2 = 0%) or food allergy (3 studies, 915 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19, I2 = 63%; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02, I2 = 74%). There was a reduction in allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 594 infants; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96, I2 = 6%; RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.08 to ‐0.00, I2 = 54%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 13 to ∞). 
In children aged two to five years, meta‐analysis found no difference in incidence of all allergic disease (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.02, I2 = 43%; RD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.31 to ‐0.00, I2 = 63%; NNTB 6, 95% CI 3 to ∞), asthma (1 study, 89 infants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.02; RD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.02; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 50), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.24, I2 = 0%; RD ‐0.09 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.04, I2 = 24%) or food allergy (1 study, 65 infants; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.25 to 20.68; RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.16; heterogeneity not applicable).
