Background
A huge clinical research database on adjuvant cancer treatment has verified improvements in breast cancer outcomes such as recurrence and mortality rates. On the other hand, adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy impacts on quality of life due to substantial short‐ and long‐term side effects. A number of studies have evaluated the effect of exercise interventions on those side effects. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2006. The original review identified some benefits of physical activity on physical fitness and the resulting capacity for performing activities of daily life. It also identified a lack of evidence for other outcomes, providing clear justification for an updated review. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of aerobic or resistance exercise interventions during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer on treatment‐related side effects such as physical deterioration, fatigue, diminished quality of life, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. 
Search methods
We carried out an updated search in the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register (30 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2015), MEDLINE (1966 to 30 March 2015), and EMBASE (1966 to 30 March 2015). We did not update the original searches in CINAHL (1982 to 2004), SPORTDiscus (1975 to 2004), PsycINFO (1872 to 2003), SIGLE (1880 to 2004), and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (1861 to 2004). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials on 30 March 2015. We screened references in relevant reviews and published clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that examined aerobic or resistance exercise or both in women undergoing adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Published and unpublished trials were eligible. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed data extraction, assessed trials, and graded the methodological quality using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting the third review author. We entered data into Review Manager for analysis. For outcomes assessed with a variety of instruments, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) as a summary statistic for meta‐analysis; for those assessed with the same instrument, we used the mean difference (MD). 
Main results
For this 2015 update we included a total of 32 studies with 2626 randomised women, 8 studies from the original search and 24 studies from the updated search. We found evidence that physical exercise during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer probably improves physical fitness (SMD 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.59; 15 studies; 1310 women; moderate‐quality evidence) and slightly reduces fatigue (SMD ‐0.28, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.16; 19 studies; 1698 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Exercise may lead to little or no improvement in health‐related quality of life (MD 1.10, 95% CI ‐5.28 to 7.48; 1 study; 68 women; low‐quality evidence), a slight improvement in cancer site‐specific quality of life (MD 4.24, 95% CI ‐1.81 to 10.29; 4 studies; 262 women; low‐quality evidence), and an improvement in cognitive function (MD ‐11.55, 95% CI ‐22.06 to ‐1.05; 2 studies; 213 women; low‐quality evidence). Exercise probably leads to little or no difference in cancer‐specific quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.25; 12 studies; 1012 women; moderate‐quality evidence) and little or no difference in depression (SMD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.01; 5 studies; 674 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Evidence for other outcomes ranged from low to moderate quality. Seven trials reported a very small number of adverse events.
