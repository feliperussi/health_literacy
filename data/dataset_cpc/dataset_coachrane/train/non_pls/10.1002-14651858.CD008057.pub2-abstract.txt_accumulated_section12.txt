Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) after saphenous vein graft harvesting is a complication occurring in up to 18% of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). It is not known whether the method of skin closure influences the infection rate. 
Objectives
To compare the rates of SSI and wound dehiscence of staples and sutures for skin closure after saphenous vein graft harvesting for CABG. 
Search methods
For this first update we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 November 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to October Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, November 3, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2011 Week 43); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 28 October 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing staples and sutures for closing leg wounds after vein graft harvesting in patients undergoing CABG were eligible for inclusion in this review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of references identified by the search strategy against the selection criteria and extracted data from eligible trials. Included trials were assessed for the following risks of bias: generation of random allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and freedom from other biases. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included three prospective, randomised studies reporting on a total of 148 leg wounds closed with staples and 175 with sutures after vein graft harvesting in patients undergoing CABG. All trials were of sub‐optimal methodological quality and all trials were at risk of bias. Leg wound infection rate was 10.8% (16/148) after leg wound closure with staples compared with 8% (14/174) with sutures (risk ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.39). Leg wound dehiscence occurred in 9.3% (10/108) of patients after leg wound closure with staples compared with 8.8% (12/137) with sutures (risk ratio 1.05, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.53).
