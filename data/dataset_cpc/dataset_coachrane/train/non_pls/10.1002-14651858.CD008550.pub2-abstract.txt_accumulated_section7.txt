Background
Gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common disorder, characterised by regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus. GOR is a very common presentation in infancy in both primary and secondary care settings. GOR can affect approximately 50% of infants younger than three months old. The natural history of GOR in infancy is generally that of a functional, self‐limiting condition that improves with age; < 5% of children with vomiting or regurgitation continue to have symptoms after infancy. Older children and children with co‐existing medical conditions can have a more protracted course. The definition of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and its precise distinction from GOR are debated, but consensus guidelines from the North American Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition define GORD as 'troublesome symptoms or complications of GOR.' 
Objectives
This Cochrane review aims to provide a robust analysis of currently available pharmacological interventions used to treat children with GOR by assessing all outcomes indicating benefit or harm. 
Search methods
We sought to identify relevant published trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to 2014), the Centralised Information Service for Complementary Medicine (CISCOM), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Science Citation Index (on BIDS—UK General Science Index) and the ISI Web of Science. We also searched for ongoing trials in the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). 
Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were handsearched for relevant paediatric studies on medical treatment of children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux, as were published abstracts from conference proceedings (published in Gut and Gastroenterology) and reviews published over the past five years.No language restrictions were applied.
