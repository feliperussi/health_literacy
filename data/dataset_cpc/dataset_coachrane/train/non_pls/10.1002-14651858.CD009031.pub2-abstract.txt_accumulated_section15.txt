Background
People with febrile neutropaenia are usually treated in a hospital setting. Recently, treatment with oral antibiotics has been proven to be as effective as intravenous therapy. However, the efficacy and safety of outpatient treatment have not been fully evaluated. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy (treatment failure and mortality) and safety (adverse events of antimicrobials) of outpatient treatment compared with inpatient treatment in people with cancer who have low‐risk febrile neutropaenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid (from 1948 to November week 4, 2018), Embase via Ovid (from 1980 to 2018, week 48) and trial registries (National Cancer Institute, MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, Medical Research Council Clinical Trial Directory). We handsearched all references of included studies and major reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outpatient with inpatient treatment for people with cancer who develop febrile neutropaenia. The outpatient group included those who started treatment as an inpatient and completed the antibiotic course at home (sequential) as well as those who started treatment at home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. Primary outcome measures were: treatment failure and mortality; secondary outcome measures considered were: duration of fever, adverse drug reactions to antimicrobial treatment, duration of neutropaenia, duration of hospitalisation, duration of antimicrobial treatment, and quality of life (QoL). We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data; we calculated weighted mean differences for continuous data. Random‐effects meta‐analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. 
Main results
We included ten RCTs, six in adults (628 participants) and four in children (366 participants). We found no clear evidence of a difference in treatment failure between the outpatient and inpatient groups, either in adults (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.85, I2 0%; six studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or children (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.99, I2 0%; four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). For mortality, we also found no clear evidence of a difference either in studies in adults (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.71; six studies; 628 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) or in children (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.70; three studies; 329 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
According to the type of intervention (early discharge or exclusively outpatient), meta‐analysis of treatment failure in four RCTs in adults with early discharge (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.95; P = 0.26, I2 0%; 364 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) was similar to the results of the exclusively outpatient meta‐analysis (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.13; P = 0.65, I2 19%; two studies; 264 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Regarding the secondary outcome measures, we found no clear evidence of a difference between outpatient and inpatient groups in duration of fever (adults: mean difference (MD) 0.2, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.76, 1 study, 169 participants; low‐certainty evidence) (children: MD ‐0.6, 95% CI ‐0.84 to 0.71, 3 studies, 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and in duration of neutropaenia (adults: MD 0.1, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.79, 1 study, 169 participants; low‐certainty evidence) (children: MD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.86 to 0.55, 2 studies, 268 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). With regard to adverse drug reactions, although there was greater frequency in the outpatient group, we found no clear evidence of a difference when compared to the inpatient group, either in adult participants (RR 8.39, 95% CI 0.38 to 187.15; three studies; 375 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or children (RR 1.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.98; two studies; 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Four studies compared the hospitalisation time and found that the mean number of days of hospital stay was lower in the outpatient treated group by 1.64 days in adults (MD ‐1.64, 95% CI ‐2.22 to ‐1.06; 3 studies, 251 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and by 3.9 days in children (MD ‐3.90, 95% CI ‐5.37 to ‐2.43; 1 study, 119 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In the 3 RCTs of children in which days of antimicrobial treatment were analysed, we found no difference between outpatient and inpatient groups (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐1.26 to 1.12; 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence).
