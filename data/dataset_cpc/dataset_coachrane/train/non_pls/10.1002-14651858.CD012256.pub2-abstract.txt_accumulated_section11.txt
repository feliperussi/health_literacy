Background
Edentulism is relatively common and is often treated with the provision of complete or partial removable dentures. Clinicians make final impressions of complete dentures (CD) and removable partial dentures (RPD) using different techniques and materials. Applying the correct impression technique and material, based on an individual's oral condition, improves the quality of the prosthesis, which may improve quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different final‐impression techniques and materials used to make complete dentures, for retention, stability, comfort, and quality of life in completely edentulous people. 
To assess the effects of different final‐impression techniques and materials used to make removable partial dentures, for stability, comfort, overextension, and quality of life in partially edentulous people. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 22 November 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Register of Studies, to 22 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 November 2017), and Embase Ovid (21 December 2015 to 22 November 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases, however the search of Embase was restricted by date due to the Cochrane Centralised Search Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different final‐impression techniques and materials for treating people with complete dentures (CD) and removable partial dentures (RPD). For CD, we included trials that compared different materials or different techniques or both. In RPD for tooth‐supported conditions, we included trials comparing the same material and different techniques, or different materials and the same technique. In tooth‐ and tissue‐supported RPD, we included trials comparing the same material and different dual‐impression techniques, and different materials with different dual‐impression techniques. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently, and in duplicate, screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for each included trial. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the random‐effects model. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables for the main comparisons and outcomes (participant‐reported oral health‐related quality of life, quality of the denture, and denture border adjustments).
