Background
Radiofrequency (RF) denervation, an invasive treatment for chronic low back pain (CLBP), is used most often for pain suspected to arise from facet joints, sacroiliac (SI) joints or discs. Many (uncontrolled) studies have shown substantial variation in its use between countries and continued uncertainty regarding its effectiveness. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of RF denervation procedures for the treatment of patients with CLBP. The current review is an update of the review conducted in 2003. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, three other databases, two clinical trials registries and the reference lists of included studies from inception to May 2014 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilling the inclusion criteria. We updated this search in June 2015, but we have not yet incorporated these results. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs of RF denervation for patients with CLBP who had a positive response to a diagnostic block or discography. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently selected RCTs, extracted data and assessed risk of bias (RoB) and clinical relevance using standardised forms. We performed meta‐analyses with clinically homogeneous studies and assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
In total, we included 23 RCTs (N = 1309), 13 of which (56%) had low RoB. We included both men and women with a mean age of 50.6 years. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence as very low to moderate. Twelve studies examined suspected facet joint pain, five studies disc pain, two studies SI joint pain, two studies radicular CLBP, one study suspected radiating low back pain and one study CLBP with or without suspected radiation. Overall, moderate evidence suggests that facet joint RF denervation has a greater effect on pain compared with placebo over the short term (mean difference (MD) ‐1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.28 to ‐0.67). Low‐quality evidence indicates that facet joint RF denervation is more effective than placebo for function over the short term (MD ‐5.53, 95% CI ‐8.66 to ‐2.40) and over the long term (MD ‐3.70, 95% CI ‐6.94 to ‐0.47). Evidence of very low to low quality shows that facet joint RF denervation is more effective for pain than steroid injections over the short (MD ‐2.23, 95% CI ‐2.38 to ‐2.08), intermediate (MD ‐2.13, 95% CI ‐3.45 to ‐0.81), and long term (MD ‐2.65, 95% CI ‐3.43 to ‐1.88). RF denervation used for disc pain produces conflicting results, with no effects for RF denervation compared with placebo over the short and intermediate term, and small effects for RF denervation over the long term for pain relief (MD ‐1.63, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.68) and improved function (MD ‐6.75, 95% CI ‐13.42 to ‐0.09). Lack of evidence of short‐term effectiveness undermines the clinical plausibility of intermediate‐term or long‐term effectiveness. When RF denervation is used for SI joint pain, low‐quality evidence reveals no differences from placebo in effects on pain (MD ‐2.12, 95% CI ‐5.45 to 1.21) and function (MD ‐14.06, 95% CI ‐30.42 to 2.30) over the short term, and one study shows a small effect on both pain and function over the intermediate term. RF denervation is an invasive procedure that can cause a variety of complications. The quality and size of original studies were inadequate to permit assessment of how often complications occur.
