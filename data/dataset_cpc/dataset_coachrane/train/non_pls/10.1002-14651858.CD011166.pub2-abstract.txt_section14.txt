This study identified no difference in subjective knee score (measured using the average score on four of the five sub‐scales of the KOOS score (range from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms)) between ACL reconstruction and conservative treatment at two years (difference in KOOS‐4 change from baseline scores: MD ‐0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.78 to 6.38; N = 121 participants; low‐quality evidence), or at five years (difference in KOOS‐4 final scores: MD ‐2.0, 95% CI ‐8.27 to 4.27; N = 120 participants; low‐quality evidence). The total number of participants incurring one or more complications in each group was not reported; serious events reported in the surgery group were predominantly surgery‐related, while those in conservative treatment group were predominantly knee instability. There were also incomplete data for total participants with treatment failure, including subsequent surgery. In the surgical group at two years, there was low‐quality evidence of far fewer ACL‐related treatment failures, when defined as either graft rupture or subsequent ACL reconstruction. This result is dominated by the uptake by 39% (23/59) of the participants in the conservative treatment group of ACL reconstruction for knee instability at two years and by 51% (30/59) of the participants at five years. There was low‐quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in participants who had undergone meniscal surgery at anytime up to five years. There was low‐quality evidence of no clinically important between‐group differences in SF‐36 physical component scores at two years. There was low‐quality evidence of a higher return to the same or greater level of sport activity at two years in the ACL reconstruction group, but the wide 95% CI also included the potential for a higher return in the conservative treatment group. Based on an illustrative return to sport activities of 382 per 1000 conservatively treated patients, this amounts to an extra 84 returns per 1000 ACL‐reconstruction patients (95% CI 84 fewer to 348 more). There was very low‐quality evidence of a higher incidence of radiographically‐detected osteoarthritis in the surgery group (19/58 (35%) versus 10/55 (18%)).
