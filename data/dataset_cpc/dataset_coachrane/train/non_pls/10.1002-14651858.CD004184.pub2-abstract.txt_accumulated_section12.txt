Background
Variation in blood pressure levels display circadian rhythms. The morning surge in blood pressure is known to increase the risk of myocardial events in the first several hours post awakening. A systematic review of the administration‐time‐related‐effects of evening versus morning dosing regimen of antihypertensive drugs in the management of patients with primary hypertension has not been conducted. 
Objectives
To evaluate the administration‐time‐related‐effects of antihypertensive drugs administered as once daily monotherapy in the evening versus morning administration regimen on all cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and reduction of blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane CENTRAL on Ovid (4th Quarter 2009), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to October 2009), EMBASE (1974 to October 2009), the Chinese Biomedical literature database (1978 to 2009) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing the administration‐time‐related effects of evening with morning dosing monotherapy regimens in patients with primary hypertension were included. Patients with known secondary hypertension, shift workers or white coat hypertension were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Data synthesis and analysis were done using RevMan 5.1. Random effects meta‐analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted. 
Main results
21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 1,993 patients with primary hypertension met the inclusion criteria for this review ‐ ACEIs (5 trials), CCBs (7 trials), ARBs (6 trials), diuretics (2 trials), alpha‐blockers (1 trial), and beta‐blockers (1 trial). Meta‐analysis showed significant heterogeneity across trials.
