For preventive NSAIDs, there may be little or no difference in early acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.12; studies = 18; participants = 1140; I2 = 75%; low‐certainty evidence). One study reported adverse events from NSAIDs (reoperation for bleeding) although the events were low which did not allow any meaningful conclusions to be drawn (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.18 to 20.68). There may be little or no difference in rates of short‐term (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30; studies = 1; participants = 76; low‐certainty evidence) or long‐term (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; studies = 5; participants = 456; I2 = 29%; low‐certainty evidence) nausea and vomiting. There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.07; studies = 21; participants = 1441; I2 = 81%; low‐certainty evidence). There is probably a reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐1.93 mg, 95% CI ‐3.55 mg to ‐0.32 mg; studies = 16; participants = 1323; I2 = 49%; moderate‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is any difference in time to analgesic request (MD 8.51 minutes, 95% CI ‐31.24 minutes to 48.27 minutes; studies = 8; participants = 410; I2 = 98%; very low‐certainty evidence). As with pre‐emptive NSAIDs, there may be little or no difference in other opioid adverse events such as pruritus (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.35; studies = 3; participants = 211; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence) and sedation (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.63; studies = 5; participants = 497; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in patient satisfaction (MD ‐0.42; 95% CI ‐1.09 to 0.25; studies = 1; participants = 72; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported on chronic pain. There is probably little or no difference in time to first bowel movement (MD 0.00; 95% CI ‐15.99 to 15.99; studies = 1; participants = 76; moderate‐certainty evidence).
