Background
Alcohol use and misuse in young people is a major risk behaviour for mortality and morbidity. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a popular technique for addressing excessive drinking in young adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of motivational interviewing (MI) interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol‐related problems in young adults. 
Search methods
We identified relevant evidence from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2015), and PsycINFO (1985 to July 2015). We also searched clinical trial registers and handsearched references of topic‐related systematic reviews and the included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in young adults up to the age of 25 years comparing MIs for prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol‐related problems with no intervention, assessment only or alternative interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol‐related problems. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included a total of 84 trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow‐up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short‐term reporting or publication bias. Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence. 
At four or more months follow‐up, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.15 to −0.06 or a reduction from 13.7 drinks/week to 12.5 drinks/week; moderate quality evidence); frequency of alcohol consumption (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.07 or a reduction in the number of days/week alcohol was consumed from 2.74 days to 2.52 days; moderate quality evidence); and peak blood alcohol concentration, or BAC (SMD −0.12, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.05, or a reduction from 0.144% to 0.131%; moderate quality evidence).
