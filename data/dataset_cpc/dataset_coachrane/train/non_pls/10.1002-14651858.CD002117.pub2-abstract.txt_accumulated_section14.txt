Background
Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five year‐olds and 2% of adults. Although spontaneous remission often occurs, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Tricyclics have been used to treat enuresis since the 1960s. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of tricyclic and related drugs compared with other interventions for treating children with enuresis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (containing trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings), on 30 November 2015, and reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing a tricyclic or related drug with another intervention for treating enuresis. We also included combination therapies that included tricyclics. We excluded trials for treating daytime wetting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. We settled differences by discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
Sixty‐four trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 4071 children. The quality of many trials was poor, with comparisons addressed by single studies. Minor adverse effects were common, and reported in 30 trials. These included dizziness, headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal discomforts and neutropenia. More serious side‐effects can occur but were not reported. Seven trials reported no adverse effects. 
Tricyclics are more effective than placebo, particularly for short‐term outcomes. Compared to placebo, imipramine resulted in one fewer wet nights per week (mean difference (MD) ‐0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.40 to ‐0.50; 4 trials, 347 children), with fewer failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights (78% versus 95% for placebo, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 12 trials, 831 children). Amitriptyline and desipramine were more effective than placebo, but nortriptyline and mianserin showed no difference. Most tricyclics did not have a sustained effect after ceasing treatment, with 96% wetting at follow‐up for imipramine versus 97% for placebo. 
Imipramine combined with oxybutynin is also more effective than placebo, with 33% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment versus 78% for placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78; 1 trial, 47 children) and 45% wetting at follow‐up versus 79% for placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99; 1 trial, 36 children).
