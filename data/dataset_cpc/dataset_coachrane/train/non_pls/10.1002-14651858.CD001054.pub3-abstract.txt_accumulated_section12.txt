Background
Visual problems in older people are common and frequently under‐reported. The effects of poor vision in older people are wide reaching and include falls, confusion and reduced quality of life. Much of the visual impairment in older ages can be treated (e.g. cataract surgery, correction of refractive error). Vision screening may therefore reduce the number of older people living with sight loss. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects on vision of community vision screening of older people for visual impairment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 23 November 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared vision screening alone or as part of a multi‐component screening package as compared to no vision screening or standard care, on the vision of people aged 65 years or over in a community setting. We included trials that used self‐reported visual problems or visual acuity testing as the screening tool. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Visual outcome data were available for 10,608 people in 10 trials. Four trials took place in the UK, two in Australia, two in the United States and two in the Netherlands. Length of follow‐up ranged from one to five years. Three of these studies were cluster‐randomised trials whereby general practitioners or family physicians were randomly allocated to undertake vision screening or no vision screening. All studies were funded by government agencies. Overall we judged the studies to be at low risk of bias and only downgraded the certainty of the evidence (GRADE) for imprecision.
