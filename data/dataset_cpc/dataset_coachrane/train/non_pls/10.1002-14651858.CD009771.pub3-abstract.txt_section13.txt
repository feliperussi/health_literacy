When comparing protocol‐directed sedation with usual care, there was no clear evidence of difference in duration of mechanical ventilation in hours for the entire duration of the first ICU stay for each patient (MD ‐28.15 hours, 95% CI ‐69.15 to 12.84; I2 = 85%; 4 studies; adjusted sample 2210 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of difference in ICU mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.50; I2 = 67%; 2 studies; 513 participants; low‐quality evidence), or hospital mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.13; I2 = 10%; 3 studies; adjusted sample 2088 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of difference in ICU length of stay (MD ‐1.70 days, 95% CI‐3.71 to 0.31; I2 = 82%; 4 studies; adjusted sample of 2123 participants; low‐quality of evidence), however there was evidence of a significant reduction in hospital length of stay (MD ‐3.09 days, 95% CI ‐5.08 to ‐1.10; I2 = 2%; 3 studies; adjusted sample of 1922 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of difference in the incidence of self‐extubation (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.42; I2 = 0%; 2 studies; adjusted sample of 1687 participants; high‐quality evidence), or incidence of tracheostomy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.30; I2 = 66%; 3 studies; adjusted sample of 2008 participants; low‐quality evidence). Only one study examined incidence of reintubation, therefore we could not pool data; there was no clear evidence of difference (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24; 1 study; 321 participants; low‐quality evidence).
