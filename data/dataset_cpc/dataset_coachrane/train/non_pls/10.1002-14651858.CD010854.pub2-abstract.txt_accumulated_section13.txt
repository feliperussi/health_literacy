Background
 Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas) are the most common benign pelvic tumours among women. They may be asymptomatic, or may be associated with pelvic symptoms such as bleeding and pain. Medical treatment of this condition is limited and gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are the most effective agents. Long‐term treatment with such agents, however, is restricted due to their adverse effects. The addition of other medications during treatment with GnRH analogues, a strategy known as add‐back therapy, may limit these side effects. There is concern, however, that add‐back therapy may also limit the efficacy of the GnRH analogues and that it may not be able to completely prevent their adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐term (within 12 months) effectiveness and safety of add‐back therapy for women using GnRH analogues for uterine fibroids associated with excessive uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, or urinary symptoms. 
Search methods
We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO; and electronic registries of ongoing trials including ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. All searches were from database inception to 16 June 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included women with uterine fibroids experiencing irregular or intense uterine bleeding, cyclic or non‐cyclic pelvic pain, or urinary symptoms, and that compared treatment with a GnRH analogue plus add‐back therapy versus a GnRH analogue alone or combined with placebo were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed the identified titles and abstracts for potentially eligible records. Two review authors reviewed eligible studies and independently extracted data. Two authors independently assessed the studies' risk of bias. They assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
Fourteen RCTs were included in the review. Data were extracted from 12 studies (622 women). The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL). 
Add‐back therapy with medroxyprogesterone (MPA): no studies reported QoL or uterine bleeding. There was no evidence of effect in relation to bone mass (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.62 to 1.38, 1 study, 16 women, P = 0.45, low quality evidence) and MPA was associated with a larger uterine volume (mean difference (MD) 342.19 cm3, 95% CI 77.58 to 606.80, 2 studies, 32 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence).
