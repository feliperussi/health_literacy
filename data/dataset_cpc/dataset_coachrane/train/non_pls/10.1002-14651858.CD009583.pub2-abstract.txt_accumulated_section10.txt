Background
Several surveys over the past few years have demonstrated that postoperative pain in children is not treated appropriately. One pharmacological treatment option in a multimodal approach for postoperative pain treatment is the systemic administration of opioids. However, opioids are rarely used for postoperative pain treatment in children due to fear of adverse events. One long‐standing opioid for systemic use is nalbuphine, a kappa‐receptor agonist and µ‐receptor antagonist. The efficacy of nalbuphine is believed to be similar to morphine. Increased dosing might result in a ceiling effect, and thus less analgesia than expected. In addition, there might be a lower risk for opioid‐induced side effects (nausea, vomiting) and severe adverse events (respiratory depression) due to the antagonistic effect of the µ‐receptor. Nalbuphine may be an useful opioid for postoperative use in children, but exact efficacy (e.g. compared to other commonly used opioids) has not been determined yet. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and adverse events of nalbuphine for acute postoperative pain treatment in children undergoing surgery. 
Search methods
We systematically searched the following databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Pubmed (January 1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE via Ovid (January 1947 to July 2013). We did not impose any restrictions regarding language or publication date. We checked all reference lists of retrieved articles for additional references. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating nalbuphine compared with placebo or other opioids were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently scanned the retrieved articles and made a decision regarding inclusion or exclusion of studies for this review. The same authors also performed the data extraction and the assessment of risk of bias.
