We found no evidence for an effect of dance/movement therapy on depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to 0.32, P = 0.89, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), stress (SMD = ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.12, P = 0.24, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), anxiety (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.51 P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 170), fatigue (SMD = ‐0.36, 95% ‐1.26 to 0.55, P = 0.44, I² = 80%) (two studies, N = 170) and body image (SMD = ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.34, P = 0.58, I2 = 0%) (two studies, N = 68) in women with breast cancer. The data of one study with moderate risk of bias suggested that dance/movement therapy had a large beneficial effect on 37 participants' quality of life (QoL) (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.57). One study with a high risk of bias reported greater improvements in vigor and greater reduction in somatization in the dance/movement therapy group compared to a standard care control group (N = 31). The individual studies did not find support for an effect of dance/movement therapy on mood, mental health, and pain. It is unclear whether this was due to ineffectiveness of the treatment, inappropriate outcome measures or limited power of the trials. Finally, the results of one study did not find evidence for an effect of dance/movement therapy on shoulder range of motion (ROM) or arm circumference in 37 women who underwent a lumpectomy or breast surgery. However, this was likely due to large within‐group variability for shoulder ROM and a limited number of participants with lymphedema.
