Background
Cerebral toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis (hereafter referred to as TE) was one of the first opportunistic infections to be described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ‐infected patients. Treatment of TE has been relatively successful in comparison to other opportunistic infections. Prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a median survival of over a year was reported for patients who could tolerate the toxicity of TE treatment. HAART is becoming increasingly widely available in sub‐Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV‐infected patients live. Many patients in Africa are diagnosed with HIV only after developing opportunistic infections such as TE. Hence, the optimal management of opportunistic infections such as TE is important if the benefits of subsequently initiating HAART are to be seen. 
Objectives
The purpose of this review is to determine the most effective therapy for TE in HIV‐infected adults. Different treatment regimens have been compared with regard to clinical and radiological response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse events. 
Search methods
A comprehensive search of relevant databases and other sources was conducted to identify relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised double‐blinded trials were included.
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted using standardised forms and analysed using Rev Man 4.2.7 software.
Main results
Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Dannemann et al 1992 and Katlama et al 1996 compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). Torre 1998 compared P+S with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX). For the purposes of this review, clinical outcomes were analysed as complete or partial resolution vs. failure. Patients who crossed over or were lost to follow‐up were analysed as failures.
