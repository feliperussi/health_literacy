Background
Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity, affecting around 9% of births in high‐income countries and an estimated 13% of births in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Tocolytics are drugs used to suppress uterine contractions for women in preterm labour. The most widely used tocolytic are the betamimetics, however, these are associated with a high frequency of unpleasant and sometimes severe maternal side effects. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (such as nifedipine) may have similar tocolytic efficacy with less side effects than betamimetics. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) (e.g. atosiban) also have a low side‐effect profile. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of CCBs, administered as a tocolytic agent, to women in preterm labour. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (12 November 2013). 
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomised trials in which CCBs were used for tocolysis for women in labour between 20 and 36 completed weeks' gestation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, undertook quality assessment and data extraction. Results are presented using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) were calculated for categorical outcomes that were statistically significantly different. 
Main results
This update includes 26 additional trials involving 2511 women, giving a total of 38 included trials (3550 women). Thirty‐five trials used nifedipine as the CCB and three trials used nicardipine. Blinding of intervention and outcome assessment was undertaken in only one of the trials (a placebo controlled trial). However, objective outcomes defined according to timing of birth and perinatal mortality were considered to have low risk of detection bias. 
Two small trials comparing CCBs with placebo or no treatment showed a significant reduction in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43) and an increase in maternal adverse effects (RR 49.89, 95% CI 3.13 to 795.02, one trial of 89 women). Due to substantial heterogeneity, outcome data for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) were not combined; one placebo controlled trial showed no difference (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) while the other (non‐placebo controlled trial) reported a reduction (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62). No other outcomes were reported. 
Comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with other tocolytics by type (including betamimetics, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch, non‐steriodal anti inflammatories (NSAID), magnesium sulphate and ORAs), no significant reductions were shown in primary outcome measures of birth within 48 hours of treatment or perinatal mortality. 
Comparing CCBs with betamimetics, there were fewer maternal adverse effects (average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.53) and fewer maternal adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy (average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.48). Calcium channel blockers resulted in an increase in the interval between trial entry and birth (average MD 4.38 days, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.52) and gestational age (MD 0.71 weeks, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.09), while decreasing preterm and very preterm birth (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98 and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93); respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86); necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96); intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84); neonatal jaundice (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92); and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87). No difference was shown in one trial of outcomes at nine to twelve years of age.
