Background
Pain after caesarean sections (CS) can affect the well‐being of the mother and her ability with her newborn. Conventional pain‐relieving strategies are often underused because of concerns about the adverse maternal and neonatal effects. Complementary alternative therapies (CAM) may offer an alternative for post‐CS pain. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of CAM for post‐caesarean pain.
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, LILACS, PEDro, CAMbase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (6 September 2019), and checked the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs, comparing CAM, alone or associated with other forms of pain relief, versus other treatments or placebo or no treatment, for the treatment of post‐CS pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 37 studies (3076 women) which investigated eight different CAM therapies for post‐CS pain relief. There is substantial heterogeneity among the trials. We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to small numbers of women participating in the trials and to risk of bias related to lack of blinding and inadequate reporting of randomisation processes. None of the trials reported pain at six weeks after discharge. 
Primary outcomes were pain and adverse effects, reported per intervention below. Secondary outcomes included vital signs, rescue analgesic requirement at six weeks after discharge; all of which were poorly reported, not reported, or we are uncertain as to the effect
