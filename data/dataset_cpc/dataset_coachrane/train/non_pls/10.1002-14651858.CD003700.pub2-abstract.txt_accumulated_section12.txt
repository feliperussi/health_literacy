Background
Acute respiratory infections, mostly in the form of pneumonia, are the leading causes of death in children under five years of age in low‐income countries. Some clinical trials have demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation reduces the severity of respiratory infections and mortality in children with measles. 
Objectives
To determine whether adjunctive vitamin A is effective in children diagnosed with non‐measles pneumonia. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Regsiter, MEDLINE (1996 to July week 3, 2010), EMBASE (1990 to August 2010), LILACS (1985 to August 2010), CINAHL (1990 to August 2010), Biological Abstracts (1990 to August 2010), Current Contents (1990 to August 2010) and the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM) (1994 to June 2010). 
Selection criteria
Only parallel‐arm, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, in which children (younger than 15 years of age) with non‐measles pneumonia were treated with adjunctive vitamin A, were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information. 
Main results
Six trials involving 1740 children were included. There was no significant reduction in mortality associated with pneumonia in children treated with vitamin A compared to those who were not (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 2.66). Also, there was no statistically significant difference in duration of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) 0.08; 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.59). Disease severity after supplementary high‐dose vitamin A was significantly worse compared with placebo. However, low‐dose vitamin A significantly reduced the recurrence rate of bronchopneumonia (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.46). Moderate vitamin A significantly reduced the time to remission of signs in children with normal serum retinol (> 200 ug/L).
