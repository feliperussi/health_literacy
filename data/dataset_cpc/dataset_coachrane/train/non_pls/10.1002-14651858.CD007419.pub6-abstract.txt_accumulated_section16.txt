Background
Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a common complication of diabetic retinopathy. Antiangiogenic therapy with anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) can reduce oedema, improve vision and prevent further visual loss. These drugs have replaced laser photocoagulation as the standard of care for people with DMO. 
Objectives
The 2014 update of this review found high‐quality evidence of benefit with anti‐VEGF modalities, compared to laser photocoagulation, for the treatment of DMO. The objective of this updated review is to compare the effectiveness and safety of the different anti‐VEGF drugs using network meta‐analysis methods. 
Search methods
We searched various electronic databases on 26 April 2017.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any anti‐angiogenic drug with an anti‐VEGF mechanism of action versus another anti‐VEGF drug, another treatment, sham or no treatment in people with DMO. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods for pair‐wise meta‐analysis and we augmented this evidence using network meta‐analysis methods. We focused on the relative efficacy and safety of the three most commonly used drugs as interventions of direct interest for practice: aflibercept and ranibizumab, used on‐label; and off‐label bevacizumab. 
We collected data on three efficacy outcomes (gain of 15 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters; mean change in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA); mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT)), three safety outcomes (all severe systemic adverse events (SSAEs); all‐cause death; arterial thromboembolic events) and quality of life. 
We used Stata 'network' meta‐analysis package for all analyses. We investigated the risk of bias of mixed comparisons based on the variance contribution of each study, having assigned an overall risk of bias to each study. 
Main results
Twenty‐four studies included 6007 participants with DMO and moderate vision loss, of which two studies randomised 265 eyes of 230 participants and one was a cross‐over study on 56 participants (62 eyes) that was treated as a parallel‐arm trial. Data were collected on drugs of direct interest from three studies on aflibercept (975 eyes), eight studies on bevacizumab (515 eyes), and 14 studies on ranibizumab (1518 eyes). As treatments of indirect interest or legacy treatment we included three studies on pegaptanib (541 eyes), five studies on ranibizumab plus prompt laser (557 eyes), one study on ranibizumab plus deferred laser (188 eyes), 13 studies on laser photocoagulation (936 eyes) and six studies on sham treatment (793 eyes). 
Aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab were all more effective than laser for improving vision by 3 or more lines after one year (high‐certainty evidence). Approximately one in 10 people improve vision with laser, and about three in 10 people improve with anti‐VEGF treatment: risk ratio (RR) versus laser 3.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79 to 4.79) for aflibercept; RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.81 to 3.37) for bevacizumab; RR 2.76 (95% CI 2.12 to 3.59) for ranibizumab. On average there was no change in visual acuity (VA) with laser after one year, compared with a gain of 1 or 2 lines with anti‐VEGF treatment: laser versus aflibercept mean difference (MD) −0.20 (95% CI −0.22 to −0.17) logMAR; versus bevacizumab MD −0.12 (95% CI −0.15 to −0.09) logMAR; versus ranibizumab MD −0.12 (95% CI −0.14 to −0.10) logMAR. The certainty of the evidence was high for the comparison of aflibercept and ranibizumab with laser and moderate for bevacizumab comparison with laser due to inconsistency between the indirect and direct evidence. 
People receiving ranibizumab were less likely to gain 3 or more lines of VA at one year compared with aflibercept: RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.94), moderate‐certainty evidence. For every 1000 people treated with aflibercept, 92 fewer would gain 3 or more lines of VA at one year if treated with ranibizumab (22 to 148 fewer). On average people receiving ranibizumab had worse VA at one year (MD 0.08 logMAR units, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11), moderate‐certainty evidence; and higher CRT (MD 39 µm, 95% CI 2 µm to 76 µm; low‐certainty evidence). Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were comparable with respect to aflibercept and did not differ in terms of VA: RR of gain of 3 or more lines of VA at one year 1.11 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43), moderate‐certainty evidence, and difference in change in VA was 0.00 (95% CI −0.02 to 0.03) logMAR, moderate‐certainty evidence. CRT reduction favoured ranibizumab by −29 µm (95% CI −58 µm to −1 µm, low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of overall statistical inconsistency in our analyses.
