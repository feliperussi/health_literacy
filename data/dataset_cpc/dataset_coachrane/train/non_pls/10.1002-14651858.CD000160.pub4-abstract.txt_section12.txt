We included 11 trials involving 2100 participants undergoing 2304 CEA operations. The quality of trials was generally poor. Follow‐up varied from hospital discharge to five years. Compared with primary closure, carotid patch angioplasty may make little or no difference to reduction in risk of any stroke during the perioperative period (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.03; P = 0.063; 8 studies, 1769 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but may lower the risk of any stroke during long‐term follow‐up (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.90; P = 0.022; 7 studies, 1332 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In the included studies, carotid patch angioplasty resulted in a lower risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative period (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 7 studies, 1201 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and during long‐term follow‐up (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1141 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the risk of any stroke or death during long‐term follow‐up (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; P = 0.003; 6 studies, 1019 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the included studies suggest that carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; P < 0.0001; 7 studies, 1435 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and may reduce the risk of restenosis during long‐term follow‐up (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 1719 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The studies recorded very few arterial complications, including haemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies and pseudo‐aneurysm formation, with either patch or primary closure. We found no correlation between the use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long‐term stroke‐related death or all‐cause death rates.
