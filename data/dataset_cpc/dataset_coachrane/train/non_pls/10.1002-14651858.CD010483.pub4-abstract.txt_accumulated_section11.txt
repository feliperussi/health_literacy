Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2015, Issue 10. 
Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, refractory form of epilepsy, for which stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed as add‐on therapy. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments (including ketogenic diet) for patients with SMEI. 
Search methods
For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (20 December 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 20 December 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 December 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (20 December 2016). Previously we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP, but this was not usable at the time of this update. We also searched the bibliographies of identified studies for additional references. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings and imposed no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐randomised controlled trials; double‐ or single‐blinded or unblinded trials; and parallel‐group studies. Administration of at least one antiepileptic drug therapy given singly (monotherapy) or in combination (add‐on therapy) compared with add‐on placebo or no add‐on treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to predefined criteria, extracted relevant data and evaluated the methodological quality of trials. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater seizure reduction, seizure freedom, adverse effects, proportion of dropouts and quality of life. We assessed outcomes by using a Mantel‐Haenszel meta‐analysis to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
