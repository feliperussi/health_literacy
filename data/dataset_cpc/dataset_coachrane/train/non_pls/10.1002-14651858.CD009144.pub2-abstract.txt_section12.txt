Six trials were included. Three trials with 106 participants, of which two trials with high risk of bias, did not demonstrate significant effects of bisphosphonates (etidronate or alendronate) versus placebo or no intervention regarding mortality (RD 0.00; 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.12, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.66, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04). Two trials with 62 participants with high risk of bias compared one bisphosphonate (etidronate or alendronate) versus another (alendronate or ibandronate) and found no significant difference regarding mortality (RD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.07, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.18 to 5.06, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04, I² = 0%). Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on liver‐related mortality, liver transplantation, or liver‐related morbidity compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no intervention seem to decrease the urinary amino telopeptides of collagen I (NTx) concentration (MD ‐16.93 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine; 95% CI ‐23.77 to ‐10.10; 2 trials with 88 patients; I² = 0%) and serum osteocalcin (SMD ‐0.81; 95% CI ‐1.22 to ‐0.39; 3 trials with 100 patients; I² = 34 %) concentration. The former result was supported by trial sequential analysis, but not the latter. Alendronate compared with another bisphosphonate (ibandronate) had no significant effect on serum osteocalcin concentration (MD ‐3.61 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐9.41 to 2.18; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%) in a random‐effects meta‐analysis, but it significantly decreased serum osteocalcin (MD ‐4.40 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐6.75 to ‐2.05; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%), the procollagen type I N‐terminal propeptide (MD ‐8.79 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐15.96 to ‐1.63; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 38%), and NTx concentration (MD ‐14.07 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine, 95% CI ‐24.23 to ‐3.90; 2 trials with 46 patients; I²=0%) in a fixed‐effect model. The latter two results were not supported by trial sequential analyses. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients having bisphosphonates withdrawn due to adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention (RD ‐0.04; 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.12; 2 trials with 46 patients; I² = 0%), or another bisphosphonate (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.17; 2 trials with 62 patients; I² = 0%). One trial with 32 participants and with high risk of bias compared etidronate versus sodium fluoride without finding significant difference regarding mortality, fractures, adverse events, or bone mineral density. Etidronate compared with sodium fluoride significantly decreased serum osteocalcin, urinary hydroxyproline, and parathyroid hormone concentration.
