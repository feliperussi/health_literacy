Six randomized controlled trials of synthetic surfactant treatment of established respiratory distress syndrome were identified. Five of the studies used Exosurf Neonatal (a synthetic surfactant composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, hexadecanol and tyloxapol); one small study utilized a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Treatment with intratracheal Exosurf Neonatal in premature infants with established respiratory distress syndrome improves pulmonary gas exchange and decreases the requirement for ventilatory support. In individual trials, the use of Exosurf Neonatal resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pneumothorax, patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), BPD or death at 28 days, and mortality. Similar results are seen when these large trials of Exosurf Neonatal are analyzed in conjunction with the smaller trial of dry powdered DPPC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The meta‐analysis supports a decrease in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.64, 95% CI 0.55, 0.76, typical risk difference ‐0.09, 95% CI ‐0.12,‐0.06), a decrease in the risk of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (typical relative risk 0.62, 95% CI 0.54, 0.71, typical risk difference ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.16, ‐0.09), a decrease in the risk of patent ductus arteriosus (typical relative risk 0.90, 95% CI 0.84, 0.97; typical risk difference ‐0.06 95% CI ‐0.10, ‐0.02), a decrease in the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (typical relative risk 0.88, 95% CI 0.77, 0.99; typical risk difference ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.08, ‐0.00), a decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (typical relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.61, 0.92; typical risk difference ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.06, ‐0.01), a decrease in the risk of neonatal mortality (typical relative risk 0.73, 95% CI 0.61, 0.88; typical risk difference ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07, ‐0.02), a decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at 28 days (typical relative risk 0.73, 95% CI 0.65, 0.83; typical risk difference ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.11, ‐0.05), a decrease in the risk of mortality prior to hospital discharge (typical relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.68, 0.92; typical risk difference ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07, ‐0.02) and a decrease in the risk of mortality during the first year of life (typical relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.69, 0.94; typical risk difference ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.07, ‐0.01). Treatment with synthetic surfactant increases the risk of apnea of prematurity (typical relative risk 1.20, 95% CI 1.09, 1.31; typical risk difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.04, 0.12).
