Comparing endovascular revascularisation plus supervised exercise versus supervised exercise alone showed no clear differences between groups for MWD (SMD 0.26, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.64; 3 studies; 432 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and PFWD (SMD 0.33, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.93; 2 studies; 305 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Long‐term follow‐up in one study (106 participants) revealed a large effect on MWD (SMD 1.18, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.70; low‐quality evidence) in favour of the combination therapy. Reports indicate that disease‐specific QoL was comparable between groups (SMD 0.25, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.56; 2 studies; 330 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and that the number of secondary invasive interventions (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.55; 3 studies; 457 participants; high‐quality evidence) was lower following combination therapy.  Two studies comparing endovascular revascularisation plus pharmacotherapy (cilostazol) versus pharmacotherapy alone provided data showing a small effect on MWD (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.68; 186 participants; high‐quality evidence), a moderate effect on PFWD (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94; 186 participants; high‐quality evidence), and a moderate effect on disease‐specific QoL (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.91; 170 participants; high‐quality evidence) in favour of combination therapy. Long‐term follow‐up in one study (47 participants) revealed a moderate effect on MWD (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.36; P = 0.02) in favour of combination therapy and no clear differences in PFWD between groups (SMD 0.54, 95% CI ‐0.08 to 1.17; P = 0.09). The number of secondary invasive interventions was comparable between groups (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 6.83; 199 participants; high‐quality evidence).
