Background
Toremifene (TOR) and tamoxifen (TAM) can both be used as treatments for advanced breast cancer. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of TOR with TAM in patients with advanced breast cancer. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register was searched (1 July 2011) using the codes for "toremifene", "fareston", "tamoxifen, "nolvadex, and "breast cancer". We also searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) (from inception to 1 July 2011), EMBASE (via Ovid) (from inception to 1 July 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2011), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (1 July 2011). In addition, we screened the reference lists of relevant trials or reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy and safety, or both of TOR with TAM in women with advanced breast cancer. Trials that provided sufficient data on one of the following items: objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and adverse events, were considered eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality. Two review authors independently extracted the following details: first author, publication year, country, years of follow‐up, treatment arms, intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population size, menopausal status of patients, hormone receptor status, response criteria, efficacy and safety outcomes of TOR and TAM arms. Hazard ratios (HR) were derived for time‐to‐event outcomes, where possible, and response and adverse events were analysed as dichotomous variables. We used a fixed‐effect model for meta‐analysis unless there was significant between‐study heterogeneity.
