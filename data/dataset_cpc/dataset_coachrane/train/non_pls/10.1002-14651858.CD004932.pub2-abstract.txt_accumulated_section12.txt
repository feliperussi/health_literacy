Background
Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that causes diarrhoea lasting about one to two weeks, sometimes extending up to 2.5 months among the immunocompentent and becoming a more severe life‐threatening illness among immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium is a common cause of gastroenteritis. Cryptosporidiosis is common in HIV‐infected individuals. 
Objectives
The objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of interventions for the treatment and prevention of cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised individuals. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to August 2005: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, AIDSearch, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, Geobase, and the Environmental Sciences and Pollution Management. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared the use of any intervention to treat or prevent cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised persons were included. The outcome measures for treatment studies included symptomatic diarrhoea and oocyst clearance. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for quality of randomisation, blinding, withdrawals, and adequacy of allocation concealment. The relative risk for each intervention was calculated using a random effects model. 
Main results
Seven trials involving 169 participants were included. There were 130 adults with AIDS enrolled in five studies. Evidence of significant heterogeneity was present. There was no evidence for a reduction in the duration or frequency of diarrhoea by nitazoxanide (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.36‐1.94)) and paramomycin (RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.42‐1.31)) compared with placebo. Nitazoxanide led to a significant evidence of oocyst clearance compared with placebo among all children with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.30‐0.91). The effect was not significant for HIV‐seropositive participants (RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.36‐1.37)). HIV‐seronegative participants on nitazoxanide had a significantly higher relative risk of achieving parasitological clearance of 0.26 (95% CI 0.09‐0.80) based on a single study. The single study comparing spiramycin with placebo found no significant difference in reduction of the duration of hospitalisation (mean difference ‐0.40 days (95% CI ‐6.62‐5.82)) or in mortality between the two arms of the trial (RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.04‐4.35)). One study assessed the role of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract, reporting a relative risk for decreased stool frequency of 0.19 (95% CI 0.03‐1.19), while another compared bovine hyperimmune colostrum with placebo and found no evidence for improvement of stool volume (RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.61‐14.86)) or in oocyst concentration per ml of stool (RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.02‐3.74)). No studies were found that assessed prevention.
