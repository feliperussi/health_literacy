Twelve trials reporting on nine treatment comparisons (2317 patients randomised) were identified. The majority of trials (10 trials) had an unclear or high risk of bias. Time‐to‐event data were collected for nine trials for overall survival and eight trials for progression‐free survival. All 12 trials reported results for tumour response. In the 12 trials there were 1023 deaths in 2317 women randomised. There was no difference in overall survival, with an overall HR of 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.16; P = 0.45), and no significant heterogeneity. This result was consistent in the four subgroups analysed (risk of bias, line of chemotherapy, type of schema of chemotherapy, and relative dose intensity). In particular, there was no difference in survival according to the type of schema of chemotherapy, that is whether chemotherapy was given on disease progression or after a set number of cycles. In the seven trials that reported progression‐free survival (time to first progression in the sequential arm), 637 women progressed out of the 846 women randomised. There was weak evidence of a higher risk of progression in the combination arm (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.25; P = 0.08) with no significant heterogeneity. This result was consistent in all subgroups. Overall tumour response rates were higher in the combination arm (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28; P = 0.001) but there was significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. In the seven trials that reported treatment‐related deaths, there was no significant difference between the two arms, although the CIs were very wide due to the small number of events (RR 1.53; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.29; P = 0.28). The risk of febrile neutropenia was higher in the combination arm (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; P = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of neutropenia, nausea and vomiting, or treatment‐related deaths. Overall quality of life showed no difference between the two groups, but only three trials reported this outcome.
