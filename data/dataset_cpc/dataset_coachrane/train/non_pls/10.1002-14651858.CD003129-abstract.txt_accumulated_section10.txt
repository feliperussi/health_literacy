Background
In both adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile arthritis, the focus has shifted from 'inflammation parameters' to more patient centered disability outcomes. In RA this resulted in the development of the Outcome Measures in Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT), and in juvenile arthritis the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) core set. This PRINTO‐core set was established using a combination of statistical and consensus formation techniques. This core set contains a number of patient centered disability measures. This review systematically searched the available literature and reports the available evidence of efficacy of MTX, with special focus on patient centered disability measures in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). 
Objectives
To perform a systematic review on the effects of MTX on functional ability, range of motion, quality of life, overall well‐being and pain for patients with JIA. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) and MEDLINE were searched up to March 2001, using the search strategy sensitive for randomised controlled trials, used by the Cochrane Collaboration. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing MTX against placebo or standard care in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) were selected. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TT, JN) determined the studies to be included in this review and extracted the data of patient centered disability measures. The data were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMD) for limited joint range score, number of joints with swelling. The number of joints with pain on motion were evaluated using weighted mean differences (WMD). Physicians global assessment, parents global assessment and withdrawals due to efficacy and side effects were evaluated with pooled odds ratios (OR).
