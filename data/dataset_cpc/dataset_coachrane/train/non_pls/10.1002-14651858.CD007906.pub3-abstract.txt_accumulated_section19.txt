Background
Intensive Case Management (ICM) is a community‐based package of care aiming to provide long‐term care for severely mentally ill people who do not require immediate admission. Intensive Case Management evolved from two original community models of care, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Case Management (CM), where ICM emphasises the importance of small caseload (fewer than 20) and high‐intensity input. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of ICM as a means of caring for severely mentally ill people in the community in comparison with non‐ICM (caseload greater than 20) and with standard community care. We did not distinguish between models of ICM. In addition, to assess whether the effect of ICM on hospitalisation (mean number of days per month in hospital) is influenced by the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and by the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted (baseline level of hospital use). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last update search 10 April 2015). 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, aged 18 to 65 years and treated in the community care setting, where ICM is compared to non‐ICM or standard care. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. 
We performed a random‐effects meta‐regression analysis to examine the association of the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted with the treatment effect. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach and investigated possible risk of bias within included trials. 
Main results
The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non‐ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 
1. ICM versus standard care
When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34,low‐quality evidence). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79, low‐quality evidence). For the outcome adverse events, the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low‐quality evidence). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low‐quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0, very low‐quality evidence). 
2. ICM versus non‐ICM
When ICM was compared with non‐ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate‐quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.21, moderate‐quality evidence) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.05, moderate‐quality evidence) compared to non‐ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95,low‐quality evidence) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84, low‐quality evidence). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non‐ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74, very low‐quality evidence). 
3. Fidelity to ACT
Within the meta‐regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.07, P = 0.0027).
