Background
Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five‐year‐olds and can have considerable social, emotional and psychological effects. Treatments include alarms (activated by urination), behavioural interventions and drugs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of enuresis alarms for treating enuresis in children.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 25 June 2018), and reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised trials of enuresis alarms or alarms combined with another intervention for treating nocturnal enuresis in children between 5 and 16 years old. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
Main results
We included 74 trials (5983 children).
At treatment completion, alarms may reduce the number of wet nights a week compared to control or no treatment (mean difference (MD) −2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.59 to −0.78; 4 trials, 127 children; low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence suggests more children may achieve complete response (14 consecutive dry nights) with alarms compared to control or no treatment (RR 7.23, 95% CI 1.40 to 37.33; 18 trials, 827 children) and that more children may remain dry post‐treatment (RR 9.67, 95% CI 4.74 to 19.76; 10 trials, 366 children; low‐quality evidence). 
At treatment completion, we are uncertain whether there is any difference between alarms and placebo drugs in the number of wet nights a week (MD −0.96, 95% CI −2.32 to 0.41; 1 trial, 47 children; very low‐quality evidence). Alarms may result in more children achieving complete response than with placebo drugs (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.17; 2 trials, 181 children; low‐quality evidence). No trials comparing alarms to placebo reported the number of children remaining dry post‐treatment. 
Compared with control alarms, code‐word alarms probably slightly increase the number of children achieving complete response at treatment completion (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27; 1 trial, 353 children; moderate‐quality evidence) but there is probably little to no difference in the number of children remaining dry post‐treatment (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; moderate‐quality evidence). Very low‐quality evidence means we are uncertain if there are any differences in effectiveness between the other different types of alarm.
