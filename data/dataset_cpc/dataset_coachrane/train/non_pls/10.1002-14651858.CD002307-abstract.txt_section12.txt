Twenty‐four trials (518 participants) conducted in 13 countries between 1976 and 1998 were included. All drugs were effective at attenuating the exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction response but to varying degrees even within the same individual. Compared to anti‐cholinergic agents, mast cell stabilisers were somewhat more effective at attenuating bronchoconstriction. On average the maximum fall on MCS was reduced to 7.1% compared to 13.8% on AC ( WMD = 6.7%; 95% CI: 3.3 to 10.0), provided more individuals with complete protection (73% vs 56%; OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7) and clinical protection (73% vs 52%; OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.4). There were no subgroup differences based on age, severity, or study quality, and no adverse effects were reported for either agent group. When compared to short acting beta‐agonists mast cell stabilisers were not as effective at preventing deterioration. On average the maximum fall on MCS was 11.2% compared to 4.3% on beta agonists ( WMD = 6.8%; 95% CI: 4.5 to 9.2). MCS provided fewer individuals with complete protection (66% vs 85%; OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5) or clinical protection (55% vs 77%; OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8). There were no significant subgroup differences based on age, severity, drug, delivery, or study quality. A non‐significant difference in side effects was demonstrated with 11% of short acting beta‐agonist patients experiencing side effects compared to 3% of those receiving mast cell stabilisers (OR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0 to 8.2). Combining mast cell stabilisers with a short acting beta‐agonist did not produce significant advantages to pulmonary function over short acting beta‐agonists alone. On average the maximum fall on SABA only was reduced to 5.3% compared to 3.5% on the combination ( WMD = 1.8%; 95% CI: ‐1.1 to 4.6). Beta‐agonists alone provided fewer individuals with complete protection (68% vs 80%; OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2 to 1.4) or clinical protection (70% vs 86%; OR=0.4; 95% CI: 0.1 to 1.2) but the difference did not reach significance (p=0.17). There were no subgroup differences.
