Background
The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti‐inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID‐19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention‐to‐treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co‐infections of individuals with COVID‐19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti‐viral treatments for COVID‐19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID‐19 outpatients and inpatients.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in‐ or outpatient settings. 
Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias. 
Main results
We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID‐19 and four investigated mild COVID‐19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open‐label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. 
Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies.
