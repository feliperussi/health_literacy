Background
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement is a standard treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). In‐stent restenosis after PCI remains an important clinical problem. Xiongshao capsule has been reported to be beneficial in preventing restenosis after PCI in CHD patients. However, the strength of evidence to support its use is unclear. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Xiongshao capsule in preventing restenosis after PCI in patients with CHD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 2012), MEDLINE (OVID) (1948 to week 1 March 2012), EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to week 10 2012), ISI Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1970 to 14 March 2012), LILACS (1982 to 15 March 2012), Chinese biomedical literature database (1980 to May 2012), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994 to May 2012), Chinese Medical Current Contents (1994 to May 2012), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (1989 to May 2012), Chinese Master's Theses Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012), China Doctor Dissertation Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012), and China Proceedings of Conference Full‐Text Database (1994 to May 2012). We also searched ongoing trials and research registries. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing Xiongshao capsule alone/plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine alone/plus placebo in participants with CHD who met the recognised diagnostic criteria and had successfully undergone a PCI procedure were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials using The Cochrane Collaboration tool, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. Data were pooled for meta‐analysis using the fixed‐effect model, and the results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
