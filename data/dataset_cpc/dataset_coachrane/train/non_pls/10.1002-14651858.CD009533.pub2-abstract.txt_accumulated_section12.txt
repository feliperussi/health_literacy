Background
Psychosis is an illness characterised by alterations in thoughts and perceptions resulting in delusions and hallucinations. Psychosis is rare in adolescents but can have serious consequences. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay treatment, and have been shown to be effective. However, there is emerging evidence on psychological interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy, psycho‐education, family therapy and group psychotherapy that may be useful for adolescents with psychosis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of various psychological interventions for adolescents with psychosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based Register of Trials including clinical trials registries (latest, 8 March 2019). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing various psychological interventions with treatment‐as‐usual or other psychological treatments for adolescents with psychosis. For analyses, we included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently and reliably screened studies and we assessed risk of bias of the included studies. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we used mean differences (MDs) and the 95% CIs. We used a random‐effects model for analyses. We created a ‘Summary of findings' table using GRADE. 
Main results
The current review includes 7 studies (n = 319) assessing a heterogenous group of psychological interventions with variable risk of bias. Adverse events were not reported by any of the studies. None of the studies was sponsored by industry. Below, we summarise the main results from four of six comparisons, and the certainty of these results (based on GRADE). All scale scores are average endpoint scores.
