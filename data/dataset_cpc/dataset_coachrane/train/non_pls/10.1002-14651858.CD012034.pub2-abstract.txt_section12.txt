This review includes just one cluster‐randomised study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France. The study did not measure any of our primary or secondary outcomes but did measure behavioural change using three measurement scales: the Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; 29‐item scale), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; 12‐item scale), and the Observation Scale (OS; 25‐item scale). For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a seven‐point scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7‐point scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Non‐Aggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Non‐Aggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items). Four of the five CMAI scales improved in the intervention group (Global: change mean difference (MD) −5.69 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.59 to −1.79; Physically Non‐Aggressive: change MD −0.32 points, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.15; Verbally Non‐Aggressive: change MD −0.44 points, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.19; and Verbally Aggressive: change MD −0.16 points, 95% CI −0.31 to −0.01). There was no difference in change scores on the Physically Aggressive scale (MD −0.08 points, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.21). Using GRADE guidelines, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness of the outcome measures. There were no differences in NPI or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study.
