Background
Plasmodium vivax infections are an important contributor to the malaria burden worldwide. The World Health Organization recommends a 14‐day course of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg/day, giving an adult dose of 15 mg/day) to eradicate the liver stage of the parasite and prevent relapse of the disease. Many people find a 14‐day primaquine regimen difficult to complete, and there is a potential risk of haemolytic anaemia in people with glucose‐6‐phosphate‐dehydrogenase enzyme (G6PD) deficiency. This review evaluates primaquine in P. vivax, particularly alternatives to the standard 14‐day course. 
Objectives
To compare alternative primaquine regimens to the recommended 14‐day regimen for preventing relapses (radical cure) in people with P. vivax malaria treated for blood stage infection with chloroquine. We also summarize trials comparing primaquine to no primaquine that led to the recommendation for the 14‐day regimen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to 8 October 2013. We checked conference proceedings, trial registries and reference lists and contacted researchers and pharmaceutical companies for eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing various primaquine dosing regimens with the standard primaquine regimen (15 mg/day for 14 days), or with no primaquine, in people with vivax malaria treated for blood stage infection with chloroquine. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently assessed trial eligibility, trial quality, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random‐effects model in meta‐analyses if there was significant heterogeneity. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
