Sixteen trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias. Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention). Glucocorticosteroids were administered orally or parenterally for a median 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks). The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of alcoholic liver disease, and 65% were men. Follow‐up, when reported, was up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, until they died (median of 63 days), or for at least one year. There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids on all‐cause mortality up to three months following randomisation (random‐effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low‐certainty evidence) or on health‐related quality of life up to three months, measured with the European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions – 3 Levels scale (MD –0.04 points, 95% CI –0.11 to 0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment (random‐effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low‐certainty evidence), liver‐related mortality up to three months following randomisation (random‐effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low‐certainty evidence), number of participants with any complications up to three months following randomisation (random‐effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; very low‐certainty evidence), and number of participants of non‐serious adverse events up to three months' follow‐up after end of treatment (random‐effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; very low‐certainty evidence). Based on the information that we collected from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be industry‐funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they were partly or completely funded by the industry.
