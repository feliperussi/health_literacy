We included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence).
