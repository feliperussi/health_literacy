We included 17 completed randomised clinical trials, but only 16 studies with 1347 participants provided data for the meta‐analyses. Ten of the 16 trials assessed complete postoperative glucocorticosteroid avoidance (excluding intra‐operative use or treatment of acute rejection) versus short‐term glucocorticosteroids (782 participants) and six trials assessed short‐term glucocorticosteroids versus long‐term glucocorticosteroids (565 participants). One additional study assessed complete post‐operative glucocorticosteroid avoidance but could only be incorporated into qualitative analysis of the results due to limited data published in an abstract. All trials were at high risk of bias. Only eight trials reported on the type of donor used. Overall, we found no statistically significant difference for mortality (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; low‐quality evidence), graft loss including death (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46; low‐quality evidence), or infection (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05; very low‐quality evidence) when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroid‐containing immunosuppression. Acute rejection and glucocorticosteroid‐resistant rejection were statistically significantly more frequent when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroid‐containing immunosuppression (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence; and RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.02; very low‐quality evidence). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were statistically significantly less frequent when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroid‐containing immunosuppression (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99; low‐quality evidence; and RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90; low‐quality evidence). We performed Trial Sequential Analysis for all outcomes. None of the outcomes crossed the monitoring boundaries or reached the required information size. Hence, we cannot exclude random errors from the results of the conventional meta‐analyses.
