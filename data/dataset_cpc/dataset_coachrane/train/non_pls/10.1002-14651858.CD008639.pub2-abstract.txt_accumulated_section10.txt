Background
Automated systems use closed‐loop control to enable ventilators to perform basic and advanced functions while supporting respiration. Selected automated systems can now not only measure selected respiratory variables and adapt ventilator output to individual patient needs by operationalizing predetermined algorithms but also automate the conduct of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). 
Objectives
To summarize the evidence comparing automated weaning and SBT systems to non‐automated mechanical ventilation strategies on time to mechanical ventilation discontinuation in adult postoperative patients. In secondary objectives we ascertained differences between automated weaning and SBT systems and non‐automated mechanical ventilation discontinuation strategies on clinical outcomes (time to successful extubation, time to first SBT and first successful SBT, mortality, total duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay, use of non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) following extubation, and adverse events). 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to May 2013); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to May 2013); CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to May 2013), Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and Ovid Health Star (1999 to May 2013), conference proceedings, trial registration websites, and contacted authors and content experts to identify potentially eligible trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials comparing automated weaning and SBT systems to non‐automated mechanical ventilation discontinuation strategies in intubated adults in the postoperative setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were planned to assess the impact of the type of (i) clinician primarily involved in implementing the automated weaning and SBT systems, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU), and (iii) non‐automated discontinuation (control) strategy utilized on selected outcomes.
