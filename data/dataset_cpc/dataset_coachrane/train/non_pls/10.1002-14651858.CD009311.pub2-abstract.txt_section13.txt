Results showed that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of hepatic VOD (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 15, 95% CI 7 to 50, low quality of evidence), but there was no evidence of difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18, low quality of evidence). It may reduce all‚Äêcause mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; NNTB 17, 95% CI 8 to 431, low quality of evidence) and mortality due to hepatic VOD (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87; NNTB 34, 95% CI 16 to 220, very low quality of evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the incidence of hepatic VOD between treatment and control groups for heparin (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.26, very low quality of evidence), LMWH (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.18, very low quality of evidence), defibrotide (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.02, low quality of evidence), glutamine (no hepatic VOD in either group, very low quality of evidence), FFP (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.17, very low quality of evidence), antithrombin III (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.15, very low quality of evidence), between heparin and LMWH (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.77, very low quality of evidence), between heparin and PGE1 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.50, very low quality of evidence), and between LMWH and PGE1 (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.55, very low quality of evidence). There was no evidence of difference in survival between treatment and control groups for heparin (92.6% vs. 88.7%) and defibrotide (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, low quality of evidence). There were no data on survival for trials of LMWH, glutamine, FFP, antithrombin III, between heparin and LMWH, between heparin and PGE1, and between LMWH and PGE1. There were no data on quality of life (QoL) for any trials. Eleven trials reported adverse events. There was no evidence of difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment and control groups except for one trial showing that defibrotide resulted in more adverse events compared with no treatment (RR 18.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 320.45). These adverse events included coagulopathy, gastrointestinal disorders, haemorrhage and microangiopathy. The quality of evidence was low or very low due to bias of study design, and inconsistent and imprecise results.
