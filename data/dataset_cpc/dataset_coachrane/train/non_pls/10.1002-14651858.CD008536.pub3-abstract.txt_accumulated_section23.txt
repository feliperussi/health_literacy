Background
Tibolone is a synthetic steroid used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, on the basis of short‐term data suggesting its efficacy. We considered the balance between the benefits and risks of tibolone. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tibolone for treatment of postmenopausal and perimenopausal women. 
Search methods
In October 2015, we searched the Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO (from inception), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and clinicaltrials.gov. We checked the reference lists in articles retrieved. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tibolone versus placebo, oestrogens and/or combined hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal and perimenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. Primary outcomes were vasomotor symptoms, unscheduled vaginal bleeding and long‐term adverse events. We evaluated safety outcomes and bleeding in studies including women either with or without menopausal symptoms. 
Main results
We included 46 RCTs (19,976 women). Most RCTs evaluated tibolone for treating menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Some had other objectives, such as assessment of bleeding patterns, endometrial safety, bone health, sexuality and safety in women with a history of breast cancer. Two included women with uterine leiomyoma or lupus erythematosus. 
Tibolone versus placebo  
Vasomotor symptoms 
Tibolone was more effective than placebo (standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.10 to ‐0.89; seven RCTs; 1657 women; moderate‐quality evidence), but removing trials at high risk of attrition bias attenuated this effect (SMD ‐0.61, 95% CI ‐0.73 to ‐0.49; odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 85% CI 0.27 to 0.41). This suggests that if 67% of women taking placebo experience vasomotor symptoms, between 35% and 45% of women taking tibolone will do so. 
Unscheduled bleeding 
Tibolone was associated with greater likelihood of bleeding (OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.70; nine RCTs; 7814 women; I2 = 43%; moderate‐quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo experience unscheduled bleeding, between 31% and 44% of women taking tibolone will do so. 
Long‐term adverse events 
Most of the studies reporting these outcomes provided follow‐up of two to three years (range three months to three years). 
Breast cancer 
We found no evidence of differences between groups among women with no history of breast cancer (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.25; four RCTs; 5500 women; I2= 17%; very low‐quality evidence). Among women with a history of breast cancer, tibolone was associated with increased risk (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.85; two RCTs; 3165 women; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Cerebrovascular events 
We found no conclusive evidence of differences between groups in cerebrovascular events (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.04; four RCTs; 7930 women; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). We obtained most data from a single RCT (n = 4506) of osteoporotic women aged 60 to 85 years, which was stopped prematurely for increased risk of stroke.
