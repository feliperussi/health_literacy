Background
Levodopa plus dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor is a common treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS). 
Objectives
To evaluate efficacy and safety of levodopa for RLS compared to placebo and other active agents. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, from January 1985 to December 2008, reference lists of articles, and contacted pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
We included double‐blind randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating levodopa treatment versus placebo or other treatment for at least seven days in patients with RLS (age ≥ 18 years). Outcomes included symptom severity, CGI‐I, objective as well as self rated sleep parameters, quality of life, and safety parameters. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional information. We collected dropouts due to adverse events and patients experiencing adverse events. 
Main results
Six placebo controlled and three active controlled RCTs were included (521 participants). Symptom severity (11 point rating scale, 0 points indicating no symptoms, 10 points indicating maximally severe symptoms) was more reduced with levodopa than placebo in two studies (mean difference (MD) ‐1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.18 to ‐0.5, P = 0.002). Periodic limb movements in sleep per hour of sleep (PLMS‐Index; PLMSI) improved by ‐26.28/h compared to placebo (95% CI ‐30.53 to ‐22.02, P < 0.00001).The CGI‐I changed more with levodopa than placebo in two studies (MD ‐1.25, 95% CI ‐1.89 to ‐0.62, P = 0.0001). In two studies, sleep quality (sleep questionnaire, visual analogue scale) showed a large effect (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.33, P < 0.00001) whereas quality of life (50 mm Visual Analogue Scales) improved by 3.23 compared to placebo (95% CI 1.64 to 4.82, P < 0.0001). Few patients dropped out of treatment (3 of 218 patients) but more levodopa treated patients experienced adverse events than with placebo (odds ratio 2.61, 95% CI 1.35 to 5.04, P = 0.004). Two dopamine agonist controlled studies showed smaller effects with levodopa than cabergoline and pramipexole on the IRLS (MD 5.25, 95% CI 2.10 to 8.40, P =0.001), CGI‐I (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87, P < 0.00001), and quality of life (MD 5.54, 95% CI 2.65 to 8.43, P = 0.0002). 
Authors' conclusions
Levodopa is efficacious for the short‐term treatment of RLS. Augmentation, the clinically most relevant adverse event, was not investigated sufficiently.
