Background
Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection is one of the most tragic consequences of the HIV epidemic, especially in resource‐limited countries, resulting in about 650 000 new paediatric HIV infections each year worldwide. The paediatric HIV epidemic threatens to seriously undermine decade‐old child survival programmes. 
Objectives
To estimate the effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV and infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as tolerability of vaginal disinfection in HIV‐infected women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Register, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, LILACS, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS, using standardised methodological filters for identifying trials. We also searched reference lists of identified articles, relevant editorials, expert opinions and letters to journal editors, and abstracts and proceedings of relevant conferences, and contacted subject experts and pharmaceutical companies. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials or clinical trials comparing vaginal disinfection during labour with placebo or no treatment, in known HIV‐infected pregnant women. Trials had to include an estimate of the effect of vaginal disinfection on MTCT of HIV and or infant and maternal mortality and morbidity. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Meta‐analysis was performed using the Yusuf‐Peto modification of Mantel‐Haenszel's fixed effect method. 
Main results
Only two trials that included 708 patients met the inclusion criteria. The effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.33), neonatal death (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.30 to 6.33), and death after the neonatal period (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.45) is uncertain. There was no evidence that vaginal disinfection increased adverse effects in mothers (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.22), and evidence from one trial showed that adverse effects decreased in neonates (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31).
