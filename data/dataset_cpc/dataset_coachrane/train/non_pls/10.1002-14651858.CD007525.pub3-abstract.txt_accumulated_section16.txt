Background
Chronic neutrophilic inflammation, in both the presence and absence of infection, is a feature of bronchiectasis in adults and children. The anti‐inflammatory properties of non‐steroid anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be beneficial in reducing airway inflammation, thus potentially improving lung function and quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of inhaled NSAIDs in the management of non‐cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children and adults: 
• during stable bronchiectasis; and
• for reduction of:
∘ severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations; and
∘ long‐term pulmonary decline.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, which includes reports identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched the trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trial portal. We carried out the latest searches on 22 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled NSAIDs versus a control (placebo or usual treatment) in children or adults with bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We reviewed the results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion.
Main results
One small, short‐term trial was eligible for inclusion. We included this study of 25 adults with chronic lung disease (only 32% of people included in the trial had bronchiectasis), as the other conditions were linked to development of bronchiectasis, and all were characterised by chronic sputum production. We were not able to obtain separate data for people with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. We judged that the study was at a high risk of selection bias.
