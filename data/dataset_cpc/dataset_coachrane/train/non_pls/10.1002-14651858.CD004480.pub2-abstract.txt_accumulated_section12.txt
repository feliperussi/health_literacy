Background
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic 'anti‐hepatitis' drug, used in China for chronic hepatitis B. Until now, systematic reviews of bicyclol therapy have not been performed. 
Objectives
To study the benefits and harms of bicyclol for patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2005), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2005), EMBASE (1980 to July 2005), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to July 2005), The Chinese Biomedical Database (1994 to August 2005), VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (1994 to August 2005), and China National Infrastructure (CNKI)(1994 to August 2005). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials with bicyclol versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions were included, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcome measures were mortality (total and liver‐related) and liver‐related morbidity (eg, cirrhosis and carcinoma). Secondary outcome measures were viral response and liver histology. 
Main results
The search identified one randomised clinical trial comparing bicyclol with bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate) for patients with hepatitis B. The follow‐up was three months. There was no evidence that bicyclol was superior to bifendate for loss of HBeAg (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.00), seroconversion of HBeAg to HBeAb (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.29), loss of HBV DNA (RR 1.19, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.53), or number of patients with normalised alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11 and RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20, respectively).
