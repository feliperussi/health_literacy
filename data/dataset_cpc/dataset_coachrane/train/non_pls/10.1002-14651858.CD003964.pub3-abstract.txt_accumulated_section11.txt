Background
Infection is one of the most common complications and still remains a significant cause of morbidity and occasionally mortality in patients, especially children with nephrotic syndrome. Many different prophylactic interventions have been used or recommended for reducing the risks of infection in nephrotic syndrome in clinical practice. Whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and which prophylactic intervention can be recommended for routine use based on the current evidence is still unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of any prophylactic intervention for reducing the risk of infection in children and adults with nephrotic syndrome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and Pre‐MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), China Biological Medicine Database (1979 to December 2009), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (to December 2009), China National Infrastructure (to December 2009), WangFang database (to December 2009), reference lists of nephrology textbooks, review articles, relevant studies and abstracts from nephrology meetings without language restriction.

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing any prophylactic interventions (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) for preventing any infection in children and adults with nephrotic syndrome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (appearance of infection, mortality, quality of life and adverse events). Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
