Background
Seclusion and restraint are interventions used in the treatment and management of disruptive and violent behaviours in psychiatry. The use of seclusion varies widely across institutions. The literature does offer numerous suggestions for interventions to reduce or prevent aggression. 
Objectives
1. To estimate the effects of seclusion and restraint compared to the alternatives for those with serious mental illnesses.  2. To estimate the effects of strategies to prevent seclusion and restraint in those with serious mental illnesses. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 1999) and The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1999) were supplemented with additional searches of Biological Abstracts (1989‐1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), EMbase (1980‐1999), MEDLINE (1966‐1999), MEDIC (1979‐1999), PsycLIT (1974‐1999), Sociofile (1974‐1999), SPRI & SWEMED (1982‐1999), Social Sciences Citation Index (1996‐1999), and WILP (1983‐1999). In addition, trials were sought by hand searching the reference lists of all identified studies and conference abstracts and contacting the first author of each relevant study. 
We updated this search 10 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials were included if they focused on the use (i) of restraint or seclusion; or (ii) of strategies designed to reduce the need for restraint or seclusion in the treatment of serious mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD).
