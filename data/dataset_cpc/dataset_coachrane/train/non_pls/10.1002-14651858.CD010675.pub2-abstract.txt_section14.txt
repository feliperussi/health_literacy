There is very low quality evidence from one single‐centre trial (57 participants), which included athletes only, that mosaicplasty resulted in higher patient‐reported function scores (probably the IKDC 2000 subjective knee evaluation score) compared with microfracture (range 0 to 100; higher score = better function) at one year follow‐up (MD 10.29 favouring mosaicplasty, 95% CI 7.87 to 12.71). Very low quality evidence from the same trial showed that this effect persisted in the long term at 10 years follow‐up. However, there is very low quality evidence from the two other trials (72 participants) of little difference in patient‐reported function, assessed via the Lysholm score (range 0 to 100; higher score = better function), between the two groups at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐1.10 favouring microfracture, 95% CI ‐4.54 to 2.33). One trial (25 participants) provided very low quality evidence of no significant difference between the two groups in quality of life or pain at long‐term follow‐up. Pooled results for treatment failure ‐ primarily symptom recurrence ‐ reported at long‐term follow‐up (means ranging from 6.3 to 1.4 years) in the three trials (129 participants) favoured mosaicplasty (10/64 versus 20/65; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90). Based on an illustrative risk of 379 treatment failures per 1000 patients treated with microfracture, there is very low quality evidence that 201 fewer patients (95% CI 38 to 288 fewer) would have treatment failure after mosaicplasty. All three trials reported activity scores but due to clear statistical and clinical heterogeneity, we did not pool the long term Tegner score results. There was very low quality evidence from one study (57 participants) of higher Tegner scores ‐ indicating greater activity ‐ at intermediate‐term and long‐term follow‐up in the mosaicplasty group; however, the between‐group difference may not be clinically important. The other two trials provided very low quality evidence of no significant difference between the two groups in activity scores.
