Background
Muscle soreness typically occurs after intense exercise, unaccustomed exercise or actions that involve eccentric contractions where the muscle lengthens while under tension. It peaks between 24 and 72 hours after the initial bout of exercise. Many people take antioxidant supplements or antioxidant‐enriched foods before and after exercise in the belief that these will prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidant supplements and antioxidant‐enriched foods for preventing and reducing the severity and duration of delayed onset muscle soreness following exercise. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, trial registers, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings up to February 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of all forms of antioxidant supplementation including specific antioxidant supplements (e.g. tablets, powders, concentrates) and antioxidant‐enriched foods or diets on preventing or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). We excluded studies where antioxidant supplementation was combined with another supplement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included trials using a pre‐piloted form. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials, generally using the random‐effects model. The outcomes selected for presentation in the 'Summary of findings' table were muscle soreness, collected at times up to 6 hours, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post‐exercise, subjective recovery and adverse effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Fifty randomised, placebo‐controlled trials were included, 12 of which used a cross‐over design. Of the 1089 participants, 961 (88.2%) were male and 128 (11.8%) were female. The age range for participants was between 16 and 55 years and training status varied from sedentary to moderately trained. The trials were heterogeneous, including the timing (pre‐exercise or post‐exercise), frequency, dose, duration and type of antioxidant supplementation, and the type of preceding exercise. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount. The majority of trials (47) had design features that carried a high risk of bias due to selective reporting and poorly described allocation concealment, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings. 
We tested only one comparison: antioxidant supplements versus control (placebo). No studies compared high‐dose versus low‐dose, where the low‐dose supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for the antioxidant involved. 
Pooled results for muscle soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after DOMS‐inducing exercise at all main follow‐ups: up to 6 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.56 to ‐0.04; 525 participants, 21 studies; low‐quality evidence); at 24 hours (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.00; 936 participants, 41 studies; moderate‐quality evidence); at 48 hours (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.07; 1047 participants, 45 studies; low‐quality evidence); at 72 hours (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.00; 657 participants, 28 studies; moderate‐quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.19; 436 participants, 17 studies; low‐quality evidence). When we rescaled to a 0 to 10 cm scale in order to quantify the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95% CIs for all five follow‐up times were all well below the minimal important difference of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (MD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.95 to ‐0.08); at 24 hours (MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.07); at 48 hours (MD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐0.69 to ‐0.12); at 72 hours (MD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.02); and at 96 hours (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.37). Thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very unlikely to equate to meaningful or important differences in practice. Neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect according to type of DOMS‐inducing exercise (mechanical versus whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed subgroup differences. Sensitivity analyses excluding cross‐over trials showed that their inclusion had no important impact on results.
