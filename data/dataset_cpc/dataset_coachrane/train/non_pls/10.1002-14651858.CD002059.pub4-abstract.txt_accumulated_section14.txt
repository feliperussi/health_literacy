Background
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opioid withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother‐infant relationship, sleep‐wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss, seizures and neurodevelopmental problems. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opioid for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opioids in newborn infants. 
Search methods
We ran an updated search on 17 September 2020 in CENTRAL via Cochrane Register of Studies Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for eligible trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐ and cluster‐RCTs which enrolled infants born to mothers with opioid dependence and who were experiencing NAS requiring treatment with an opioid. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 16 trials (1110 infants) with NAS secondary to maternal opioid use in pregnancy. Seven studies at low risk of bias were included in sensitivity analysis. 
Opioid versus no treatment / usual care: a single trial (80 infants) of morphine and supportive care versus supportive care alone reported no difference in treatment failure (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 4.07; very low certainty evidence). No infant had a seizure. The trial did not report mortality, neurodevelopmental disability and adverse events. Morphine increased days hospitalisation (mean difference (MD) 15.00, 95% CI 8.86 to 21.14; very low certainty evidence) and treatment (MD 12.50, 95% CI 7.52 to 17.48; very low certainty evidence), but decreased days to regain birthweight (MD ‐2.80, 95% CI ‐5.33 to ‐0.27) and duration (minutes) of supportive care each day (MD ‐197.20, 95% CI ‐274.15 to ‐120.25). 
Morphine versus methadone: there was no difference in treatment failure (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.67; 2 studies, 147 infants; low certainty evidence). Seizures, neonatal or infant mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were not reported. A single study reported no difference in days hospitalisation (MD 1.40, 95% CI ‐3.08 to 5.88; 116 infants; low certainty evidence), whereas data from two studies found an increase in days treatment (MD 2.71, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.21; 147 infants; low certainty) for infants treated with morphine. A single study reported no difference in breastfeeding, adverse events, or out of home placement.
