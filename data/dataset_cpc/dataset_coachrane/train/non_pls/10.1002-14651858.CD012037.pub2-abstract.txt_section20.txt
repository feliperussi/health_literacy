For the mother, insulin was associated with an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (not defined) compared to oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapy (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 3.12; four studies, 1214 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between those who had been treated with insulin and those who had been treated with an oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapy for the risk of pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; 10 studies, 2060 women; moderate‐quality evidence); the risk of birth by caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 17 studies, 1988 women; moderate‐quality evidence); or the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (metformin only) (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.44; two studies, 754 women; moderate‐quality evidence). The risk of undergoing induction of labour for those treated with insulin compared with oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapy may possibly be increased, although the evidence was not clear (average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; three studies, 348 women; I² = 32%; moderate‐quality of evidence). There was no clear evidence of difference in postnatal weight retention between women treated with insulin and those treated with oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapy (metformin) at six to eight weeks postpartum (MD ‐1.60 kg, 95% CI ‐6.34 to 3.14; one study, 167 women; low‐quality evidence) or one year postpartum (MD ‐3.70, 95% CI ‐8.50 to 1.10; one study, 176 women; low‐quality evidence). The outcomes of perineal trauma/tearing or postnatal depression were not reported in the included studies.
