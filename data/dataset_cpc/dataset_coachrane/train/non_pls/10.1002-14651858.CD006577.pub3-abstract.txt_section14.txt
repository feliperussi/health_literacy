Results indicate that music interventions have a small beneficial effect on psychological distress in people with CHD and this effect is consistent across studies (MD = ‐1.26, 95% CI ‐2.30 to ‐0.22, P = 0.02, I² = 0%). Listening to music has a moderate effect on anxiety in people with CHD; however results were inconsistent across studies (SMD = ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐1.17 to ‐0.22, P = 0.004, I² = 77%). Studies that used music interventions in people with myocardial infarction found more consistent anxiety‐reducing effects of music, with an average anxiety reduction of 5.87 units on a 20 to 80 point score range (95% CI ‐7.99 to ‐3.75, P < 0.00001, I² = 53%). Furthermore, studies that used patient‐selected music resulted in greater anxiety‐reducing effects that were consistent across studies (SMD = ‐0.89, 95% CI ‐1.42 to ‐0.36, P = 0.001, I² = 48%). Findings indicate that listening to music reduces heart rate (MD = ‐3.40, 95% CI ‐6.12 to ‐0.69, P = 0.01), respiratory rate (MD = ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.61 to ‐1.39, P < 0.00001) and systolic blood pressure (MD = ‐5.52 mmHg, 95% CI ‐ 7.43 to ‐3.60, P < 0.00001). Studies that included two or more music sessions led to a small and consistent pain‐reducing effect (SMD = ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.00, P = 0.05). The results also suggest that listening to music may improve patients' quality of sleep following a cardiac procedure or surgery (SMD = 0.91, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.79, P = 0.04).
