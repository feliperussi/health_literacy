Background
Prophylactic oophorectomy alongside hysterectomy in premenopausal women is a common procedure. The decision to remove or conserve the ovaries is often based on the perceived risk for ovarian cancer and the need for additional gynaecological surgical interventions, and is weighed against the perceived risk of negative health effects caused by surgically induced menopause. The evidence needed to recommend either prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy or conservation of ovaries at the time of hysterectomy in premenopausal women is limited. This is an update of the original version of this systematic review published in 2008. 
Objectives
To compare hysterectomy alone versus hysterectomy plus bilateral oophorectomy in women with benign gynaecological conditions, with respect to rates of mortality or subsequent gynaecological surgical interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (December 2005 to January 2014) and the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1985 to January 2014), and PsycINFO (1806 to January 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hysterectomy alone versus hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal women with benign gynaecological conditions were eligible. Any surgical approach could be used. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Study authors were contacted if information was unclear. 
Main results
Only one RCT comparing the benefits and risks of hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy was identified. The results of this pilot RCT have not been published and we have not been able to obtain the results. Therefore, no data could be included in this review.
