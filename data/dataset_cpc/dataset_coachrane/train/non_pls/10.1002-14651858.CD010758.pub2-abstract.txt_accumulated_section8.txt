Background
Vilanterol (VI) is a long‐acting beta2‐agonist (LABA) that binds to the beta2‐adrenoceptor on the airway smooth muscle, producing bronchodilation. LABA therapy, which is well established in adults as part of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for the Management of Asthma, leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function and reduction in exacerbations. At present, the commonly used LABAs licensed for use in asthma management (formoterol and salmeterol) require twice‐daily administration, whereas VI is a once‐daily therapy. 
Fluticasone furoate (FF) is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and ICS therapy is recommended by the BTS asthma guidelines. ICSs, the mainstay of asthma treatment, lead to a reduction in both airway inflammation and airway hyper‐responsiveness. Regular use leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function. ICSs are currently recommended as 'preventer' therapy for patients who use a 'reliever' medication (e.g. short‐acting beta2 agonist (SABA), salbutamol) three or more times per week. Most of the commonly used ICS treatments are twice‐daily medications, although two once‐daily products are currently licensed (ciclesonide and mometasone). 
At the present time, only one once‐daily ICS/LABA combination (FF/VI) is available, and several other combination inhalers are recommended for twice‐daily administration. 
Objectives
To compare effects of VI and FF in combination versus placebo, or versus other ICSs and/or LABAs, on acute exacerbations and on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults and children with chronic asthma.
