We included four RCTs (n = 1392 women) which administered the following interventions: bed rest (two trials), fibrin sealant (one trial), and mechanical closure of the cervix (one trial). Our primary outcome, live birth rate, was not reported in any of the included trials; nor were the data available from the corresponding authors. For the ongoing pregnancy rate, two trials comparing more bed rest with less bed rest showed no evidence of a difference between groups (odds ratio (OR) 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.31, 542 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were sporadically reported with the exception of the clinical pregnancy rate, which was reported in all of the included trials. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rate between more bed rest and less bed rest (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.31, 542 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or between fibrin sealant and usual care (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.78, 211 women, very low quality evidence). However, mechanical closure of the cervix was associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate than usual care (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.40 to 2.63, very low quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was rated as low or very low for all outcomes. The main limitations were failure to report live births, imprecision and risk of bias. Overall, the risk of bias of the included trials was high. The use of a proper method of randomisation and allocation concealment was fairly well reported, while only one trial clearly reported blinding. There was no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on adverse event rates but data were too few to reach any conclusions.
