Background
Preterm birth, defined as birth between 20 and 36 completed weeks, is a major contributor to perinatal morbidity and mortality globally. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORA), such as atosiban, have been specially developed for the treatment of preterm labour. ORA have been proposed as effective tocolytic agents for women in preterm labour to prolong pregnancy with fewer side effects than other tocolytic agents. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of tocolysis with ORA for women with preterm labour compared with placebo or any other tocolytic agent. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (published and unpublished) of ORA for tocolysis of labour between 20 and 36 completed weeks' gestation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. When required, we sought additional data from trial authors. Results are presented as risk ratio (RR) for categorical and mean difference (MD) for continuous data with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, the number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for harm (NNTH) were calculated. 
Main results
This review update includes eight additional studies (790 women), giving a total of 14 studies involving 2485 women. 
Four studies (854 women) compared ORA (three used atosiban and one barusiban) with placebo. Three studies were considered at low risk of bias in general (blinded allocation to treatment and intervention), the fourth study did not adequately blind the intervention. No difference was shown in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.43; random‐effects, (two studies, 152 women), perinatal mortality (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.38; two studies, 729 infants), or major neonatal morbidity. ORA (atosiban) resulted in a small reduction in birthweight (MD ‐138.86 g, 95% CI ‐250.53 to ‐27.18; two studies with 676 infants). In one study, atosiban resulted in an increase in extremely preterm birth (before 28 weeks' gestation) (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 9.51; NNTH 31, 95% CI 8 to 3188) and infant deaths (up to 12 months) (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.38 to 27.13; NNTH 28, 95% CI 6 to 377). However, this finding may be confounded due to randomisation of more women with pregnancy less than 26 weeks' gestation to atosiban. ORA also resulted in an increase in maternal adverse drug reactions requiring cessation of treatment in comparison with placebo (RR 4.02, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.85; NNTH 12, 95% CI 5 to 33). No differences were shown in preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation or any other adverse neonatal outcomes. No differences were evident by type of ORA, although data were limited.
