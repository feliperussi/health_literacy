Background
Inhaled steroids play a central role in the management of childhood asthma. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. However asthma may also cause growth retardation. Growth rates are not stable, so randomised controlled parallel group studies are needed to assess the impact of inhaled steroids on growth. This review is confined to one inhaled steroid, beclomethasone, that is known to have significant levels of systemic absorption. 
Objectives
To determine whether inhaled beclomethasone cause significant delay in the linear growth of children with asthma. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Airways Group asthma register was searched. Bibliographies from included studies, and known reviews were searched for additional citations. Personal contact with colleagues and researchers working in the field of asthma were made to identify potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomized, controlled trials comparing the effects of beclomethasone to non‐steroidal medication (placebo or non‐steroidal therapy) on the linear growth of children with asthma. 
Data collection and analysis
Data related to the clinical outcome "change in growth" were extracted by two reviewers working independently 
Main results
One hundred and fifty‐nine citations were identified by the search strategy and bibliography review. Three studies met the inclusion criteria. All used beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily delivered by dry powder Diskhaler to treat children with mild‐moderate asthma. Study duration was 7‐12 months. In all three studies, a significant decrease in linear growth occurred in children treated with beclomethasone compared to those receiving placebo or non‐steroidal asthma therapy. The average decrease, calculated through meta‐analysis, was ‐1.54 cm per year (95% CI ‐1.15, ‐1.94).
