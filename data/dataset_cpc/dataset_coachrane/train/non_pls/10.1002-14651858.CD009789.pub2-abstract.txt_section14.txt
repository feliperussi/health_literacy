Pooled results for muscle soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after DOMS‐inducing exercise at all main follow‐ups: up to 6 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.56 to ‐0.04; 525 participants, 21 studies; low‐quality evidence); at 24 hours (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.00; 936 participants, 41 studies; moderate‐quality evidence); at 48 hours (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.07; 1047 participants, 45 studies; low‐quality evidence); at 72 hours (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.00; 657 participants, 28 studies; moderate‐quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.19; 436 participants, 17 studies; low‐quality evidence). When we rescaled to a 0 to 10 cm scale in order to quantify the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95% CIs for all five follow‐up times were all well below the minimal important difference of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (MD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.95 to ‐0.08); at 24 hours (MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.07); at 48 hours (MD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐0.69 to ‐0.12); at 72 hours (MD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.02); and at 96 hours (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.37). Thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very unlikely to equate to meaningful or important differences in practice. Neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect according to type of DOMS‐inducing exercise (mechanical versus whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed subgroup differences. Sensitivity analyses excluding cross‐over trials showed that their inclusion had no important impact on results.
