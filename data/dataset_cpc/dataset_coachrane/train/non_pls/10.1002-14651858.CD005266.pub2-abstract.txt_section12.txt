We screened 4651 titles and abstracts identified by the search and assessed 92 full‐texts/records for inclusion. We included one cluster‐randomised trial, the ADDITION‐Cambridge study, which involved 20,184 participants from 33 general practices in Eastern England and assessed the effects of inviting versus not inviting high‐risk individuals to screening for diabetes. The diabetes risk score was used to identify high‐risk individuals; it comprised variables relating to age, sex, body mass index, and the use of prescribed steroid and anti‐hypertensive medication. Twenty‐seven practices were randomised to the screening group (11,737 participants actually attending screening) and 5 practices to the no‐screening group (4137 participants). In both groups, 36% of participants were women; the average age of participants was 58.2 years in the screening group and 57.9 years in the no‐screening group. Almost half of participants in both groups were on antihypertensive medication. The findings from the first phase of this study indicate that screening compared to no screening for type 2 diabetes did not show a clear difference in all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.25, low‐certainty evidence). Screening compared to no screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus showed an HR of 1.26, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.12 (low‐certainty evidence) for diabetes‐related mortality (based on whether diabetes was reported as a cause of death on the death certificate). Diabetes‐related morbidity and health‐related quality of life were only reported in a subsample and did not show a substantial difference between the screening intervention and control. The included study did not report on adverse events, incidence of type 2 diabetes, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and socioeconomic effects.
