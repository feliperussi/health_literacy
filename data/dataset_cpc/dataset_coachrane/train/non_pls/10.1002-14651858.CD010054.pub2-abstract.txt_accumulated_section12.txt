Background
Beta‐blockers are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. We do not know whether the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta‐blockers varies across the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta‐blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA). 
Objectives
To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24‐hour period in adults with essential hypertension. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We sought to include all randomised and non‐randomised trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow‐up of three weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end‐point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24‐hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device. 
Main results
Fourteen non‐randomised baseline controlled trials of BBPAA met our inclusion criteria, but only seven studies, involving 121 participants, reported hourly ambulatory BP data that could be included in the meta‐analysis. Beta‐blockers studied included acebutalol, pindolol and bopindolol. We judged most studies at high or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for all outcomes.
