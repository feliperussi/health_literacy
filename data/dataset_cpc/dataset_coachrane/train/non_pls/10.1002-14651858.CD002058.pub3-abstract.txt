Background
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants and inflammation plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. The use of inhaled corticosteroids may modulate the inflammatory process without concomitant high systemic steroid concentrations and less risk of adverse effects. This is an update of a review published in 2012 (Shah 2012). We recently updated the related review on "Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm neonates". 
Objectives
To determine the effect of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids started within the first 7 days of life on preventing death or BPD in ventilated very low birth weight infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 23 February 2017), Embase (1980 to 23 February 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 23 February 2017). We searched clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled versus systemic corticosteroid therapy (irrespective of dose and duration) starting in the first seven days of life in very low birth weight preterm infants receiving assisted ventilation. 
Data collection and analysis
Clinical outcomes data were extracted and analysed using Review Manager. When appropriate, meta‐analysis was performed using typical relative risk (RR), typical risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta‐analyses were performed using typical relative risk, typical risk difference (RD), and weighted mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). If RD was statistically significant, the number needed to benefit or the number needed to harm was calculated. We assessed the quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE principles. 
Main results
We included two trials that involved 294 infants. No new studies were included for the 2017 update. The incidence of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was not statistically significantly different between infants who received inhaled or systemic steroids (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35; RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.16; 1 trial, N = 278). The incidence of BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age among survivors was not statistically significant between groups (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.90; RD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.24; 1 trial, N = 206). There was no statistically significant difference in the outcomes of BPD at 28 days, death at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and the combined outcome of death or BPD by 28 days between groups (2 trials, N = 294). The duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group (typical MD 4 days, 95% CI 0.2 to 8; 2 trials, N = 294; I² = 0%) as was the duration of supplemental oxygen (typical MD 11 days, 95% CI 2 to 20; 2 trials, N = 294; I² = 33%). 
The incidence of hyperglycaemia was significantly lower with inhaled steroids (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.71; RD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.14; 1 trial, N = 278; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 7 to avoid 1 infant experiencing hyperglycaemia). The rate of patent ductus arteriosus increased in the group receiving inhaled steroids (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.17; RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.33; 1 trial, N = 278; NNTH 5, 95% CI 3 to 10). In a subset of surviving infants in the United Kingdom and Ireland there were no significant differences in developmental outcomes at 7 years of age. However, there was a reduced risk of having ever been diagnosed as asthmatic by 7 years of age in the inhaled steroid group compared with the systemic steroid group (N = 48) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.94; RD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.58 to ‐0.05; NNTB 3, 95% CI 2 to 20). 
According to GRADE the quality of the evidence was moderate to low. Evidence was downgraded on the basis of design (risk of bias), consistency (heterogeneity) and precision of the estimates. 
Both studies received grant support and the industry provided aero chambers and metered dose inhalers of budesonide and placebo for the larger study. No conflict of interest was identified. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that early inhaled steroids confer important advantages over systemic steroids in the management of ventilator‐dependent preterm infants. Based on this review inhaled steroids cannot be recommended over systemic steroids as a part of standard practice for ventilated preterm infants. Because they might have fewer adverse effects than systemic steroids, further randomised controlled trials of inhaled steroids are needed that address risk/benefit ratio of different delivery techniques, dosing schedules and long‐term effects, with particular attention to neurodevelopmental outcome.
