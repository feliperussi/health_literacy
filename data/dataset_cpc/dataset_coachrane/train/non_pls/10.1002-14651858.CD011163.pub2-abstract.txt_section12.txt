Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Some studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation (two trials), allocation concealment (two trials), blinding of outcome assessors (one trial) and incomplete outcome data (one trial). Duration and content of multiple risk factor interventions varied across the trials. Two trials recruited healthy participants and the other 11 trials recruited people with varying risks of CVD, such as participants with known hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Only one study reported CVD outcomes and multiple risk factor interventions did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.07, 232 participants, low‐quality evidence); the result is imprecise (a wide confidence interval and small sample size) and makes it difficult to draw a reliable conclusion. None of the included trials reported all‐cause mortality. The pooled effect indicated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD ‐6.72 mmHg, 95% CI ‐9.82 to ‐3.61, I² = 91%, 4868 participants, low‐quality evidence), diastolic blood pressure (MD ‐4.40 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.47 to ‐2.34, I² = 92%, 4701 participants, low‐quality evidence), body mass index (MD ‐0.76 kg/m², 95% CI ‐1.29 to ‐0.22, I² = 80%, 2984 participants, low‐quality evidence) and waist circumference (MD ‐3.31, 95% CI ‐4.77 to ‐1.86, I² = 55%, 393 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) in favour of multiple risk factor interventions, but there was substantial heterogeneity. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of these interventions on consumption of fruit or vegetables, smoking cessation, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol. None of the included trials reported on adverse events.
