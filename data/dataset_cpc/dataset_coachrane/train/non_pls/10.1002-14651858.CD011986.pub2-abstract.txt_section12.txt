We included nine RCTs, that involved 2633 people with STEMI and multi‐vessel coronary disease randomly assigned to either a complete (n = 1381) versus culprit‐only (n = 1252) revascularisation strategy. The complete and the culprit‐only revascularisation strategies did not differ for long‐term all‐cause mortality (65/1274 (5.1%) in complete group versus 72/1143 (6.3%) in culprit‐only group; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.11; participants = 2417; studies = 8; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). Compared with culprit‐only intervention, the complete revascularisation strategy was associated with a lower proportion of long‐term cardiovascular mortality (28/1143 (2.4%) in complete group versus 51/1086 (4.7%) in culprit‐only group; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.79; participants = 2229; studies = 6; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence) and long‐term non‐fatal myocardial infarction (47/1095 (4.3%) in complete group versus 70/1004 (7.0%) in culprit‐only group; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.89; participants = 2099; studies = 6; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). The complete and the culprit‐only revascularisation strategies did not differ in combined adverse events (51/2096 (2.4%) in complete group versus 57/1990 (2.9%) in culprit‐only group; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; participants = 4086; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). Complete revascularisation was associated with lower proportion of long‐term revascularisation (145/1374 (10.6%) in complete group versus 258/1242 (20.8%) in culprit‐only group; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; participants = 2616; studies = 9; I2 = 31%; very low quality evidence). TSA of long‐term all‐cause mortality, long‐term cardiovascular mortality, and long‐term non‐fatal myocardial infarction showed that more RCTs are needed to reach more conclusive results on these outcomes. Regarding long‐term repeat revascularisation more RCTs may not change our present result. The quality of the evidence was judged to be very low for all primary and the majority of the secondary outcomes mainly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness.
