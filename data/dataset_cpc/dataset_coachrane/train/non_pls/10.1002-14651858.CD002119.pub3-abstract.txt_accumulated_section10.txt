Background
Dysmenorrhoea (occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin) is a common gynaecological condition. The character of pain from musculoskeletal dysfunction can be very similar to gynaecological pain by presenting cyclicly and being altered by hormonal changes associated with menstruation. Medical treatment for dysmenorrhoea usually comprises anti‐inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, or surgical intervention. Spinal manipulation is a non‐medical intervention. It has been suggested that manipulation of the vertebrae may increase spinal mobility thus improving pelvic blood supply and facilitating pain relief. 
Objectives
To determine the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulative interventions for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or other medical treatment. 
Search methods
In this update we searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (May 2009), CENTRAL (to second quarter, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1980 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), and PsycINFO (1806 to May 2009). Citation lists of review articles and included trials were examined. 
Selection criteria
Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including spinal manipulative interventions (for example chiropractic, osteopathy, or manipulative physiotherapy) versus each other, placebo, no treatment, or another medical treatment were considered. Exclusion criteria were mild or infrequent dysmenorrhoea or dysmenorrhoea from an intrauterine device (IUD). 
Data collection and analysis
Two trials of high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation and one trial of the Toftness technique were included. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. No data were suitable for meta‐analysis. Data were therefore reported as descriptive data. The outcome measures were pain relief or pain intensity and adverse effects.
