Background
Glycoprotein (GP) IIb‐IIIa inhibitors are antiplatelet agents that act by antagonising GP IIb‐IIIa receptors on the platelet surface and block the final common pathway to platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen molecules that form bridges between adjacent platelets. Thus, GP IIb‐IIIa inhibitors could favour endogenous thrombolysis by reducing thrombus growth and preventing thrombus re‐formation through competitive inhibition with fibrinogen and, due to their mechanism of action, are likely to have a more profound antiplatelet effect with more rapid onset than conventional antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of individuals with acute coronary syndromes and during coronary angioplasty, GP IIb‐IIIa inhibitors could also be useful for the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke. 
Objectives
To assess the use of GP IIb‐IIIa inhibitors in people with acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate whether such treatments (1) reduce the proportion of patients who die or remain dependent, and (2) are sufficiently safe for general use. We wished to examine the effects GP IIb‐IIIa inhibitors alone or in combination with thrombolytic agents. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched 10 June 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2013), EMBASE (1980 to June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 5, 2013), and major ongoing clinical trials registers (June 2013). We also searched reference lists and contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
We aimed to analyse unconfounded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of GP IIb‐IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke. Only individuals who started treatment within six hours of stroke onset were included.
