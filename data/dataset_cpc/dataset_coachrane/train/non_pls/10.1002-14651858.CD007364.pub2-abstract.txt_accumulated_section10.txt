Background
For most patients who require intensive care, the success of clinical decision making and interventions is dependent on the accuracy of different physiological variables measured or obtained from samples using an arterial catheter. Maintaining the patency of these catheters is therefore essential for obtaining accurate measures, minimizing patient discomfort and reducing expenses incurred when an occluded catheter requires replacement. Uncertainty exists amongst clinicians as to best practice surrounding the contents of the arterial catheter flush solution (heparin or saline). The use of heparin is more expensive and is accompanied by significant risks such as haemorrhage, hypersensitivity and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate whether normal saline is as efficacious and safe as heparin in maintaining the patency of arterial intravascular catheters in adult patients without a haematological disorder. 
Search methods
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified through electronic database searches: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 1, part of The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to March 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1988 to March 2013) and CINAHL (1988 to March 2013), using specific strategies as advised by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Group search specialist. We contacted trial authors to ask for additional information as needed. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized studies irrespective of blinding or language that compared an arterial catheter flush solution comprising any dose of heparin versus an infusion of normal saline only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened for methodological quality and extracted data from all identified studies that met the protocol inclusion criteria.
