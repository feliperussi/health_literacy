Background
Ketogenic diets (KDs) are high in fat and low in carbohydrates and have been suggested to reduce seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Such diets may be beneficial for children with drug‐resistant epilepsy. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2003, and last updated in 2018.
Objectives
To assess the effects of ketogenic diets for people with drug‐resistant epilepsy.
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 April 2019) on 29 April 2019. The Cochrane Register of Studies includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of KDs for people of any age with drug‐resistant epilepsy.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied predefined criteria to extract data and evaluated study quality. We assessed the outcomes: seizure freedom, seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency), adverse effects, cognition and behaviour, quality of life, and attrition rate. We incorporated a meta‐analysis. We utilised an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population for all primary analyses. We presented the results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 13 studies with 932 participants; 711 children (4 months to 18 years) and 221 adults (16 years and over).
