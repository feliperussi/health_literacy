Background
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide. Due to improved early detection rates of gastric cancer and technological advances in treatments, a significant improvement in survival rates has been achieved in people with cancer undergoing gastrectomy. Subsequently, there has been increasing emphasis on postgastrectomy syndrome (e.g. fullness, delayed emptying, and cold sweat, amongst others) and quality of life postsurgery. However, it is uncertain which types of reconstruction result in better outcomes postsurgery. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence on health‐related quality of life and safety outcomes of Roux‐en‐Y and Billroth‐I reconstructions after distal gastrectomy for people with gastric cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase on 4 May 2021. We checked the reference lists of the included studies and contacted manufacturers and professionals in the field. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to Roux‐en‐Y reconstruction or Billroth‐I reconstruction after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life after surgery and incidence of anastomotic leakage. The secondary outcomes included body weight loss, incidence of bile reflux, length of hospital stay, and overall morbidity. We used a random‐effects model to conduct meta‐analyses. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
