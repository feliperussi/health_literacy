Background
Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia (who are transfusion‐dependent or non‐transfusion‐dependent) are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands; which can be prevented and treated with iron chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and well‐being, which may affect adherence. 
Objectives
To identify and assess the effectiveness of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi‐component interventions) to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with SCD or thalassaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Web of Science Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (01 February 2017). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (12 December 2017). 
Selection criteria
For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. 
For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational Interventions, or multi‐component interventions, non‐RCTs, controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 16 RCTs (1525 participants) published between 1997 and 2017. Most participants had β‐thalassaemia major; 195 had SCD and 88 had β‐thalassaemia intermedia. Mean age ranged from 11 to 41 years. One trial was of medication management and 15 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral‐chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. 
We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low across all outcomes identified in this review. 
Three trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. 
Deferiprone versus deferoxamine 
We are uncertain whether deferiprone increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (four trials, very low‐quality evidence). Results could not be combined due to considerable heterogeneity (participants' age and different medication regimens). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone (85% to 94.9%); deferoxamine (71.6% to 93%)). 
We are uncertain whether deferiprone increases the risk of agranulocytosis, risk ratio (RR) 7.88 (99% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 352.39); or has any effect on all‐cause mortality, RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.63) (one trial; 88 participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Deferasirox versus deferoxamine 
We are uncertain whether deferasirox increases adherence to iron chelation therapy, mean difference (MD) ‐1.40 (95% CI ‐3.66 to 0.86) (one trial; 197 participants; very‐low quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferasirox (99%); deferoxamine (100%)). We are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of thalassaemia‐related serious adverse events (SAEs), RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.17); or all‐cause mortality, RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.06) (two trials; 240 participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
We are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of SCD‐related pain crises, RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.62); or other SCD‐related SAEs, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.51) (one trial; 195 participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Deferasirox film‐coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) 
Deferasirox FCT may make little or no difference to adherence, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.22) (one trial; 173 participants; low‐quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (FCT (92.9%); DT (85.3%)). 
We are uncertain if deferasirox FCT increases the incidence of SAEs, RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.37); or all‐cause mortality, RR 2.97 (95% CI 0.12 to 71.81) (one trial; 173 participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone 
We are uncertain if deferiprone and deferoxamine combined increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (very low‐quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone 92.7% (range 37% to 100%) to 93.6% (range 56% to 100%); deferoxamine 70.6% (range 25% to 100%).
