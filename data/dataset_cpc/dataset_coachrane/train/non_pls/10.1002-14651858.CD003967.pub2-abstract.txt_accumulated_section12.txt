Background
Anaemia affects 60% to 80% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces quality of life and is a risk factor for early death. Treatment options are blood transfusion, erythropoietin (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa. Recently higher haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT) targets have been widely advocated because of positive associations with improved survival and quality of life from observational studies. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of different Hb or HCT targets in CKD patients receiving any treatment for anaemia. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library) MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980) and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different Hb/HCT targets in patients with the anaemia of CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
Twenty two trials (3707 patients) were included. Hb ≥ 133 g/L was not associated with a reduction in the risk of all‐cause mortality compared with 120 g/L in dialysis and pre‐dialysis patients. In pre‐dialysis patients, there was a significantly lower end of treatment creatinine clearance with Hb < 120 g/L compared to > 130 g/L (MD ‐4.17, 95% CI ‐6.33 to ‐2.02) but no significant difference in the risk of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.22). Lower Hb targets resulted in an increased risk for seizures (RR 5.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 24.34) and a reduced risk of hypertensive episodes (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.76). There were no significant differences in the risk of vascular access thrombosis.
