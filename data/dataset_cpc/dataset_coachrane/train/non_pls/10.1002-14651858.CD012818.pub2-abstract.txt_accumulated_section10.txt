Background
Adequate nutrients early in life promote cognitive development and are critical for proper growth and functioning. The effect of individual nutrients consumed through food is often not the same as consuming the same nutrients in supplementary form due to 'food synergy', the biological and chemical interrelations that occur between nutrients. Animal‐source foods, such as eggs, meat, fish, and dairy, are energy dense and contain multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids with high bioavailability. The benefits of animal‐source foods may include higher food synergy relative to fortified foods as well as decreasing dependence on external suppliers of fortified foods. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of animal‐source foods compared to any other feeding interventions or no intervention in improving growth and developmental outcomes in children aged 6 to 59 months. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 18 other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2018. We also contacted authors and known experts in the field for assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished data, and searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and websites of relevant organizations, for other studies that may not have been captured by our electronic searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials of any duration, where children between 5 months and 59 months (6 years) of age were provided with an animal‐source food (e.g. consumption of milk, meat, or eggs), prepared with any cooking method, compared with any intervention or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
