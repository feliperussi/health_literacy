Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common hospital‐acquired infection. The major associated cause is indwelling urethral catheters. Several measures have been introduced to reduce catheter‐associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). One of these measures is the introduction of specialised urethral catheters that have been designed to reduce the risk of infection. These include antiseptic‐coated and antimicrobial‐impregnated catheters. 
Objectives
The primary objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of different types of indwelling urethral catheters in reducing the risk of UTI and to assess their impact on other outcomes in adults who require short‐term urethral catheterisation in hospitals. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group's Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 9 September 2014). We also examined the bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted catheter manufacturer representatives for trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing types of indwelling urethral catheters for short‐term catheterisation in hospitalised adults. 'Short‐term' is defined as a duration of catheterisation which is intended to be less than or equal to 14 days. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or consultation with a third party. We processed data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
