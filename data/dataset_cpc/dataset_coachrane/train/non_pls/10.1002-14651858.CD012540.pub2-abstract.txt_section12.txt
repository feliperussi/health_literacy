A total of six RCTs (326 patients) evaluating therapeutic discontinuation in patients with quiescent CD were eligible for inclusion. In four RCTs azathioprine monotherapy was discontinued, and in two RCTs azathioprine was discontinued from a combination therapy regimen consisting of azathioprine with infliximab. No studies of biologic monotherapy withdrawal were eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies received unclear or low risk of bias ratings, with the exception of three open‐label RCTs, which were rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Four RCTs (215 participants) compared discontinuation to continuation of azathioprine monotherapy, while two studies (125 participants) compared discontinuation of azathioprine from a combination regimen to continuation of combination therapy. Continuation of azathioprine monotherapy was shown to be superior to withdrawal for risk of clinical relapse. Thirty‐two per cent (36/111) of azathioprine withdrawal participants relapsed compared to 14% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine therapy (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low quality evidence). However, it is uncertain if there are any between‐group differences in new CD‐related complications (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08, GRADE low quality evidence), adverse events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, GRADE low quality evidence), serious adverse events (RR 3.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 30.80, GRADE low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 19.04, GRADE low quality evidence). Common adverse events included infections, mild leukopenia, abdominal symptoms, arthralgias, headache and elevated liver enzymes. No differences between azathioprine withdrawal from combination therapy versus continuation of combination therapy were observed for clinical relapse. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52, P = 0.32; GRADE low quality evidence). The effects on adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.81, GRADE low quality of evidence) or serious adverse events are uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; GRADE very low quality of evidence). Common adverse events in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, arthralgias and infusion reactions.
