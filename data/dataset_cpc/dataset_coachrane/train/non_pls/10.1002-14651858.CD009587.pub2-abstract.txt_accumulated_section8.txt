Background
Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital. They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital. They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures. The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher/imaging/operating‐suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential. Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally. Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of femoral nerve block (FNB) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for initial pain management of children with fractures of the femur (thigh bone) in the pre‐hospital or in‐hospital emergency setting, with or without systemic analgesia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012 Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 01), Google Scholar (31 January 2013) and trial registries (31 January 2013). We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICB for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre‐hospital or in hospital emergency care. Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.
