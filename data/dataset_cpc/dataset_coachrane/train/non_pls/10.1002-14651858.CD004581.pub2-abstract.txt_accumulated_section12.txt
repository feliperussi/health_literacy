Background
Ventilator‐associated pneumonia is a common complication in ventilated patients. Endotracheal suctioning is a procedure that may constitute a risk factor for ventilator‐associated pneumonia. It can be performed with an open system or with a closed system. In view of suggested advantages being reported for the closed system, a systematic review comparing both techniques was warranted. 
Objectives
To compare the closed tracheal suction system and the open tracheal suction system in adults receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1) MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and LILACS from their inception to July 2006. We handsearched the bibliographies of relevant identified studies, and contacted authors and manufacturers. 
Selection criteria
The review included randomized controlled trials comparing closed and open tracheal suction systems in adult patients who were ventilated for more than 24 hours. 
Data collection and analysis
We included the relevant trials fitting the selection criteria. We assessed methodological quality using method of randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow up. Effect measures used for pooled analyses were relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data. We assessed heterogeneity prior to meta‐analysis. 
Main results
Of the 51 potentially eligible references, the review included 16 trials (1684 patients), many with methodological weaknesses. The two tracheal suction systems showed no differences in risk of ventilator‐associated pneumonia (11 trials; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12), mortality (five trials; RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.23) or length of stay in intensive care units (two trials; WMD 0.44; 95% CI ‐0.92 to 1.80). The closed tracheal suction system produced higher bacterial colonization rates (five trials; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.03).
