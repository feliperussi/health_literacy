Background
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), is an uncommon but severe condition in which there is a developmental defect in the fetal diaphragm, resulting in liver and bowel migrating to the chest cavity and impairing lung development and function for the neonate. This condition can be diagnosed during pregnancy and as such, is potentially amenable to in‐utero prenatal intervention. Neonatal surgical repair is possible, but even with early surgical repair and improving neonatal management, neonatal morbidity and mortality is high. Prenatal interventions described to date have included maternal antenatal corticosteroid administration and fetal tracheal occlusion, with both methods aiming to improve lung growth and maturity. However surgical procedures have potential maternal complications, as the uterus and amniotic sac are breached in order to gain access to the fetus. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of prenatal versus postnatal interventions for CDH on perinatal mortality and morbidity, longer‐term infant outcomes and maternal morbidity, and to compare the effects of different prenatal interventions with each other. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
All published (including those published in abstract form), unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing prenatal and postnatal interventions for fetuses with CDH. Quasi‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Trials using a cross‐over design are not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors evaluated trials for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results according to the stated eligibility criteria and extracted data independently. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We identified 11 studies for potential inclusion. Of those, we included three studies involving 97 women. Two additional studies are ongoing.
