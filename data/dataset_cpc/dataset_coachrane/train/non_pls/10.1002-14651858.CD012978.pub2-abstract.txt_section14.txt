For pre‐emptive NSAIDs, there is probably a decrease in early acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.69, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.41; studies = 36; participants = 2032; I2 = 96%; moderate‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies that reported on acute postoperative pain reported adverse events as an outcome. There may be little or no difference between the groups in short‐term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; studies = 2; participants = 100; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence) or long‐term nausea and vomiting (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; studies = 5; participants = 228; I2 = 29%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.00; studies = 28; participants = 1645; I2 = 97%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption with pre‐emptive NSAIDs (MD ‐5.62 mg, 95% CI ‐9.00 mg to ‐2.24 mg; studies = 16; participants = 854; I2 = 99%; low‐certainty evidence) and an increase in the time to analgesic request (MD 17.04 minutes, 95% CI 3.77 minutes to 30.31 minutes; studies = 18; participants = 975; I2 = 95%; low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in opioid adverse events such as pruritus (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.76; studies = 4; participants = 254; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence) or sedation (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.68; studies = 4; participants = 281; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence), although the number of included studies for these outcomes was small. No study reported patient satisfaction, chronic pain or time to first bowel movement for pre‐emptive NSAIDs.
