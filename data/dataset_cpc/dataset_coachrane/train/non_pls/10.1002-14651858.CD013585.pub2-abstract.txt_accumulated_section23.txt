Background
Arterial vascular access is a frequently performed procedure, with a high possibility for adverse events (e.g. pneumothorax, haemothorax, haematoma, amputation, death), and additional techniques such as ultrasound may be useful for improving outcomes. However, ultrasound guidance for arterial access in adults is still under debate. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of ultrasound guidance for arterial (other than femoral) catheterisation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL on 21 May 2021. We also searched IBECS, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 June 2021, and we checked the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials and cluster‐RCTs, comparing ultrasound guidance, alone or associated with other forms of guidance, versus other interventions or palpation and landmarks for arterial (other than femoral) guidance in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 48 studies (7997 participants) that tested palpation and landmarks, Doppler auditory ultrasound assistance (DUA), direct ultrasound guidance with B‐mode, or any other modified ultrasound technique for arterial (axillary, dorsalis pedis, and radial) catheterisation in adults.

Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound versus palpation and landmarks 
Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance may improve first attempt success rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.61; 4708 participants, 27 studies; low‐certainty evidence) and overall success rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16; 4955 participants, 28 studies; low‐certainty evidence), and may decrease time needed for a successful procedure (mean difference (MD) ‐0.33 minutes, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.13; 4902 participants, 26 studies; low‐certainty evidence) up to one hour compared to palpation and landmarks. Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance probably decreases major haematomas (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56; 2504 participants, 16 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance has any effect on pseudoaneurysm, pain, and quality of life (QoL) compared to palpation and landmarks (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound versus DUA 
One study (493 participants) showed that real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance probably improves first attempt success rate (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64; moderate‐certainty evidence) and time needed for a successful procedure (MD ‐1.57 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐1.36; moderate‐certainty evidence) up to 72 hours compared to DUA. Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance may improve overall success rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; low‐certainty evidence) up to 72 hours compared to DUA. Pseudoaneurysm, major haematomas, pain, and QoL were not reported. 
Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound versus modified real‐time B‐mode ultrasound 
Real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance may decrease first attempt success rate (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84; 153 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), may decrease overall success rate (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; 153 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), and may lead to no difference in time needed for a successful procedure (MD 0.04 minutes, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.09; 153 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence) up to one hour compared to modified real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance. It is uncertain whether real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance has any effect on major haematomas compared to modified real‐time B‐mode ultrasound (very low‐certainty evidence). Pseudoaneurysm, pain, and QoL were not reported. 
In‐plane versus out‐of‐plane B‐mode ultrasound 
In‐plane real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance may lead to no difference in overall success rate (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1051 participants, 8 studies; low‐certainty evidence) and in time needed for a successful procedure (MD ‐0.06 minutes, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.05; 1134 participants, 9 studies; low‐certainty evidence) compared to out‐of‐plane B‐mode ultrasound up to one hour. It is uncertain whether in‐plane real‐time B‐mode ultrasound guidance has any effect on first attempt success rate or major haematomas compared to out‐of‐plane B‐mode ultrasound (very low‐certainty evidence). Pseudoaneurysm, pain, and QoL were not reported. 
DUA versus palpation and landmarks 
DUA may lead to no difference in first attempt success rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 666 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence) or overall success rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 666 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases time needed for a successful procedure (MD 0.45 minutes, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.70; 500 participants, 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence) up to 72 hours compared to palpation and landmarks. Pseudoaneurysm, major haematomas, pain, and QoL were not reported.
