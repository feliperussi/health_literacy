Background
Adrenergic drugs have been used for the treatment of urinary incontinence. However, they have generally been considered to be ineffective or to have side effects which may limit their clinical use. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of adrenergic agonists in the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 15 September 2010) and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in adults with urinary incontinence which included an adrenergic agonist drug in at least one arm of the trial. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Main results
Twenty‐two eligible randomised trials were identified, of which 11 were crossover trials. The trials included 1099 women with 673 receiving an adrenergic drug (phenylpropanolamine in 11 trials, midodrine in two, norepinephrine in three, clenbuterol in another three, terbutaline in one, eskornade in one and Ro 115‐1240 in one). No trials included men. 
The limited evidence suggested that an adrenergic agonist drug is better than placebo in reducing the number of pad changes and incontinence episodes, as well as improving subjective symptoms. In two small trials, the drugs also appeared to be better than pelvic floor muscle training, possibly reflecting relative acceptability of the treatments to women but perhaps due to differential withdrawal of women from the trial groups. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the use of higher compared to lower doses of adrenergic agonists nor the relative merits of an adrenergic agonist drug compared with oestrogen, whether used alone or in combination.
