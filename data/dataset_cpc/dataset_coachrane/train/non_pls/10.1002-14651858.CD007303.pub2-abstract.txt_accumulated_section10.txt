Background
Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESAs) reduce anemia in cancer patients and may improve quality of life, but there are concerns that ESAs might increase mortality. 
Objectives
Our objectives were to examine the effect of ESAs and identify factors that modify the effects of ESAs on overall survival, progression free survival, thromboembolic and cardiovascular events as well as need for transfusions and other important safety and efficacy outcomes in cancer patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and conference proceedings for eligible trials. Manufacturers of ESAs were contacted to identify additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing epoetin or darbepoetin plus red blood cell transfusions (as necessary) versus red blood cell transfusions (as necessary) alone, to prevent or treat anemia in adult or pediatric cancer patients with or without concurrent antineoplastic therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing epoetin alpha, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alpha plus red blood cell transfusions versus transfusion alone, for prophylaxis or therapy of anemia while or after receiving anti‐cancer treatment. Patient‐level data were obtained and analyzed by independent statisticians at two academic departments, using fixed‐effects and random‐effects meta‐analysis. Analyses were according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. Primary endpoints were on study mortality and overall survival during the longest available follow‐up, regardless of anticancer treatment, and in patients receiving chemotherapy. Tests for interactions were used to identify differences in effects of ESAs on mortality across pre‐specified subgroups. The present review reports only the results for the primary endpoint.
