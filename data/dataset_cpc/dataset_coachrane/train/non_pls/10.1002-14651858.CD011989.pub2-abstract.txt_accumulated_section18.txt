Background
Multiple analgesic strategies for pain relief during labour are available. Recently remifentanil, a short‐acting opioid, has recently been used as an alternative analgesic due to its unique pharmacological properties. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effectiveness of remifentanil intravenous patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) for labour pain, along with any potential harms to the mother and the newborn. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (9 December 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), handsearched congress abstracts (November 2015), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised trials comparing remifentanil (PCA) with another opioid (intravenous (IV)/intramuscular (IM)), or with another opioid (PCA), or with epidural analgesia, or with remifentanil (continuous IV), or with remifentanil (PCA, different regimen), or with inhalational analgesia, or with placebo/no treatment in all women in labour including high‐risk groups with planned vaginal delivery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and appraised study quality. 
We contacted study authors for additional information other than incomplete outcome data. We performed random‐effects meta‐analysis. 
To reduce the risk of random error in meta‐analysis we performed trial sequential analysis. We included total zero event trials and used a constant continuity correction of 0.01 (ccc 0.01) for meta‐analysis. We applied the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Twenty RCTs with 3569 women were included. Of those, 10 trials (2983 participants) compared remifentanil (PCA) to an epidural, four trials (216 participants) to another opioid (IV/IM), three trials (215 participants) to another opioid (PCA), two trials (135 participants) to remifentanil (continuous IV), and one trial (20 participants) to remifentanil (PCA, different regimen). No trials were identified for the remaining comparisons. 
Methodological quality of studies was moderate to poor. We assessed risk of bias as high for blinding issues and incomplete outcome data in 65% and 45% of the included studies, respectively. 
There is evidence of effect that women in the remifentanil (PCA) group were more satisfied with pain relief than women in the other opioids (IV/IM) group (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 3.49, four trials, very low‐quality evidence), and that women were less satisfied compared to women in the epidural group (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.04, seven trials, very low‐quality evidence). 
There is evidence of effect that remifentanil (PCA) provided stronger pain relief at one hour than other opioids administered IV/IM (SMD ‐1.58, 95% CI ‐2.69 to ‐0.48, three trials, very low‐quality evidence) or via PCA (SMD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.00, three trials, very low‐quality evidence). Pain intensity was higher in the remifentanil (PCA) group compared to the epidural group (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.84, six trials, low‐quality evidence). 
Data were limited on safety aspects for both the women and the newborns. Only one study analysed maternal apnoea in a comparison of remifentanil (PCA) versus epidural and reported that half of the women in the remifentanil and none in the epidural group had an apnoea (very low‐quality evidence). There is no evidence of effect that remifentanil (PCA) was associated with an increased risk for maternal respiratory depression when compared to epidural analgesia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.62, ccc 0.01, three trials, low‐quality evidence) and no reliable conclusion might be reached compared to remifentanil (continuous IV) (all study arms included zero events, two trials, low‐quality evidence). In one trial of remifentanil (PCA) versus another opioid (IM) three out of 18 women in the remifentanil and none out of 18 in the control group had a respiratory depression (very low‐quality evidence).
