Background
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common hematologic disorder caused by immune‐mediated thrombocytopenia. The magnitude of the maternal‐fetal risk of ITP during pregnancy is controversial. Labour management of pregnant women with ITP remains controversial. Management of ITP during pregnancy is complex because of the disparity between maternal and fetal platelet counts. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, vinca alkaloids, danazol, dapsone, and any other types of pharmacological treatments for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura during pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (February 2009), LILACS (1982 to 8 February 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov (8 February 2009), Current Controlled Trials (16 February 2009), Google Scholar (16 February 2009) and ongoing and unpublished trials cited in the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on any medical treatments for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura during pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. 
Main results
This review included one RCT in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed. 
This RCT comparing the effect of betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) with no medication found no statistically significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 2.05) and neonatal bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.13). Review authors conducted an intention‐to‐treat analysis which showed similar findings: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.45 and RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.61, respectively. Maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal intracranial haemorrhage were not studied by this RCT.
