Background
A small number of patients with acute severe asthma require intubation and positive pressure ventilation. The beneficial effects of inhaled bronchodilators on acute asthma in spontaneously breathing subjects are well established, but there remain important questions regarding inhaled beta2‐agonists, for patients who are intubated and receiving ventilation. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of inhaled beta2‐agonists on asthmatic patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
Search methods
Randomized controlled trials were sought from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies, and bibliographies from known reviews and texts were searched. Searches are current as of September 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, controlled clinical trials involving adult patients with acute asthma, who were intubated and supported with positive pressure ventilation. We included studies of patients treated with beta2‐adrenergic agonist agents and a comparison group of either placebo, no medication, or 'standard' treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined all identified references. Two review authors independently reviewed the full text of any potentially relevant article. 
Main results
The initial search in 1999 yielded 152 abstracts. Of these, four articles were identified as potential trials. None of the four trials met the inclusion criteria for the review. Further searches up to September 2011 have identified an additional 117 references, none of which were suitable for inclusion. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find any relevant randomized controlled trials. Therefore, as yet no data are available to provide evidence for or against current practices regarding the use of inhaled beta2‐agonists in asthmatic subjects who are intubated and ventilated.
