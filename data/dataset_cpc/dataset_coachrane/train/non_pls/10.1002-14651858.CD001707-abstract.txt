Background
The operation of insertion of a hemiarthroplasty to the hip refers to replacement of the femoral head with a prosthesis, whilst retaining the natural acetabulum and acetabular cartilage. The main surgical approaches to the hip for insertion of the prosthesis can be broadly categorised as either 'anterior' via the anterior joint capsule, or 'posterior' through the posterior joint capsule. 
Objectives
To evaluate, based on evidence from randomised controlled trials, the effects of different surgical approaches for the insertion of a hemiarthroplasty to the hip has on clinical outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (up to February 2002). Articles of all languages were considered. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing insertion of a hemiarthroplasty by different surgical approaches. 
Data collection and analysis
Both reviewers independently assessed trial quality, using a 10 item scale, and extracted data. Wherever appropriate and possible, the data are presented graphically. 
Main results
One randomised trial was identified involving 114 patients. The trial had poor methodology (particularly in susceptibility to selection bias), inadequate follow‚Äêup of patients who withdrew, and there was limited reporting of results. Medical complications and mortality from six months to two years appeared greater in the posterior group; this difference in mortality, within the structure of the poor methodology, was statistically significant. No other differences were claimed to be significant. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine the optimum surgical approach for insertion of a hemiarthroplasty to the hip.
