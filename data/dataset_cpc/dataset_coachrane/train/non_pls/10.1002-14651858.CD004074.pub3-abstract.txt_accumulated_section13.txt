Background
Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. 
Main results
We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias. 
Maternal outcomes: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ˜3.5%, I2 0%) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ˜12%, I2 0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs. Mean blood loss was reported in only two trials with data for 1345 women, with no significant differences seen between groups; or for maternal haemoglobin values (mean difference (MD) ‐0.12 g/dL; 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.06, I2 0%) at 24 to 72 hours after the birth in three trials.
