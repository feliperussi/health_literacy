Background
Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements, involving omega‐3 and/or omega‐6 components, have been proposed as a therapy for dry eye. Omega‐3 PUFAs exist in both short‐ (alpha‐linolenic acid [ALA]) and long‐chain (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) forms, which largely derive from certain plant‐ and marine‐based foods respectively. Omega‐6 PUFAs are present in some vegetable oils, meats, and other animal products. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of omega‐3 and omega‐6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements on dry eye signs and symptoms. 
Search methods
CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, two other databases and three trial registries were searched in February 2018, together with reference checking. A top‐up search was conducted in October 2019, but the results have not yet been incorporated. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving dry eye participants, in which omega‐3 and/or omega‐6 supplements were compared with a placebo/control supplement, artificial tears, or no treatment. We included head‐to‐head trials comparing different forms or doses of PUFAs. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 34 RCTs, involving 4314 adult participants from 13 countries with dry eye of variable severity and etiology. Follow‐up ranged from one to 12 months. Nine (26.5%) studies had published protocols and/or were registered. Over half of studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. 
Long‐chain omega‐3 (EPA and DHA) versus placebo or no treatment (10 RCTs) 
We found low certainty evidence that there may be little to no reduction in dry eye symptoms with long‐chain omega‐3 versus placebo (four studies, 677 participants; mean difference [MD] ‐2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] ‐5.14 to 0.19 units). We found moderate certainty evidence for a probable benefit of long‐chain omega‐3 supplements in increasing aqueous tear production relative to placebo (six studies, 1704 participants; MD 0.68, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.09 mm/5 min using the Schirmer test), although we did not judge this difference to be clinically meaningful. We found low certainty evidence for a possible reduction in tear osmolarity (one study, 54 participants; MD ‐17.71, 95% CI ‐28.07 to ‐7.35 mOsmol/L). Heterogeneity was too substantial to pool data on tear break‐up time (TBUT) and adverse effects. 
Combined omega‐3 and omega‐6 versus placebo (four RCTs) 
For symptoms (low certainty) and ocular surface staining (moderate certainty), data from the four included trials could not be meta‐analyzed, and thus effects on these outcomes were unclear. For the Schirmer test, we found moderate certainty evidence that there was no intergroup difference (four studies, 455 participants; MD: 0.66, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 1.77 mm/5 min). There was moderate certainty for a probable improvement in TBUT with the PUFA intervention relative to placebo (four studies, 455 participants; MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.07 seconds). Effects on tear osmolarity and adverse events were unclear, with data only available from a single small study for each outcome.
