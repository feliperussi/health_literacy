Background
In the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered once or twice daily. A once daily treatment regimen is more convenient for the patient and may optimise home treatment. However, it is not clear whether a once daily treatment regimen is as safe and effective as a twice daily treatment regimen. This is the second update of a review first published in 2003. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of once daily versus twice daily administration of LMWH. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4). 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials in which LMWH given once daily is compared with LMWH given twice daily for the initial treatment of VTE. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently.
Main results
Five studies were included with a total of 1508 participants. The pooled data showed no statistically significant difference in recurrent VTE between the two treatment regimens (OR 0.82, 0.49 to 1.39; P = 0.47). A comparison of major haemorrhagic events (OR 0.77, 0.40 to 1.45; P = 0.41), improvement of thrombus size (OR 1.41, 0.66 to 3.01; P = 0.38) and mortality (OR 1.14, 0.62 to 2.08; P = 0.68) also showed no statistically significant differences between the two treatment regimens. None of the five included studies reported data on post‐thrombotic syndrome. 
Authors' conclusions
Once daily treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as twice daily treatment with LMWH.
