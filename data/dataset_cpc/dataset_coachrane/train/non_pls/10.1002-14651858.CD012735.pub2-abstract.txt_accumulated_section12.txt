Background
Pitavastatin is the newest statin on the market, and the dose‐related magnitude of effect of pitavastatin on blood lipids is not known. 
Objectives
Primary objectiveTo quantify the effects of various doses of pitavastatin on the surrogate markers: LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in participants with and without cardiovascular disease. 
To compare the effect of pitavastatin on surrogate markers with other statins. 
Secondary objectivesTo quantify the effect of various doses of pitavastatin on withdrawals due to adverse effects.  
Search methods
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for trials up to March 2019: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2019), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
RCT and controlled before‐and‐after studies evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of pitavastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks in participants of any age with and without cardiovascular disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included, and extracted data. We entered data from RCT and controlled before‐and‐after studies into Review Manager 5 as continuous and generic inverse variance data, respectively. Withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE) information was collected from the RCTs. We assessed all included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool under the categories of allocation (selection bias), blinding (performance bias and detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias.
