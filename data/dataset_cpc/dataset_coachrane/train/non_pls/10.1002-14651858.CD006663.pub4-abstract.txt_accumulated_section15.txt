Background
Anderson‐Fabry disease is an X‐linked defect of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Progressive renal insufficiency is a major source of morbidity, additional complications result from cardio‐ and cerebro‐vascular involvement. Survival is reduced among affected males and symptomatic female carriers. 
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010, and previously updated in 2013. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy compared to other interventions, placebo or no interventions, for treating Anderson‐Fabry disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register (date of the most recent search: 08 July 2016). We also searched 'Clinical Trials' on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS (date of the most recent search: 24 September 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of agalsidase alfa or beta in participants diagnosed with Anderson‐Fabry disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. 
Main results
Nine trials comparing either agalsidase alfa or beta in 351 participants fulfilled the selection criteria. 
Both trials comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue; aggregate results were non‐significant. One trial reported pain scores measured by the Brief Pain Inventory severity, there was a statistically significant improvement for participants receiving treatment at up to three months, mean difference ‐2.10 (95% confidence interval ‐3.79 to ‐0.41; at up to five months, mean difference ‐1.90 (95% confidence interval ‐3.65 to ‐0.15); and at up to six months, mean difference ‐2.00 (95% confidence interval ‐3.66 to ‐0.34). There was a significant difference in the Brief Pain Inventory pain‐related quality of life at over five months and up to six months, mean difference ‐2.10 (95% confidence interval ‐3.92 to ‐0.28) but not at other time points. Death was not an outcome in either of the trials. 
One of the three trials comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue and showed significant improvement: kidney, mean difference ‐1.70 (95% confidence interval ‐2.09 to ‐1.31); heart, mean difference ‐0.90 (95% confidence interval ‐1.18 to ‐0.62); and composite results (renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death), mean difference ‐4.80 (95% confidence interval ‐5.45 to ‐4.15). There was no significant difference between groups for death; no trials reported on pain.
