Background
Postpartum iron deficiency anaemia is caused by bleeding or inadequate dietary iron intake/uptake. This condition is defined by iron deficiency accompanied by a lower than normal blood haemoglobin concentration, although this can be affected by factors other than anaemia and must be interpreted in the light of any concurrent symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, and dizziness. Treatment options include oral or intravenous iron, erythropoietin which stimulates red blood cell production, and substitution by red blood cell transfusion. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and harms of the available treatment modalities for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (9 April 2015); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP), and the Latin‐American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS) (8 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials that compared a treatment for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia, including trials described in abstracts only. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. We included both open‐label trials and blinded trials, regardless of who was blinded. The participants were women with a postpartum haemoglobin of 120 g per litre (g/L) or less, for which treatment was initiated within six weeks after childbirth. 
Non‐randomised trials, quasi‐randomised trials and trials using a cross‐over design were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies for additional information.
