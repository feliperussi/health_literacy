Background
Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failure. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Thus, providing corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and 2015 prior to this update. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death in children and adults with sepsis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and the WHO Clinical Trials Search Portal, on 25 July 2019. In addition, we conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors, to identify additional studies as needed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care (antimicrobials, fluid replacement, and vasopressor therapy as needed) in children and adults with sepsis. We also included RCTs of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus of corticosteroids. 
Data collection and analysis
All review authors screened and selected studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data, which was checked by the others, and by the lead author of the primary study when possible. We obtained unpublished data from the authors of some trials. We assessed the methodological quality of trials and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Review authors did not contribute to assessment of eligibility and risk of bias, nor to data extraction, for trials they had participated in. 
Main results
We included 61 trials (12,192 participants), of which six included only children, two included children and adults, and the remaining trials included only adults. Nine studies are ongoing and will be considered in future versions of this review. We judged 19 trials as being at low risk of bias. 
Corticosteroids versus placebo or usual care  
Compared to placebo or usual care, corticosteroids probably slightly reduce 28‐day mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.99; 11,233 participants; 50 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in long‐term mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 6236 participants; 7 studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably slightly reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 8183 participants; 26 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). Corticosteroids reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay for all participants (mean difference (MD) ‐1.07 days, 95% CI ‐1.95 to ‐0.19; 7612 participants; 21 studies; high‐certainty evidence) and resulted in a large reduction in length of hospital stay for all participants (MD ‐1.63 days, 95% CI ‐2.93 to ‐0.33; 8795 participants; 22 studies; high‐certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of muscle weakness (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44; 6145 participants; 6 studies; high‐certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably do not increase the risk of superinfection (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19; 5356 participants; 25 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Corticosteroids increase the risk of hypernatraemia (high‐certainty evidence) and probably increase the risk of hyperglycaemia (moderate‐certainty evidence). Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that there is probably little or no difference in gastroduodenal bleeding, stroke, or cardiac events, and low‐certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in neuropsychiatric events.
