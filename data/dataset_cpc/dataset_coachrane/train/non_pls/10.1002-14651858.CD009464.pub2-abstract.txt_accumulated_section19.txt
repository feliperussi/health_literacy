Background
Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use. Cannabis‐based medications (cannabinoids) are based on its active element, delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and have been approved for medical purposes. Cannabinoids may be a useful therapeutic option for people with chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting that respond poorly to commonly used anti‐emetic agents (anti‐sickness drugs). However, unpleasant adverse effects may limit their widespread use. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of cannabis‐based medications for chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer. 
Search methods
We identified studies by searching the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS from inception to January 2015. We also searched reference lists of reviews and included studies. We did not restrict the search by language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a cannabis‐based medication with either placebo or with a conventional anti‐emetic in adults receiving chemotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently conducted eligibility and risk of bias assessment, and extracted data. We grouped studies based on control groups for meta‐analyses conducted using random effects. We expressed efficacy and tolerability outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included 23 RCTs. Most were of cross‐over design, on adults undergoing a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens ranging from moderate to high emetic potential for a variety of cancers. The majority of the studies were at risk of bias due to either lack of allocation concealment or attrition. Trials were conducted between 1975 and 1991. No trials involved comparison with newer anti‐emetic drugs such as ondansetron. 
Comparison with placeboPeople had more chance of reporting complete absence of vomiting (3 trials; 168 participants; RR 5.7; 95% CI 2.6 to 12.6; low quality evidence) and complete absence of nausea and vomiting (3 trials; 288 participants; RR 2.9; 95% CI 1.8 to 4.7; moderate quality evidence) when they received cannabinoids compared with placebo. The percentage of variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance was not important (I2 = 0% in both analyses). 
People had more chance of withdrawing due to an adverse event (2 trials; 276 participants; RR 6.9; 95% CI 1.96 to 24; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence) and less chance of withdrawing due to lack of efficacy when they received cannabinoids, compared with placebo (1 trial; 228 participants; RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.89; low quality evidence). In addition, people had more chance of 'feeling high' when they received cannabinoids compared with placebo (3 trials; 137 participants; RR 31; 95% CI 6.4 to 152; I2 = 0%). 
People reported a preference for cannabinoids rather than placebo (2 trials; 256 participants; RR 4.8; 95% CI 1.7 to 13; low quality evidence). 
Comparison with other anti‐emeticsThere was no evidence of a difference between cannabinoids and prochlorperazine in the proportion of participants reporting no nausea (5 trials; 258 participants; RR 1.5; 95% CI 0.67 to 3.2; I2 = 63%; low quality evidence), no vomiting (4 trials; 209 participants; RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence), or complete absence of nausea and vomiting (4 trials; 414 participants; RR 2.0; 95% CI 0.74 to 5.4; I2 = 60%; low quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis where the two parallel group trials were pooled after removal of the five cross‐over trials showed no difference (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.7) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). 
People had more chance of withdrawing due to an adverse event (5 trials; 664 participants; RR 3.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 12; I2 = 17%; low quality evidence), due to lack of efficacy (1 trial; 42 participants; RR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.9; very low quality evidence) and for any reason (1 trial; 42 participants; RR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.9; low quality evidence) when they received cannabinoids compared with prochlorperazine. 
People had more chance of reporting dizziness (7 trials; 675 participants; RR 2.4; 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1; I2 = 12%), dysphoria (3 trials; 192 participants; RR 7.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 39; I2 = 0%), euphoria (2 trials; 280 participants; RR 18; 95% CI 2.4 to 133; I2 = 0%), 'feeling high' (4 trials; 389 participants; RR 6.2; 95% CI 3.5 to 11; I2 = 0%) and sedation (8 trials; 947 participants; RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8; I2 = 31%), with significantly more participants reporting the incidence of these adverse events with cannabinoids compared with prochlorperazine. 
People reported a preference for cannabinoids rather than prochlorperazine (7 trials; 695 participants; RR 3.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 4.8; I2 = 51%; low quality evidence).
