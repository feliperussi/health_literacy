Background
Adherence to complex regimens for patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in DKD is still unknown. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with DKD.
Search methods
In January 2010 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and four Chinese medicine databases (CBM‐disc, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China National Infrastructure and WanFang). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs studying the benefits and harms of educational programmes for people with DKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). Data were pooled using the random effects model. 
Main results
Two studies (207 patients) were eligible. The methodological quality was not high. Compared with no educational programmes, educational programmes for patients with diabetes on dialysis improved patients' knowledge for the following outcomes: diagnosis (SMD 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.90); monitoring (SMD 1.51, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.01); hypoglycaemia (SMD 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.17), hyperglycaemia (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.25); medication with insulin (SMD 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68); oral medication (SMD 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to1.43); personal health habits (SMD 1.84, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.36); diet (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97); exercise (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.60); chronic complications (SMD 1.28, 95% CI 0.80 to1.75) and living with diabetes and coping with stress (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.15). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved general knowledge for the following outcomes: diabetes (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.26); patients' total self‐efficacy (MD 19.00, 95% CI 12.58 to 25.42) and patients' changes in beliefs on treatment effectiveness (MD 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) at the end of treatment, and general knowledge (MD 14.39, 95% CI 7.45 to 21.33); specific self‐efficacy in home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) (MD 11.28, 95% CI 1.92 to 20.64) and changes of beliefs on personal control (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61) at the end of three‐months follow‐up. For patients with diabetes on dialysis, educational programmes also showed improvement in the following self‐management behaviours: checking feet (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.63); using lotion (RR 9.71, 95% CI 2.45 to 38.56) and wearing appropriate shoes and socks (RR 4.39, 95% CI 1.87 to 10.32). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved the following behaviours: general diet (MD 0.73, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.36), specific diet (MD 1.02, 95% CI 0.42 to1.62) and HBGM (MD 2.13, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.08) at the end of treatment; and specific diet (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.06) and HBGM (MD 1.48, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.48) at the end of three‐months follow‐up. No data were available on changes in kidney function, incidence of cardiovascular events, change of patients' attitude or adverse events.
