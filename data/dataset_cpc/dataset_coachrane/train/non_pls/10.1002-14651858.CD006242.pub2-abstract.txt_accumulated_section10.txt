Background
Patients with breast cancer are classified as having cells that over‐express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2‐positive) or not (HER2‐negative). Typically, patients with HER2‐positive disease have a worse prognosis. Trastuzumab is a selective treatment that targets the HER2 pathway. The available evidence supporting trastuzumab regimens mostly relies upon surrogate endpoints and, although the efficacy results seem to support its use, other uncertainties have been raised about its net benefit in relation to transient cardiac toxicity and a long‐term increased risk of metastasis to the central nervous system. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapy with trastuzumab (overall) and in relation to the type of co‐administered regimen and the line of treatment, i.e. first‐line or beyond progression, in women with HER2‐positive metastatic breast cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCG) Specialised Register and used the search strategy developed by the CBCG to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (up to 17 January 2013). 
Selection criteria
RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted agents in women with HER2‐positive metastatic breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
We collected data from published trials. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes. Subgroup analyses included type of regimen (taxane‐containing, anthracycline‐containing, aromatase inhibitor‐containing or other) and treatment line (first‐line, beyond progression).
