Based on a single study, there was no significant difference in the rapidity of symptom relief between intravenous nitroglycerin/N‐acetylcysteine and intravenous frusemide/morphine after 30 minutes (fixed‐effect MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.65 to 0.05), 60 minutes (fixed‐effect MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.65 to 0.25), three hours (fixed‐effect MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.67) and 24 hours (fixed‐effect MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.31). There is no evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: requirement for mechanical ventilation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) change after three hours and 24 hours, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, heart rate change at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, three hours and 24 hours, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) change after three hours and 18 hours, cardiac output (CO) change at 90 minutes and three hours and progression to myocardial infarction. There is a significantly higher incidence of adverse events after three hours with nitroglycerin compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.16) based on a single study. There was no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following secondary outcome measures: SBP change after 30 and 60 minutes, heart rate change after 90 minutes, and PAOP change after 90 minutes. None of the included studies reported healthcare costs as an outcome measure. There were no data reported by any of the studies relating to the acceptability of the treatment to the patients (patient satisfaction scores).
