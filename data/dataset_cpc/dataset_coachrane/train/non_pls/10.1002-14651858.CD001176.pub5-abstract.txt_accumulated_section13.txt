Background
Pouchitis occurs in approximately 50% of patients following ileal pouch‐anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). 
Objectives
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of medical therapies for prevention or treatment of acute or chronic pouchitis. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from inception to 25 July 2018. We also searched references, trials registers, and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of prevention or treatment of acute or chronic pouchitis in adults who underwent IPAA for UC were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The primary outcome was clinical improvement or remission in participants with acute or chronic pouchitis, or the proportion of participants with no episodes of pouchitis after IPAA. Adverse events (AEs) was a secondary outcome. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome. 
Main results
Fifteen studies (547 participants) were included. Four studies assessed treatment of acute pouchitis. Five studies assessed treatment of chronic pouchitis. Six studies assessed prevention of pouchitis. Three studies were low risk of bias. Three studies were high risk of bias and the other studies were unclear. 
Acute pouchitis: All ciprofloxacin participants (7/7) achieved remission at two weeks compared to 33% (3/9) of metronidazole participants (RR 2.68, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.35, very low certainty evidence). No ciprofloxacin participants (0/7) had an AE compared to 33% (3/9) of metronidazole participants (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.98; very low certainty evidence). AEs included vomiting, dysgeusia or transient peripheral neuropathy. Forty‐three per cent (6/14) of metronidazole participants achieved remission at 6 weeks compared to 50% (6/12) of budesonide enema participants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.96, very low certainty evidence). Fifty per cent (7/14) of metronidazole participants improved clinically at 6 weeks compared to 58% (7/12) of budesonide enema participants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.74, very low certainty evidence). Fifty‐seven per cent (8/14) of metronidazole participants had an AE compared to 25% (3/12) of budesonide enema participants (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.78 to 6.73, very low certainty evidence). AEs included anorexia, nausea, headache, asthenia, metallic taste, vomiting, paraesthesia, and depression. Twenty‐five per cent (2/8) of rifaximin participants achieved remission at 4 weeks compared to 0% (0/10) of placebo participants (RR 6.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 111.71, very low certainty evidence). Thirty‐eight per cent (3/8) of rifaximin participants improved clinically at 4 weeks compared to 30% (3/10) of placebo participants (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.60, very low certainty evidence). Seventy‐five per cent (6/8) of rifaximin participants had an AE compared to 50% (5/10) of placebo participants (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.14, very low certainty evidence). AEs included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, proctalgia, vomiting, thirst, candida, upper respiratory tract infection, increased hepatic enzyme, and cluster headache. Ten per cent (1/10) of Lactobacillus GG participants improved clinically at 12 weeks compared to 0% (0/10) of placebo participants (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 65.90, very low certainty evidence).
