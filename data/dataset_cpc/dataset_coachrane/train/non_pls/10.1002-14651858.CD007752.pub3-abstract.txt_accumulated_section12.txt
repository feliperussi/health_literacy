Background
Over the last decade there has been enhanced awareness of the appreciable morbidity of thyroid dysfunction, particularly thyroid deficiency. Since treating clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism may reduce adverse obstetric outcomes, it is crucial to identify which interventions are safe and effective. 
Objectives
To identify interventions used in the management of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism pre‐pregnancy or during pregnancy and to ascertain the impact of these interventions on important maternal, fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 March 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared a pharmacological intervention for hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism pre‐pregnancy or during pregnancy with another intervention or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted the data.
Main results
We included four RCTs of moderate risk of bias involving 362 women. In one trial of 115 women, levothyroxine therapy to treat pregnant euthyroid (normal thyroid function) women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies was not shown to reduce pre‐eclampsia significantly (risk ratio (RR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 3.48) but did significantly reduce preterm birth by 72% (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80). Two trials of 30 and 48 hypothyroid women respectively compared levothyroxine doses, but both trials reported only biochemical outcomes. A trial of 169 women compared the trace element selenomethionine (selenium) with placebo and no significant differences were seen for either pre‐eclampsia (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 8.38) or preterm birth (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.20 to 4.61). None of the four trials reported on childhood neurodevelopmental delay.
