Background
There are a number of studies that suggest a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the symptoms of dementia. 
Objectives
The review assessed the evidence of clinical effectiveness of melatonin in the treatment of symptoms of dementia. Relevant primary outcomes were cognition, mood, behaviour, functions of daily living, and safety of melatonin use and secondary outcomes were quality of life, morbidity, mortality and length of time to institutionalization and caregiver stress. 
Search methods
The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 29 June 2009 using the terms: MELATONIN and N‐ACETYL‐5‐METHOXYTRYPTAMINE. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. 
The search of June 2009 retrieved several studies for consideration by the authors.
Selection criteria
All relevant, randomized controlled trials in which orally administered melatonin in any dosage was compared with a control group for the effect on managing cognitive, behavioral (excluding sleep), and mood disturbances of people with dementia of any degree of severity. 
Data collection and analysis
Two to three reviewers independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and risk of bias, and extracted data from the selected studies. Statistically significant differences in end‐points or changes in outcomes from baseline to end of treatment between the melatonin and control groups were examined. Each study was summarized using a measure of effect (e.g. mean difference) and meta‐analyses were conducted when appropriate.
