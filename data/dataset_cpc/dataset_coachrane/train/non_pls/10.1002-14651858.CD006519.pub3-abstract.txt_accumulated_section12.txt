Background
Acute diarrhoea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low‐income countries. Glucose‐based oral rehydration solution (ORS) helps replace fluid and prevent further dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Since 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the osmolarity of less than 270 mOsm/L (ORS ≤ 270) versus greater than 310 mOsm/L formulation (ORS ≥ 310). Polymer‐based ORS (for example, prepared using rice or wheat) slowly releases glucose and may be superior to glucose‐based ORS. 
Objectives
To compare polymer‐based oral rehydration solution (polymer‐based ORS) with glucose‐based oral rehydration solution (glucose‐based ORS) for treating acute watery diarrhoea. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources up to 5 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 5 September 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 5 September 2016), LILACS (1982 to 5 September 2016), and mRCT (2007 to 5 September 2016). We also contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and searched reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with acute watery diarrhoea (cholera and non‐cholera associated) that compared polymer‐based and glucose‐based ORS (with identical electrolyte contents). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the search results and risk of bias, and extracted data. In multiple‐treatment arms with two or more treatment groups, we combined outcomes as appropriate and compared collectively with the control group. 
Main results
Thirty‐five trials that included 4284 participants met the inclusion criteria: 28 trials exclusively included children, five included adults, and two included both adults and children.
