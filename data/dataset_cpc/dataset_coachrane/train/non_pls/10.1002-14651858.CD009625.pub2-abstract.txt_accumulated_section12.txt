Background
Prostate cancer is commonly diagnosed in men worldwide. Surgery, in the form of radical prostatectomy, is one of the main forms of treatment for men with localised prostate cancer. Prostatectomy has traditionally been performed as open surgery, typically via a retropubic approach. The advent of laparoscopic approaches, including robotic‐assisted, provides a minimally invasive alternative to open radical prostatectomy (ORP). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robotic‐assisted radical prostatectomy compared to open radical prostatectomy in men with localised prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) and abstract proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, up until 9 June 2017. We also searched bibliographies of included studies and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a direct comparison of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and robotic‐assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to ORP, including pseudo‐RCTs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data. The primary outcomes were prostate cancer‐specific survival, urinary quality of life and sexual quality of life. Secondary outcomes were biochemical recurrence‐free survival, overall survival, overall surgical complications, serious postoperative surgical complications, postoperative pain, hospital stay and blood transfusions. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and assessed the quality of the evidence according to GRADE. 
Main results
We included two unique studies with 446 randomised participants with clinically localised prostate cancer. The mean age, prostate volume, and prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) of the participants were 61.3 years, 49.78 mL, and 7.09 ng/mL, respectively.
