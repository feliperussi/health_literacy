All the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. One death occurred in the endoscopic drainage group (1/44; 2.3%), due to bleeding. There were no deaths in the other groups. The differences in the serious adverse events were imprecise. Short‐term health‐related quality of life (HRQoL; four weeks to three months) was worse (MD ‐21.00; 95% CI ‐33.21 to ‐8.79; participants = 40; studies = 1; range: 0 to 100; higher score indicates better) and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than the EUS‐guided drainage group (MD 8040 USD; 95% CI 3020 to 13,060; participants = 40; studies = 1). There were fewer adverse events in the EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage alone (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.73; participants = 47; studies = 1), or the endoscopic drainage group (indirect comparison: OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61). Participants with EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage also had shorter hospital stays compared to EUS‐guided drainage alone (MD ‐8.10 days; 95% CI ‐9.79 to ‐6.41; participants = 47; studies = 1), endoscopic drainage (indirect comparison: MD ‐7.10 days; 95% CI ‐9.38 to ‐4.82), or open surgical drainage group (indirect comparison: MD ‐12.30 days; 95% CI ‐14.48 to ‐10.12). The open surgical drainage group had longer hospital stays than the EUS‐guided drainage group (MD 4.20 days; 95% CI 2.82 to 5.58; participants = 40; studies = 1); the endoscopic drainage group had longer hospital stays than the open drainage group (indirect comparison: ‐5.20 days; 95% CI ‐7.26 to ‐3.14). The need for additional invasive interventions was higher for the endoscopic drainage group than the EUS‐guided drainage group (OR 11.13; 95% CI 2.85 to 43.44; participants = 89; studies = 2), and the open drainage group (indirect comparison: OR 23.69; 95% CI 1.40 to 400.71). The differences between groups were imprecise for the other comparisons that could be performed. None of the trials reported long‐term mortality, medium‐term HRQoL (three months to one year), long‐term HRQoL (longer than one year), time‐to‐return to normal activities, or time‐to‐return to work.
