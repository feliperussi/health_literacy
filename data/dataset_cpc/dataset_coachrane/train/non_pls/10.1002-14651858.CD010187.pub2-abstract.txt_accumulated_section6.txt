Background
Approximately 800 million women and children have anaemia, a condition thought to cause almost 9% of the global burden of years lived with disability. Around half this burden could be amenable to interventions that involve the provision of iron. Maize (corn) is one of the world's most important cereal grains and is cultivated across most of the globe. Several programmes around the world have fortified maize flour and other maize‐derived foodstuffs with iron and other vitamins and minerals to combat anaemia and iron deficiency. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of iron fortification of maize flour, corn meal and fortified maize flour products for anaemia and iron status in the general population.
