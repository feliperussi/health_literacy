When compared with PDT, people treated with anti‐VEGF agents (ranibizumab (one RCT), bevacizumab (two RCTs)), were more likely to regain vision. At one year of follow‐up, the mean visual acuity (VA) in participants treated with anti‐VEGFs was ‐0.14 logMAR better, equivalent of seven Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.20 to ‐0.08, 3 RCTs, 263 people, low‐certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of participants gaining 3+ lines of VA was 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.73, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate‐certainty evidence). At two years, the mean VA in people treated with anti‐VEGFs was ‐0.26 logMAR better, equivalent of 13 ETDRS letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.14, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low‐certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of people gaining 3+ lines of VA at two years was 3.43 (95% CI 1.37 to 8.56, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low‐certainty evidence). People treated with anti‐VEGFs showed no obvious reduction (improvement) in central retinal thickness at one year compared with people treated with PDT (MD ‐17.84 μm, 95% CI ‐41.98 to 6.30, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate‐certainty evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence that people treated with anti‐VEGF were more likely to have CNV angiographic closure at 1 year (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54, 2 RCTs, 208 people). One study allowed ranibizumab treatment as of month 3 in participants randomised to PDT, which may have led to an underestimate of the benefits of anti‐VEGF treatment.
