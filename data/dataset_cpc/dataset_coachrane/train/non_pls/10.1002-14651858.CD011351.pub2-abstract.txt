Background
Generalised itching is one of the most common dermatological symptoms in pregnant women. Having itchy skin during pregnancy may be very frustrating and can lead to poor sleep, exhaustion and impaired quality of life. There is a need for a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating itching in pregnancy. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating generalised itching (not caused by systemic diseases or skin lesions) in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2016) and the reference list of the one identified study. 
Selection criteria
All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for itching in pregnancy. 
Quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, RCTs using a cross‐over design, and studies reported in abstract form (without full text) were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the one trial report that was identified from the search strategy and this was subsequently excluded. 
Main results
There are no included studies as we did not identify any relevant trials.
Authors' conclusions
Generalised itching (not caused by systemic disease or skin lesions) is quite a common symptom in pregnancy. However, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide practice in terms of the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating this condition. 
Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of topical and systemic pharmacological interventions as well as any adverse effects of the interventions. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of itching, women’s satisfaction, sleep disturbance, and adverse effects.
