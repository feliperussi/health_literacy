Background
Misoprostol is an orally active prostaglandin. In most countries misoprostol is not licensed for labour induction, but its use is common because it is cheap and heat stable. 
Objectives
To assess the use of oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 January 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing oral misoprostol versus placebo or other methods, given to women with a viable fetus for labour induction. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial data, using centrally‐designed data sheets. 
Main results
Overall, there were 75 trials (13,793 women); these were of mixed quality.
In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (1109 women), women using oral misoprostol were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.49; one trial; 96 women) and less likely to undergo caesarean birth (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; 8 trials; 1029 women). Differences in ‘uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes’ were compatible with no effect (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.84 to 8.68; 7 trials; 669 women). 
Ten trials compared oral misoprostol with vaginal prostaglandin (dinoprostone) (3,240 women). There was little difference in the frequency of: vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 5 trials; 2,128 women), uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 7 trials; 2,352 women), and caesarean birth (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.04; 10 trials; 3240 women). 
Five trials compared administration of oral misoprostol with intracervical prostaglandin E2 (681 women). Oral misoprostol was associated with fewer instances of failure to achieve vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97; 3 trials; 452 women) but more frequent uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.11 to 11.54; 3 trials; 490 women). The available data for this comparison were however limited and the differences in caesarean birth were small (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 5 trials; 742 women). 
Nine trials compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin (1282 women). There were no obvious differences in the frequency of: vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.05; 6 trials; 789 women), or uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.91; 7 trials; 947 women). There were, however, fewer caesarean births with oral misoprostol (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98; 9 trials; 1282 women).
