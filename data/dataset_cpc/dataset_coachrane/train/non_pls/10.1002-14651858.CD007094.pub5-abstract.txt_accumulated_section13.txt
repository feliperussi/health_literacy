Background
Cough causes concern for parents and is a major cause of outpatient visits. Cough can impact quality of life, cause anxiety, and affect sleep in children and their parents. Honey has been used to alleviate cough symptoms. This is an update of reviews previously published in 2014, 2012, and 2010. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for acute cough in children in ambulatory settings.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (2014 to 8 February 2018), Embase (2014 to 8 February 2018), CINAHL (2014 to 8 February 2018), EBSCO (2014 to 8 February 2018), Web of Science (2014 to 8 February 2018), and LILACS (2014 to 8 February 2018). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 12 February 2018. The 2014 review included searches of AMED and CAB Abstracts, but these were not searched for this update due to lack of institutional access. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing honey alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus no treatment, placebo, honey‐based cough syrup, or other over‐the‐counter cough medications for children aged 12 months to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included six randomised controlled trials involving 899 children; we added three studies (331 children) in this update. 
We assessed two studies as at high risk of performance and detection bias; three studies as at unclear risk of attrition bias; and three studies as at unclear risk of other bias.
