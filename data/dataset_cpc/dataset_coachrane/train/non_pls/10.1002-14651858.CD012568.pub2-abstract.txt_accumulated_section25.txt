Background
Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing (SRP)) as a non‐surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non‐surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. 
Data collection and analysis
We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long‐term follow‐up (≥ 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient‐reported quality of life changes. 
Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD ‐16.20%, 95% CI ‐25.87 to ‐6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD ‐0.47 mm, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD ‐0.30 mm, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD ‐8.06%, 95% CI ‐14.26 to ‐1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. 
Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD ‐12.20%, 95% CI ‐29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD ‐1.12 mm, 95% CI ‐2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD ‐1.11 mm, 95% CI ‐2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD ‐6.90%, 95% CI ‐22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. 
Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis: we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI ‐10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD ‐0.59 mm, 95% CI ‐1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD ‐0.77 mm, 95% CI ‐2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD ‐1.28%, 95% CI ‐4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes). 
Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. 
Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD ‐0.80 mm, 95% CI ‐1.49 to ‐0.11); and PD (MD ‐1.00 mm, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. 
Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis: we found very low‐certainty evidence of a difference in long‐term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD ‐2.30 mm, 95% CI ‐2.50 to ‐2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). 
Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: we found very low‐certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long‐term improvement in CAL (MD ‐1.70 mm, 95% CI ‐2.40 to ‐1.00); and PD (MD ‐1.80 mm, 95% CI ‐2.47 to ‐1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. 
Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: there was very low‐certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long‐term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. 
Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. 
Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD ‐0.90 mm, 95% CI ‐1.62 to ‐0.18); and PD (MD ‐0.80 mm, 95% CI ‐1.58 to ‐0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. 
Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very low‐certainty evidence (for long‐term follow‐up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non‐surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs.
