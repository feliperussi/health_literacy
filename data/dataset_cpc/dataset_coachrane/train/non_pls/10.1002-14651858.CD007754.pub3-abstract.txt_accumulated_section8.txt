Background
While maternal, infant and under‐five child mortality rates in developing countries have declined significantly in the past two to three decades, newborn mortality rates have reduced much more slowly. While it is recognised that almost half of the newborn deaths can be prevented by scaling up evidence‐based available interventions (such as tetanus toxoid immunisation to mothers, clean and skilled care at delivery, newborn resuscitation, exclusive breastfeeding, clean umbilical cord care, and/or management of infections in newborns), many require facility‐based and outreach services. It has also been stated that a significant proportion of these mortalities and morbidities could also be potentially addressed by developing community‐based packaged interventions which should also be supplemented by developing and strengthening linkages with the local health systems. Some of the recent community‐based studies of interventions targeting women of reproductive age have shown variable impacts on maternal outcomes and hence it is uncertain if these strategies have consistent benefit across the continuum of maternal and newborn care. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of community‐based intervention packages in reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality; and improving neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 May 2014), World Bank's JOLIS (25 May 2014), BLDS at IDS and IDEAS database of unpublished working papers (25 May 2014), Google and Google Scholar (25 May 2014). 
Selection criteria
All prospective randomised, cluster‐randomised and quasi‐randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of community‐based intervention packages in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidities, and improving neonatal outcomes.
