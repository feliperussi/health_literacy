Background
Prenatal care is recommended during pregnancy as a method to improve neonatal and maternal outcomes. Improving the use of prenatal care is important, particularly for women at moderate to high risk of adverse outcomes. Incentives are sometimes utilized to encourage women to attend prenatal care visits. 
Objectives
To determine whether incentives are an effective tool to increase utilization of timely prenatal care among women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 January 2015) and the reference lists of all retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs that utilized direct incentives to pregnant women explicitly linked to initiation and frequency of prenatal care were included. Incentives could include cash, vouchers, coupons or products not generally offered to women as a standard of prenatal care. Comparisons were to no incentives and to incentives not linked directly to utilization of care. We also planned to compare different types of interventions, i.e. monetary versus products or services. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We identified 11 studies (19 reports), six of which we excluded. Five studies, involving 11,935 pregnancies were included, but only 1893 pregnancies contributed data regarding our specified outcomes. Incentives in the studies included cash, gift card, baby carrier, baby blanket or taxicab voucher and were compared with no incentives. Meta‐analysis was performed for only one outcome 'Return for postpartum care' and this outcome was not pre‐specified in our protocol. Other analyses were restricted to data from single studies.
