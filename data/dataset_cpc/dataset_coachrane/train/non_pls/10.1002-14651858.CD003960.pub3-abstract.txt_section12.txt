In patients with C‐IBS, the relative risk (RR) of being a responder in terms of global relief of GI symptoms during the last 4 weeks of treatment was significantly higher with both tegaserod 12 mg and 4 mg doses compared with placebo. Although the pooled results indicate statistically significant benefit with tegaserod, the a priori minimal clinically important differences set in two of three studies were not reached. The responder rate for this endpoint was also higher when considered for the first 4 weeks of treatment (tegaserod 12 mg only). Tegaserod did not significantly improve the patients' individual symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort although bowel habit showed a statistically significant improvement with tegaserod 4 mg and there was a non‐significant trend in this outcome in favour of tegaserod 12 mg. In patients with chronic constipation, the RR of being a responder in terms of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week with tegaserod 12 mg was 1.54 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.75), WMD for this endpoint compared with placebo 0.6 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.78). Differences between tegaserod and placebo in increases in frequency of bowel movements were small (less than one per week). The proportion of patients with either diagnosis who experienced diarrhea was significantly higher in the tegaserod 12 mg group compared with placebo (RR 2.80, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.68), with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 20. Effects of tegaserod on GI symptoms such as bloating, stool consistency, and straining were not consistent across the studies.
