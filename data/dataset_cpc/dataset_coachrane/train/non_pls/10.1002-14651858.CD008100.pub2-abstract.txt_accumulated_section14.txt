Background
Single‐shot spinal anaesthesia (SSS) and combined spinal‐epidural (CSE) anaesthesia are both commonly used for caesarean section anaesthesia. Spinals offer technical simplicity and rapid onset of nerve blockade which can be associated with hypotension. CSE anaesthesia allows for more gradual onset and also prolongation of the anaesthesia through use of a catheter. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of CSE anaesthesia to single‐shot spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies (search date: 8 August 2019). 
Selection criteria
We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving a comparison of CSE anaesthesia with single‐shot spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We further subgrouped spinal anaesthesia as either high‐dose (10 or more mg bupivacaine), or low‐dose (less than 10 mg bupivacaine). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risks of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 trials including 1272 women, but almost all comparisons for individual outcomes involved relatively small numbers of women. Two trials did not report on this review's outcomes and therefore contribute no data towards this review. Trials were conducted in national or university hospitals in Australia (1), Croatia (1), India (1), Italy (1), Singapore (3), South Korea (4), Spain (1), Sweden (1), Turkey (2), UK (1), USA (2). The trials were at a moderate risk of bias overall. 
CSE versus high‐dose spinal anaesthesia 
There may be little or no difference between the CSE and high‐dose spinal groups for the number of women requiring a repeat regional block or general anaesthetic as a result of failure to establish adequate initial blockade (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 1.97; 7 studies, 341 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether having CSE or spinal makes any difference in the number of women requiring supplemental intra‐operative analgesia at any time after CSE or spinal anaesthetic insertion (average RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.43; 7 studies, 390 women; very low‐quality evidence), or the number of women requiring intra‐operative conversion to general anaesthesia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.95; 7 studies, 388 women; very low‐quality evidence). We are also uncertain about the results for the number of women who were satisfied with anaesthesia, regardless of whether they received CSE or high‐dose spinal (RR 0.93 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19; 2 studies, 72 women; very low‐quality evidence). More women in the CSE group (13/21) experienced intra‐operative nausea or vomiting requiring treatment than in the high‐dose spinal group (6/21). There were 11 cases of post‐dural puncture headache (5/56 with CSE versus 6/57 with SSS; 3 trials, 113 women) with no clear difference between groups. There was also no clear difference in intra‐operative hypotension requiring treatment (46/86 with CSE versus 41/76 with SSS; 4 trials, 162 women). There were no babies with Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (4 trials, 182 babies).
