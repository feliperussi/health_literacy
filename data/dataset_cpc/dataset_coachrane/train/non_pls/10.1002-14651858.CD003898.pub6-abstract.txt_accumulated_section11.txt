Background
Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life‐threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO₄ has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSO₄ is less clear. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSO₄ administered in acute asthma.
Specific aims: to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO₄ I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β₂‐agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled β₂‐agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled β₂‐agonist. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists. 
Selection criteria
RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO₄ alone or in combination with β₂‐agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co‐intervention alone or inactive control. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare.
