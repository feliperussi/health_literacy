Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies.
