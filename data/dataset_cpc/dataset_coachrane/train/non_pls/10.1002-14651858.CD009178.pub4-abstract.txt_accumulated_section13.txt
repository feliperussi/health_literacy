Background
Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non‐drug interventions are recommended as the first‐line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest‐activity, and sundowning. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed‐effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta‐analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin‐receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer‐reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). 
Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate‐to‐severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild‐to‐moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias.
