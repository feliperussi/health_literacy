Background
As estrogens have been found in animal models to be associated with the maintenance and protection of brain structures, it is biologically plausible that maintaining high levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women by medication could be protective against cognitive decline. 
Objectives
To investigate the effect of ERT (estrogens only) or HRT (estrogens combined with a progestagen) in comparison with placebo in RCTs on cognitive function in postmenopausal women. 
Search methods
The CDCIG Specialized Register was searched 7 March 2006. Additional searches were made of MEDLINE (1966‐2006/02); EMBASE (1985‐2006/02); PsycINFO (1967‐2006/02) and CINAHL (1982‐2006/01). 
Selection criteria
All double‐blind RCTs trials of the effect of ERT or HRT on cognitive function over a treatment period of at least two weeks in postmenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies, assessment of quality and extraction of data were undertaken independently by three reviewers with disagreements resolved by discussion. 
Main results
In total, 24 trials were included, but only 16 (10,114 women) had analysable data. Meta‐analyses showed no effects of either ERT or HRT on prevention of cognitive impairment after five and four years of treatment, respectively (odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.9; odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.54 respectively) (trend favouring control in both instances). Analyses assessing the effects of treatment over time found that both ERT and HRT did not maintain or improve cognitive function and may even adversely affect this outcome (WMD = ‐0.45, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.09; WMD = ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 0.26, respectively at maximum follow up). Negative effects were found for ERT after one year and HRT after three and four years of therapy. Results from smaller trials assessing effects on individual cognitive domains mostly reported no evidence of benefit.
