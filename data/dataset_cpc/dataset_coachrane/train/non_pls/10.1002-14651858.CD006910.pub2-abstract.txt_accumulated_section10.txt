Background
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women and it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The majority of ovarian tumours are epithelial in origin. Women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) often have a reduced performance status with a limited life expectancy, therefore maintaining quality of life with effective symptom control is the main purpose of treatment. Drug treatment of relapsed disease is directed by the platinum‐free interval: relapsed platinum‐sensitive disease is usually re‐treated with platinum‐based therapy and platinum‐resistant disease challenged with non‐platinum drugs. However, the side‐effects of chemotherapy agents may be severe and optimal treatment regimens are unclear. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), which contains a cytotoxic drug called doxorubicin hydrochloride is one of several treatment modalities that may be considered for single‐agent treatment of relapsed EOC, or used in combination with other drugs. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of PLD in women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group (CGCG) trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1990 to February 2013. We also searched online registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated PLD in women diagnosed with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently abstracted data to a pre‐designed data collection form and assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. Where possible, we pooled collected data in meta‐analyses using RevMan 5.2 software.
