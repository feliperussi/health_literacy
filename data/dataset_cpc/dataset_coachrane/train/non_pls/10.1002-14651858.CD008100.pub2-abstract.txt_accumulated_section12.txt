Background
Single‐shot spinal anaesthesia (SSS) and combined spinal‐epidural (CSE) anaesthesia are both commonly used for caesarean section anaesthesia. Spinals offer technical simplicity and rapid onset of nerve blockade which can be associated with hypotension. CSE anaesthesia allows for more gradual onset and also prolongation of the anaesthesia through use of a catheter. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of CSE anaesthesia to single‐shot spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies (search date: 8 August 2019). 
Selection criteria
We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving a comparison of CSE anaesthesia with single‐shot spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We further subgrouped spinal anaesthesia as either high‐dose (10 or more mg bupivacaine), or low‐dose (less than 10 mg bupivacaine). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risks of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 trials including 1272 women, but almost all comparisons for individual outcomes involved relatively small numbers of women. Two trials did not report on this review's outcomes and therefore contribute no data towards this review. Trials were conducted in national or university hospitals in Australia (1), Croatia (1), India (1), Italy (1), Singapore (3), South Korea (4), Spain (1), Sweden (1), Turkey (2), UK (1), USA (2). The trials were at a moderate risk of bias overall.
