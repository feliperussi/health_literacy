Compared to CMT, ET probably results in a higher rate of 30‐day death or stroke (risk ratio (RR) 3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 5.24; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), 30‐day ipsilateral stroke (RR 3.54, 95% CI 1.98 to 6.33; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), 30‐day ischaemic stroke (RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.62; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), and 30‐day haemorrhagic stroke (RR 15.53, 95% CI 2.10 to 115.16; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, low‐quality evidence). ET was also likely associated with a worse outcome in one‐year death or stroke (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.36; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), one‐year ipsilateral stroke (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.42; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), one‐year ischaemic stroke (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.13; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), and one‐year haemorrhagic stroke (RR 10.13, 95% CI 1.31 to 78.51; 2 RCTs, 521 participants, low‐quality evidence). There were no significant differences between ET and CMT in 30‐day transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.35, P = 0.39; 2 RCTs, 181 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), 30‐day death (RR 5.53, 95% CI 0.98 to 31.17, P = 0.05; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, low‐quality evidence), one‐year TIA (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.12; 2 RCTs, 181 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), one‐year death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.86, P = 0.68; 3 RCTs, 632 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), and one‐year dependency (RR 1.90, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.97, P = 0.09; 3 RCTs, 613 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). No data on restenosis and health‐related quality of life for meta‐analysis were available from the included trials. Two RCTs are ongoing.
