Cardiac rehabilitation may make little or no difference in all‐cause mortality over the short term (≤ one year of follow‐up) (27 trials, 28 comparisons (2596 participants): intervention 67/1302 (5.1%) vs control 75/1294 (5.8%); risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.21; low‐quality GRADE evidence) but may improve all‐cause mortality in the long term (> 12 months follow up) (6 trials/comparisons (2845 participants): intervention 244/1418 (17.2%) vs control 280/1427 (19.6%) events): RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; high‐quality evidence). Researchers provided no data on deaths due to HF. CR probably reduces overall hospital admissions in the short term (up to one year of follow‐up) (21 trials, 21 comparisons (2182 participants): (intervention 180/1093 (16.5%) vs control 258/1089 (23.7%); RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.83; moderate‐quality evidence, number needed to treat: 14) and may reduce HF‐specific hospitalisation (14 trials, 15 comparisons (1114 participants): (intervention 40/562 (7.1%) vs control 61/552 (11.1%) RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; low‐quality evidence, number needed to treat: 25). After CR, a clinically important improvement in short‐term disease‐specific health‐related quality of life may be evident (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure questionnaire ‐ 17 trials, 18 comparisons (1995 participants): mean difference (MD) ‐7.11 points, 95% CI ‐10.49 to ‐3.73; low‐quality evidence). Pooling across all studies, regardless of the HRQoL measure used, shows there may be clinically important improvement with exercise (26 trials, 29 comparisons (3833 participants); standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.39; I² = 87%; Chi² = 215.03; low‐quality evidence). ExCR effects appeared to be consistent different models of ExCR delivery: centre vs. home‐based, exercise dose, exercise only vs. comprehensive programmes, and aerobic training alone vs aerobic plus resistance programmes.
