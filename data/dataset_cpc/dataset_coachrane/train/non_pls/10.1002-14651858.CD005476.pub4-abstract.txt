Background
Laetrile is the name for a semi‐synthetic compound which is chemically related to amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside from the kernels of apricots and various other species of the genus Prunus. Laetrile and amygdalin are promoted under various names for the treatment of cancer although there is no evidence for its efficacy. Due to possible cyanide poisoning, laetrile can be dangerous. 
Objectives
To assess the alleged anti‐cancer effect and possible adverse effects of laetrile and amygdalin. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2014, Issue 9); MEDLINE (1951‐2014); EMBASE (1980‐2014); AMED; Scirus; CINAHL (all from 1982‐2015); CAMbase (from 1998‐2015); the MetaRegister; the National Research Register; and our own files. We examined reference lists of included studies and review articles and we contacted experts in the field for knowledge of additional studies. We did not impose any restrictions of timer or language. Searches updated June 2018 and no new studies identified. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.
Data collection and analysis
We searched eight databases and two registers for studies testing laetrile or amygdalin for the treatment of cancer. Two review authors screened and assessed articles for inclusion criteria. 
Main results
We located over 200 references, 63 were evaluated in the original review, 6 in the 2011 and none in this update. However, we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.
