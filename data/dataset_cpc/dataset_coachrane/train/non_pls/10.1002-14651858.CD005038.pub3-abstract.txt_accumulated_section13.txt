Background
Infant massage is increasingly being used in the community with babies and their primary caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for sleep, respiration and elimination, the reduction of colic and wind, and improved growth. Infant massage is also thought to reduce infant stress and promote positive parent‐infant interaction. 
Objectives
The aim of this review was to assess whether infant massage is effective in promoting infant physical and mental health in low‐risk, population samples. 
Search methods
Relevant studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases up to June 2011: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Maternity and Infant Care; LILACS; WorldCat (dissertations); ClinicalTrials.gov; China Masters' Theses; China Academic Journals; China Doctoral Dissertations; China Proceedings of Conference. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that randomised healthy parent‐infant dyads (where the infant was under the age of six months) to an infant massage group or a 'no‐treatment' control group. Studies had to have used a standardised outcome measure of infant mental or physical development. 
Data collection and analysis
Mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Where appropriate, the results have been combined in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included 34 studies, which includes one that was a follow‐up study and 20 that were rated as being at high risk of bias. 
We conducted 14 meta‐analyses assessing physical outcomes post‐intervention. Nine meta‐analyses showed significant findings favouring the intervention group for weight (MD ‐965.25 g; 95% CI ‐1360.52 to ‐569.98), length (MD ‐1.30 cm; 95% CI ‐1.60 to ‐1.00), head circumference (MD ‐0.81 cm; 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.45), arm circumference (MD ‐0.47 cm; 95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.13), leg circumference (MD ‐0.31 cm; 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.13), 24‐hour sleep duration (MD ‐0.91 hr; 95% CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.30), time spent crying/fussing (MD ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.52 to ‐0.19), deceased levels of blood bilirubin (MD ‐38.11 mmol/L; 95% CI ‐50.61 to ‐25.61), and there were fewer cases of diarrhoea, RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.76). Non‐significant results were obtained for cortisol levels, mean increase in duration of night sleep, mean increase in 24‐hour sleep and for number of cases of upper respiratory tract disease and anaemia.
