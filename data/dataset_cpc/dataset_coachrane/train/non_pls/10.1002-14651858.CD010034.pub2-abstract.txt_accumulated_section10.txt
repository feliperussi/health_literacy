Background
Since 1879, the year of the first documented medical telephone consultation, the ability to consult by telephone has become an integral part of modern patient‐centred healthcare systems. Nowadays, up to a quarter of all care consultations are conducted by telephone. Studies have quantified the impact of medical telephone consultation on clinicians' workload and detected the need for quality improvement. While doctors routinely receive training in communication and consultation skills, this does not necessarily include the specificities of telephone communication and consultation. Several studies assessed the short‐term effect of interventions aimed at improving clinicians' telephone consultation skills, but there is no systematic review reporting patient‐oriented outcomes or outcomes of interest to clinicians. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of training interventions for clinicians' telephone consultation skills and patient outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other electronic databases and two trial registers up to 19 May 2016, and we handsearched references, checked citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies and data. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomised controlled trials, non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating training interventions compared with any control intervention, including no intervention, for improving clinicians' telephone consultation skills with patients and their impact on patient outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies using standard Cochrane and EPOC guidance and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We contacted study authors where additional information was needed. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for data analysis.
