Background
While most guidance recommends the use of insulin in women whose pregnancies are affected by pre‐existing diabetes, oral anti‐diabetic agents may be more acceptable to women. The effects of these oral anti‐diabetic agents on maternal and infant health outcomes need to be established in pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus preconceptionally or during a subsequent pregnancy. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2010. 
Objectives
To investigate the effects of oral anti‐diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes who are planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes, on maternal and infant health. The use of oral anti‐diabetic agents for the management of gestational diabetes in a current pregnancy is evaluated in a separate Cochrane Review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs assessing the effects of oral anti‐diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes who were planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. Cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but none were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included RCTs. Review authors checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
