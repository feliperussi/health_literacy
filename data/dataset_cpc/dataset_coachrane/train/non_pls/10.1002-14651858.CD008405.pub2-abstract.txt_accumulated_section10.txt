Background
Dual practice, whereby health workers hold two or more jobs, is a common phenomenon globally. In resource constrained low‐ and middle‐income countries dual practice poses an ongoing threat to the efficiency, quality and equity of health services, especially in the public sector. Identifying effective interventions to manage dual practice is important. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of regulations implemented to manage dual practice.

Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, non‐randomized controlled trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted‐time‐series studies. Dual practice was defined as holding more than one job. Studies for inclusion were those focusing on interventions to manage dual practice among health professionals employed in the public health sector. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies when scanning the identified titles and abstracts. The same two review authors independently screened full reports of selected citations. At each stage, results were compared and discrepancies settled through discussion.
