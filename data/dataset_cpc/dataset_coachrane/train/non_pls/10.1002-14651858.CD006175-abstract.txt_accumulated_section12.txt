Background
In the past, progesterone has been advocated for prevention of pre‐eclampsia. Although progestogens were never widely used for this purpose in clinical practice, new hypothesis have emerged which suggest progesterone may have a role in promoting immunological tolerance between the fetus and mother, and may reduce risk of pre‐eclampsia. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of progesterone during pregnancy on risk of pre‐eclampsia and its complications. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2011) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (2 June 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating progesterone or other progestogen during pregnancy for prevention of pre‐eclampsia and its complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.
Main results
We included four trials of variable quality (1445 women). Three trials compared progesterone injections, and one compared progestogen vaginal gel, with no progesterone. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups on risk of pre‐eclampsia (three trials, 1277 women; risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.63), death of the baby (four trials, 2594 babies; RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.31), preterm birth (three trials, 1313 women; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10), small‐for‐gestational‐age babies (one trial, 168 women; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.57), major congenital defects (three trials, 2436 babies; one trial, no events, two trials RR 1.19 , 95% CI 0.31 to 4.52), or any other outcome reported. There were no reported cases of masculinisation of female babies (one trial, 128 women).
