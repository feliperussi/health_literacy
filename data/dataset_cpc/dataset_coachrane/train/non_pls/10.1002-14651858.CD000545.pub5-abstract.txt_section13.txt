There was possibly a modest difference in withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events between antimetabolites and placebo. Ten percent of patients in the antimetabolite group withdrew due to adverse events compared to 5% of placebo patients (8 studies, 510 patients; RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.08; moderate quality evidence). Serious adverse events were reported in 14% of patients receiving azathioprine compared to 4% of placebo patients (2 studies, 216 patients; RR 2.57, 95% CI 0.92 to 7.13; low quality evidence). Common adverse events reported in the placebo controlled studies included: allergic reactions. leukopenia, pancreatitis and nausea. Azathioprine was probably inferior to infliximab for induction of steroid‐free clinical remission. Thirty per cent (51/170) of azathioprine patients achieved steroid‐free remission compared to 44% (75/169) of infliximab patients (1 study, 339 patients; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90; moderate quality evidence). The combination of azathioprine and infliximab was probably superior to infliximab alone for induction of steroid‐free clinical remission. Sixty per cent (116/194) of patients in the combined azathioprine and infliximab group achieved steroid‐free remission compared to 48% (91/189) of infliximab patients (2 studies, 383 patients; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47; moderate quality evidence). Azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine therapy was found to be possibly superior at inducing steroid free clinical remission compared to methotrexate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49; low quality evidence) and the evidence was very uncertain as regards the comparison with 5‐aminosalicylate or sulfasalazine (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.91; very low quality evidence). The estimates for withdrawals due to adverse events between the various drugs were as follows: azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine versus methotrexate:RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.71; very low quality evidence; azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine versus 5‐aminosalicylate or sulfasalazine: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.54; low quality evidence; azathioprine versus infliximab: RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.23; moderate quality evidence and the combination of azathioprine and infliximab versus infliximab: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.80; moderate quality evidence. Common adverse events in the active comparator trials included nausea, abdominal pain, pyrexia and headache.
