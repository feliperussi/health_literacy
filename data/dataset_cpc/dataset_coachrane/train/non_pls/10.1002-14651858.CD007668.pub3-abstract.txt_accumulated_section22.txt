Background
Antisocial personality disorder (AsPD) is associated with poor mental health, criminality, substance use and relationship difficulties. This review updates Gibbon 2010 (previous version of the review). 
Objectives
To evaluate the potential benefits and adverse effects of psychological interventions for adults with AsPD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 13 other databases and two trials registers up to 5 September 2019. We also searched reference lists and contacted study authors to identify studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of adults, where participants with an AsPD or dissocial personality disorder diagnosis comprised at least 75% of the sample randomly allocated to receive a psychological intervention, treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), waiting list or no treatment. The primary outcomes were aggression, reconviction, global state/functioning, social functioning and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
This review includes 19 studies (eight new to this update), comparing a psychological intervention against TAU (also called 'standard Maintenance'(SM) in some studies). Eight of the 18 psychological interventions reported data on our primary outcomes. 
Four studies focussed exclusively on participants with AsPD, and 15 on subgroups of participants with AsPD. Data were available from only 10 studies involving 605 participants. 
Eight studies were conducted in the UK and North America, and one each in Iran, Denmark and the Netherlands. Study duration ranged from 4 to 156 weeks (median = 26 weeks). Most participants (75%) were male; the mean age was 35.5 years. Eleven studies (58%) were funded by research councils. Risk of bias was high for 13% of criteria, unclear for 54% and low for 33%. 
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) + TAUversus TAU 
One study (52 participants) found no evidence of a difference between CBT + TAU and TAU for physical aggression (odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.07; low‐certainty evidence) for outpatients at 12 months post‐intervention. 
One study (39 participants) found no evidence of a difference between CBT + TAU and TAU for social functioning (mean difference (MD) −1.60 points, 95% CI −5.21 to 2.01; very low‐certainty evidence), measured by the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ; range = 0‐24), for outpatients at 12 months post‐intervention. 
Impulsive lifestyle counselling (ILC) + TAU versus TAU 
One study (118 participants) found no evidence of a difference between ILC + TAU and TAU for trait aggression (assessed with Buss‐Perry Aggression Questionnaire‐Short Form) for outpatients at nine months (MD 0.07, CI −0.35 to 0.49; very low‐certainty evidence). 
One study (142 participants) found no evidence of a difference between ILC + TAU and TAU alone for the adverse event of death (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.04 to 4.54; very low‐certainty evidence) or incarceration (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.86; very low‐certainty evidence) for outpatients between three and nine months follow‐up. 
Contingency management (CM) + SM versus SM 
One study (83 participants) found evidence that, compared to SM alone, CM + SM may improve social functioning measured by family/social scores on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI; range = 0 (no problems) to 1 (severe problems); MD −0.08, 95% CI −0.14 to −0.02; low‐certainty evidence) for outpatients at six months.
