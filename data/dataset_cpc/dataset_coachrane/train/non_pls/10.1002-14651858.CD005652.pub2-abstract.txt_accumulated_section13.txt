Background
Psychotherapy is regarded as the first‐line treatment for people with borderline personality disorder. In recent years, several disorder‐specific interventions have been developed. This is an update of a review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in 2006 and it was superseded by a new review (with the same title) in the CDSR in 2020. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD). 
Search methods
We searched the following databases: CENTRAL 2010(3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010, week 39), ASSIA (1987 to November 2010), BIOSIS (1985 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (31 January 2011), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (15 October 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to October Week 1 2010), Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to October 2010), ZETOC (15 October 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (15 October 2010). In addition, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International in January 2011 and ICTRP in August 2011. 
Selection criteria
Randomised studies with samples of patients with BPD comparing a specific psychotherapeutic intervention against a control intervention without any specific mode of action or against a comparative specific psychotherapeutic intervention. Outcomes included overall BPD severity, BPD symptoms (DSM‐IV criteria), psychopathology associated with but not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. 
Main results
Twenty‐eight studies involving a total of 1804 participants with BPD were included. Interventions were classified as comprehensive psychotherapies if they included individual psychotherapy as a substantial part of the treatment programme, or as non‐comprehensive if they did not. 
Among comprehensive psychotherapies, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mentalisation‐based treatment in a partial hospitalisation setting (MBT‐PH), outpatient MBT (MBT‐out), transference‐focused therapy (TFP), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and interpersonal therapy for BPD (IPT‐BPD) were tested against a control condition. Direct comparisons of comprehensive psychotherapies included DBT versus client‐centered therapy (CCT); schema‐focused therapy (SFT) versus TFP; SFT versus SFT plus telephone availability of therapist in case of crisis (SFT+TA); cognitive therapy (CT) versus CCT, and CT versus IPT.
