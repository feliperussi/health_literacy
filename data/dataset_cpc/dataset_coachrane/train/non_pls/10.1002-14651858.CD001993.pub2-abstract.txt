Background
Incomplete miscarriage is a major problem that should be effectively managed with safe and appropriate procedures. Surgical evacuation of the uterus for management of incomplete miscarriage usually involves vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and effectiveness of surgical uterine evacuation methods for management of incomplete miscarriage. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2010).
Selection criteria
Randomized trials where different surgical methods were used to manage incomplete miscarriage were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted population characteristics, settings, and exclusion criteria, in addition to outcomes such as complications of the procedure, duration, need for re‐evacuation, blood transfusion, and analgesia/anesthesia. 
Main results
Two trials (involving 550 women) were included. Vacuum aspiration was associated with statistically significantly decreased blood loss (mean difference (MD) ‐17.10 ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐24.05 to ‐10.15 ml), less pain during the procedure (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90), and shorter duration of the procedure (MD ‐1.20 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.87 minutes), than sharp metal curettage, in the single study that evaluated these outcomes in 357 women. Serious complications such as uterine perforation and other morbidity were rare and the sample sizes of the trials were not large enough to evaluate small or moderate differences. 
Authors' conclusions
Although the review indicates that vacuum aspiration is safe, quick to perform, and less painful than sharp curettage, and should be recommended for use in the management of incomplete miscarriage, the results are based on data from only one study. Analgesia and sedation should be provided as necessary for the procedure.
