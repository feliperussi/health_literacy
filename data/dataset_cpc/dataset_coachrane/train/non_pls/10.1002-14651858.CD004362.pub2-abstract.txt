Background
The main objectives in treating mania are to control dangerous behaviour, reduce suicide, produce appropriate acute sedation and shorten the episode of mood disturbance. Among different drugs, haloperidol has for many years been used in treating psychotic patients, but it has a troublesome side effect profile. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of haloperidol for the treatment of mania in comparison with placebo or other active drugs, either as monotherapy or add‐on treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (11 October 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966‐2003), EMBASE (1980‐2003), CINAHL (1982‐2003), PsycINFO (1872‐2003) and reference lists. We also contacted experts, triallists and pharmaceutical companies in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing haloperidol with placebo or other active treatment in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials. 
Main results
Fifteen trials involving 2022 people were included. Compared to placebo, haloperidol was more effective at reducing manic symptoms, both as monotherapy (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) ‐5.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐7.69 to ‐4.00) and as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate (WMD ‐5.20, 95% CI ‐9.26 to ‐1.14). There was a statistically significant difference, with haloperidol being less effective than aripiprazole (Relative Risk (RR) 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73). No significant differences between haloperidol and risperidone, olanzapine, carbamazepine or valproate were found. Compared with placebo, a statistically significant difference in favour of haloperidol in failure to complete treatment (RR 0.74, 95% Cl 0.57 to 0.96) was reported. Haloperidol was associated with less weight gain than olanzapine (RR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67), but with a higher incidence of tremor (RR: 3.01, 95% CI 1.55 to 5.84) and other movement disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for acute mania. From the limited data available, there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone. Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole. Referring to tolerability, when considering the poor evidence comparing drugs, clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profiles as an important issue to inform their choice.
