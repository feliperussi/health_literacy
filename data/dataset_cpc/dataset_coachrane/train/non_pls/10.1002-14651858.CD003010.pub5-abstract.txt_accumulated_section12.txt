Background
Traction has been used to treat low‐back pain (LBP), often in combination with other treatments. We included both manual and machine‐delivered traction in this review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, and previously updated in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of traction compared to placebo, sham traction, reference treatments and no treatment in people with LBP. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (January 2006 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2012), CINAHL (January 2006 to August 2012), and reference lists of articles and personal files. The review authors are not aware of any important new randomized controlled trial (RCTs) on this topic since the date of the last search. 
Selection criteria
RCTs involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) non‐specific LBP with or without sciatica. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a descriptive analysis. We did not find any case series that identified adverse effects, therefore we evaluated adverse effects that were reported in the included studies. 
Main results
We included 32 RCTs involving 2762 participants in this review. We considered 16 trials, representing 57% of all participants, to have a low risk of bias based on the Cochrane Back Review Group's 'Risk of bias' tool.
