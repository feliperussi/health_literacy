Background
In experimental studies, the outcome of bacterial meningitis has been related to the severity of inflammation in the subarachnoid space. Corticosteroids reduce this inflammatory response. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy versus placebo on mortality, hearing loss and neurological sequelae in people of all ages with acute bacterial meningitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2015), Emabse (1974 to February 2015), Web of Science (2010 to February 2015), CINAHL (2010 to February 2015) and LILACS (2010 to February 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis.
Data collection and analysis
We scored RCTs for methodological quality. We collected outcomes and adverse effects. We performed subgroup analyses for children and adults, causative organisms, low‐income versus high‐income countries, time of steroid administration and study quality. 
Main results
We included 25 studies involving 4121 participants (2511 children and 1517 adults; 93 mixed population). Four studies were of high quality with no risk of bias, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, indicating a moderate risk of bias for the total analysis. Nine studies were performed in low‐income countries and 16 in high‐income countries. 
There was insufficient evidence that corticosteroids caused a reduction in mortality overall (17.8% versus 19.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.01; P = 0.07), or for adults (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.09). However they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88), any hearing loss (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) and neurological sequelae (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00). 
Subgroup analyses for causative organisms showed that corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) meningitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98), but not in Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) orNeisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) meningitis. Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H influenzae meningitis (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.59) but not in children with meningitis due to non‐Haemophilus species.
