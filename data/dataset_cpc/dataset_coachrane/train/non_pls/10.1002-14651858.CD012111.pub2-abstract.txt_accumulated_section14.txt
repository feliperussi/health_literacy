Background
Alvimopan is used in abdominal surgery to reduce postoperative ileus in patients undergoing small bowel resections with primary anastomosis. The role and efficacy of alvimopan in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is not well understood. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of alvimopan in the context of enhanced recovery pathways compared to enhanced recovery pathways alone for perioperative bowel dysfunction in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. 
Search methods
The terms alvimopan and cystectomy were used to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We also reviewed abstracts from the past four years (2013 to 2016) of the American Urologic Association, Society of Urologic Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared alvimopan to placebo.
Data collection and analysis
This study was based on a published protocol. We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases including CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and Biosis, which we last updated on 6 February 2017. We also searched abstract proceedings for major relevant meetings (2013 to 2016), databases of the grey literature, trial registries, citations of relevant reviews and contacted clinical experts and the drug manufacturer. 
Two independent reviewers screened the literature in two stages (title and abstract, full‐text) using Covidence software. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias on a 'per outcome' basis using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias; tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Results of the single eligible trial were reported in a 'Summary of findings' table based on an intention‐to‐treat analysis. 
Main results
Based on a single trial and moderate‐quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to reach a composite endpoint of tolerance of solid food and documented bowel movements (hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 2.23). This represents 165 more patients (109 more to 207 more) per 1000 meeting this endpoint within 10 days of surgery. Based on moderate‐quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to hospital discharge (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.01). This represents 138 more patients (82 more to 198 more) per 1000 being discharged within 10 days of surgery. Also based on moderate‐quality evidence, alvimopan was associated with a reduced risk of major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44) representing 355 fewer patients (404 fewer to 276 fewer) with major adverse events per 1000. We downgraded this outcome for indirectness as it included adverse events that we did not consider major. 
In terms of secondary outcomes, alvimopan did not appear to alter the rate of readmission (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33), change the rate of any cardiovascular event (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.05) or alter the mean narcotic pain medication use (mean difference 0, 95% CI 14.08 fewer to 14.08 more morphine equivalents). The quality of evidence was moderate for all three outcomes. Based on high‐quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the rate of nasogastric tube replacement (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59). We did not find evidence for the drug's impact on rates of parenteral nutrition. All outcomes were short term and limited to a 30‐day time horizon.
