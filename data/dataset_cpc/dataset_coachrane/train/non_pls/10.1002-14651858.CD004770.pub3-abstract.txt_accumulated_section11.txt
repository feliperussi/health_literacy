Background
Delirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute disturbance of attention and awareness which develops over a short time period and fluctuates in severity over the course of the day. It is commonly experienced during inpatient admission in the terminal phase of illness. It can cause symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations and is distressing for terminally ill people, their families and staff. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should aim to address these causes. When this is not possible, or treatment is unsuccessful, drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. 
This is the second update of the review first published in 2004.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies to manage delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019, reference lists of retrieved papers, and online trial registries. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of drug therapies in any dose by any route, compared to another drug therapy, a non‐pharmacological approach, placebo, standard care or wait‐list control, for the management of delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults (18 years or older). 
Data collection and analysis
We independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were delirium symptoms; agitation score; adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: use of rescue medication; cognitive status; survival. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome and we include eight 'Summary of findings' tables.
