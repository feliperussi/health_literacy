Background
Drowning is responsible for an estimated 320,000 deaths a year, and over 90% of drowning mortality occurs in low‐ to middle‐income countries (LMICs), with peak drowning rates among children aged 1 to 4 years. In this age group, mortality due to drowning is particularly common in rural settings and about 75% of drowning accidents happen in natural bodies of water close to the home. Providing adequate child supervision can protect children from drowning, and organized formal day care programs could offer a way to achieve this. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To assess the effects of day care programs for children under 6 years of age on drowning‐related mortality or morbidity, or on total drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal), in LMICs, compared to no day care programs or other drowning prevention interventions 
Secondary objectives 
• To assess the effects of day care programs in LMICs for children under 6 years of age on unsafe water exposure 
• To assess safety within these programs (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) 
• To assess the incidence of unintentional injury within these programs
• To describe the cost‐effectiveness of such programs, in relation to averted drowning‐related mortality or morbidity 
Search methods
On November 23, 2019, and for an update on August 18, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, ERIC, and CINAHL, as well as two trial registries. On December 16, 2019, and for an update on February 9, 2021, we searched 12 other resources, including websites of organizations that develop programs targeted to children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, quasi‐randomized, and non‐randomized controlled studies (with explicitly listed specific study design features) that implemented formal day care programs as a single program or combined with additional out‐of‐day care components (such as educational activities aimed at preventing injury or drowning or early childhood development activities) for children of preschool age (below 6 years of age) in LMICs for comparison with no such programs or with other drowning prevention interventions. Studies had to report at least one outcome related to drowning or injury prevention for the children enrolled.
