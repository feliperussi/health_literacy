Background
Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve due to viral infection by the herpes zoster virus are implicated in the aetiology and clinical manifestation of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy). Corticosteroids, with their powerful anti‚Äêinflammatory effect, have a potential role to play in the reduction or minimisation of nerve damage when administered together with antiviral therapy, and therefore may improve the outcome for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral therapy in adult patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2007), LILACS, KoreaMed, IndMed, PakMediNet, ZETOC, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (Conference Proceedings Database), ISI Proceedings (Web of Science), the National Research Register (NRR), the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database (UKCRN), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Research Findings Register (ReFeR) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials in which corticosteroids (by any route of administration at any dosage) were given as an adjuvant to antiviral agents in the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality of the available studies, whether they were published or unpublished. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed.
