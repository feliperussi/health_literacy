The review includes 31 trials with 12,579 participants. Of 24 comparisons made, 6 compared a COC to placebo, 17 different COCs, and 1 compared a COC to an antibiotic. Of nine placebo‐controlled trials with data for analysis, all showed COCs reduced acne lesion counts, severity grades and self‐assessed acne compared to placebo. A levonorgestrel‐COC group had fewer total lesion counts (MD ‐9.98; 95% CI ‐16.51 to ‐3.45), inflammatory and non‐inflammatory lesion counts, and were more likely to have a clinician assessment of clear or almost clear lesions and participant self‐assessment of improved acne lesions. A norethindrone acetate COC had better results for clinician global assessment of no acne to mild acne (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.62). In two combined trials, a norgestimate COC showed reduced total lesion counts (MD‐9.32; 95% CI ‐14.19 to ‐4.45), reduced inflammatory lesion and comedones counts, and more with clinician assessment of improved acne. For two combined trials of a drospirenone COC, the investigators' assessment of clear or almost clear skin favored the drospirenone group (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.99 to 4.59). In one trial, the drospirenone‐COC group showed greater (more positive) percent changes for total lesion count (MD 29.08; 95% CI 3.13 to 55.03), inflammatory and non‐inflammatory lesion counts, and papule and closed comedone counts. A dienogest‐COC group had greater percentage decreases in total lesion count (MD ‐15.30; 95% CI ‐19.98 to ‐10.62) and inflammatory lesion count, and more women assessed with overall improvement of facial acne. A CMA‐COC group had more 'responders,' those with 50% or greater decrease in facial papules and pustules (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.55)
