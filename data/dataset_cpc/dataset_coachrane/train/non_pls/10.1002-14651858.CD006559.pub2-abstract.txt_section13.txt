The largest median effect on rates of VAP was found at nine months follow‐up with a decrease of 7.36 (‐10.82 to 3.14) cases per 1000 ventilator days (five studies and 15 sites). The one included cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) observed, improved urinary catheter practices five weeks after the intervention (absolute difference 12.2 percentage points), however, the statistical significance of this is unknown given a unit of analysis error. It is worth noting that N = 6 interventions that did result in significantly decreased infection rates involved more than one active intervention, which in some cases, was repeatedly administered over time, and further, that one intervention involving specialised oral care personnel showed the largest step change (‐22.9 cases per 1000 ventilator days (standard error (SE) 4.0), and also the largest slope change (‐6.45 cases per 1000 ventilator days (SE 1.42, P = 0.002)) among the included studies. We attempted to combine the results for studies targeting the same indwelling medical device (central line catheters or mechanical ventilators) and reporting the same outcomes (CLABSI and VAP rate) in two separate meta‐analyses, but due to very high statistical heterogeneity among included studies (I2 up to 97%), we did not retain these analyses. Six of the included studies reported post‐intervention adherence scores ranging from 14% to 98%. The effect on rates of infection were mixed and the effect sizes were small, with the largest median effect for the change in level (interquartile range (IQR)) for the six CLABSI studies being observed at three months follow‐up was a decrease of 0.6 (‐2.74 to 0.28) cases per 1000 central line days (six studies and 36 sites). This change was not sustained over longer follow‐up times.
