Background
Childhood obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a disorder that is characterised by repeated episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction (UAO) during sleep that result in disruption of normal ventilation and sleep patterns. Chronic cough in children is a significant medical problem and in some situations warrants thorough investigation. There may be an association between chronic cough and OSA as suggested in adult studies. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of treatment of OSA leading to the resolution of cough in the management of children with chronic cough. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE. The latest search was performed in September 2010. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention for OSA to a control group (placebo or usual treatment) in children with chronic cough. 
Data collection and analysis
We reviewed the search results against the pre‚Äêdetermined criteria for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected the studies. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of treatment of OSA in the management of children with chronic cough. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence that therapies directed for OSA are useful for the management of chronic cough in children. Until further evidence is available, OSA should be managed on its own merits and the presence or absence of cough should not be used as a decision trigger. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed.
