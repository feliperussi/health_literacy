Background
Pressure ulcers have been recorded as occurring in 5 to 32% of patients admitted to a UK District General Hospital (the precise rate depends on case‐mix) and 4 to 7% in the community. They represent a major burden of sickness and reduced quality of life for patients and their carers, and are costly to health service providers. 
Pressure ulcers are treated by using wound dressings, relieving pressure on the wound, by treating concurrent conditions which may delay healing, and by the use of physical therapies such as electrical stimulation, laser therapy and ultrasound. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of therapeutic ultrasound on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (April 2008) , The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ‐ The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2008, Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 3 2008), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 16) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to April Week 3 2008). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapeutic ultrasound with sham ultrasound or standard treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently checked the result of the search to identify relevant RCTs. Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction sheet. Attempts were made to obtain missing information by contacting authors. Data extraction was checked by a second author. Meta‐analysis was used to combine the results of trials where the interventions and outcome measures were sufficiently similar. 
Main results
Three trials involving 146 people were included. Two RCTs compared ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound and the third compared a combination of ultrasound and ultraviolet light with laser and with standard treatment.
