Background
Impaired placentation can cause some of the most important obstetrical complications such as pre‐eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction and has been linked to increased fetal morbidity and mortality. The failure to undergo physiological trophoblastic vascular changes is reflected by the high impedance to the blood flow at the level of the uterine arteries. Doppler ultrasound study of utero‐placental blood vessels, using waveform indices or notching, may help to identify the 'at‐risk' women in the first and second trimester of pregnancy, such that interventions might be used to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and/or mortality. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on pregnancy outcome, and obstetric practice, of routine utero‐placental Doppler ultrasound in first and second trimester of pregnancy in pregnant women at high and low risk of hypertensive complications. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2010) and the reference lists of identified studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of Doppler ultrasound for the investigation of utero‐placental vessel waveforms in first and second trimester compared with no Doppler ultrasound. We have excluded studies where uterine vessels have been assessed together with fetal and umbilical vessels. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. We checked data entry. 
Main results
We found two studies involving 4993 participants. The methodological quality of the trials was good. Both studies included women at low risk for hypertensive disorders, with Doppler ultrasound of the uterine arteries performed in the second trimester of pregnancy. In both studies, pathological finding of uterine arteries was followed by low‐dose aspirin administration.
