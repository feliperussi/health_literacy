Background
Worldwide, caesarean section is the most common major operation performed on women. Some of the reported short‐term morbidities include haemorrhage, postoperative fever and endometritis. The method of delivering the placenta is one procedure that may contribute to an increase or decrease in the morbidity of caesarean section. Two common methods used to deliver the placenta at caesarean section are cord traction and manual removal. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of manual removal of the placenta with cord traction at caesarean section. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2007). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials comparing manual removal and cord traction or spontaneous of delivery of the placenta. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies and extracted data.
Main results
We included 15 studies (4694 women). There was significant heterogeneity for the duration of surgery, blood loss and haematological outcomes. The only possible contributing factor found was greater protection from blood loss in two trials in which cord traction was combined with uterine massage. A random‐effects model meta‐analysis was used for these outcomes. 
Manual removal of the placenta was associated with more endometritis (relative risk (RR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 1.90; 4134 women, 13 trials); more blood loss (ml) (weighted mean difference (WMD) 94.42 ml, 95% CI 17.19 to 171.64; 2001 women, eight trials); more blood loss > 1000 ml (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.28; 872 women, two trials); lower haematocrit after delivery (%) (WMD ‐1.55, 95% CI ‐3.09 to ‐0.01; 384 women, two trials); greater haematocrit fall after delivery (%) (WMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.78; 1777 women, five trials); longer duration of hospital stay (days) (WMD 0.39 days, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.61; 546 women, three trials).  The duration of surgery was shorter in one trial but not overall.
