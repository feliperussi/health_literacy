Background
Rates of injury and death caused by car crashes with teenage drivers remain high in most high‐income countries. In addition to injury and death, car use includes other non‐traffic risks; these may be health‐related, such as physical inactivity or respiratory disease caused by air pollution, or have global significance, such as the environmental impact of car use. Research demonstrates that reducing the amount of time driving reduces the risk of injury, and it is expected that it would also reduce other risks that are unrelated to traffic. Mobility management interventions aim to increase mobility awareness and encourage a shift from private car use to active (walking, cycling, skateboarding), and public (bus, tram, train), transportation. 'Soft' mobility management interventions include the application of strategies and policies to reduce travel demand and may be instigated locally or more widely, to target a specific or a non‐specific population group; 'hard' mobility management interventions include changes to the built environment or transport infrastructure and are not the focus of this review. 
Between the ages of 15 to 19 years, young people enter a development stage known as the 'transition teens' in which they are likely to make long‐lasting lifestyle changes. It is possible that using this specific time point to introduce mobility management interventions may influence a person's long‐term mobility behaviour. 
Objectives
To assess whether 'soft' mobility management interventions prevent, reduce, or delay car driving in teenagers aged 15 to 19 years, and to assess whether these mobility management interventions also reduce crashes caused by teenage drivers.
