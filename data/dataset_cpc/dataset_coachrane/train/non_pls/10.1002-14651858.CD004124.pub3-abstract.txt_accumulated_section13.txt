Background
Chronic lateral ankle instability occurs in 10% to 20% of people after an acute ankle sprain. Initial treatment is conservative but if this fails and ligament laxity is present, surgical intervention is considered. 
Objectives
To compare different treatments, conservative or surgical, for chronic lateral ankle instability. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, all to February 2010. 
Selection criteria
All identified randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of interventions for chronic lateral ankle instability were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were included. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials resulted in unclear or high risk of bias assessments relating to allocation concealment, assessor blinding, incomplete and selective outcome reporting. Only limited pooling of the data was possible. 
Neuromuscular training was the basis of conservative treatment evaluated in four trials. Neuromuscular training compared with no training resulted in better ankle function scores at the end of four weeks training (Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT): mean difference (MD) 3.00, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.70; 1 trial, 19 participants; Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) data: MD 8.83, 95% CI 4.46 to 13.20; 2 trials, 56 participants). The fourth trial (19 participants) found no significant difference in the functional outcome after six weeks training programme on a cyclo‐ergometer with a bi‐directional compared with a traditional uni‐directional pedal. Longer‐term follow‐up data were not available for these four trials.
