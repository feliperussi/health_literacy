It is uncertain whether pharmaceutical care improves medication appropriateness (as measured by an implicit tool), mean difference (MD) ‐4.76, 95% CI ‐9.20 to ‐0.33; 5 studies, N = 517; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether pharmaceutical care reduces the number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.05; 7 studies; N = 1832; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether pharmaceutical care reduces the proportion of patients with one or more PIMs, (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02; 11 studies; N = 3079; very low‐certainty evidence). Pharmaceutical care may slightly reduce the number of potential prescribing omissions (PPOs) (SMD ‐0.81, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.64; 2 studies; N = 569; low‐certainty evidence), however it must be noted that this effect estimate is based on only two studies, which had serious limitations in terms of risk bias. Likewise, it is uncertain whether pharmaceutical care reduces the proportion of patients with one or more PPOs (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.85; 5 studies; N = 1310; very low‐certainty evidence). Pharmaceutical care may make little or no difference in hospital admissions (data not pooled; 12 studies; N = 4052; low‐certainty evidence). Pharmaceutical care may make little or no difference in quality of life (data not pooled; 12 studies; N = 3211; low‐certainty evidence). Medication‐related problems were reported in eight studies (N = 10,087) using different terms (e.g. adverse drug reactions, drug‐drug interactions). No consistent intervention effect on medication‐related problems was noted across studies.
