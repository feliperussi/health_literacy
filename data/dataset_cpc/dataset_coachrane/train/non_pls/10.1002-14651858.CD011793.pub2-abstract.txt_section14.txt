There was no evidence of an effect on length of hospital stay through limited hemi‐sternotomy (MD ‐1.31 days, 95% CI ‐2.63 to 0.01; participants = 297; studies = 5; I2 = 89%; very low quality). Postoperative blood loss was lower in the upper hemi‐sternotomy group (MD ‐158.00 mL, 95% CI ‐303.24 to ‐12.76; participants = 297; studies = 5; moderate quality). The evidence did not support a reduction in deep sternal wound infections (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.30; participants = 511; studies = 7; moderate quality) or re‐exploration (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.13; participants = 511; studies = 7; moderate quality). There was no change in pain scores by upper hemi‐sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.85 to 0.20; participants = 197; studies = 3; I2 = 70%; very low quality), but there was a small increase in postoperative pulmonary function tests with minimally invasive limited sternotomy (MD 1.98 % predicted FEV1, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.33; participants = 257; studies = 4; I2 = 28%; low quality). There was a small reduction in length of intensive care unit stays as a result of the minimally invasive upper hemi‐sternotomy (MD ‐0.57 days, 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.20; participants = 297; studies = 5; low quality). Postoperative atrial fibrillation was not reduced with minimally invasive aortic valve replacement through limited compared to full sternotomy (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.89; participants = 240; studies = 3; moderate quality), neither were postoperative ventilation times (MD ‐1.12 hours, 95% CI ‐3.43 to 1.19; participants = 297; studies = 5; low quality). None of the included studies reported cost analyses.
