Background
Malaria in pregnancy is associated with adverse consequences for mother and fetus. Protection with insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) during pregnancy is widely advocated, but evidence of their benefit has been inconsistent. 
Objectives
To compare the impact of ITNs with no nets or untreated nets on preventing malaria in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (February 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2009), EMBASE (1974 to February 2009), LILACS (1982 to February 2009), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers working in the field. 
Selection criteria
Individual and cluster randomized controlled trials of ITNs in pregnant women.
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the trials and extracted data. Data were combined using the generic inverse variance method. 
Main results
Six randomized controlled trials were identified, five of which met the inclusion criteria: four trials from sub‐Saharan Africa compared ITNs with no nets, and one trial from Asia compared ITNs with untreated nets. Two trials randomized individual women and three trials randomized communities. In Africa, ITNs, compared with no nets, reduced placental malaria in all pregnancies (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.98). They also reduced low birthweight (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98) and fetal loss in the first to fourth pregnancy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97), but not in women with more than four previous pregnancies. For anaemia and clinical malaria, results tended to favour ITNs, but the effects were not significant. In Thailand, one trial randomizing individuals to ITNs or untreated nets showed a significant reduction in anaemia and fetal loss in all pregnancies but not for clinical malaria or low birthweight.
