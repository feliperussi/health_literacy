Background
Oral analgesia is a convenient and widely used form of pain relief following caesarean section. It includes various medications used at different doses alone or in adjunction to other form of analgesia. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of oral analgesia for post‐caesarean pain relief. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi‐randomised and cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Interventions included oral medication given to women for post‐caesarean pain relief compared with oral medication, or placebo/no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies and independently assessed trial quality, extracted the data using the agreed data extraction form, and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Eight small trials involving 962 women (out of 13 included trials) contributed data to the analysis, of which only four trials had low risk of bias. 
None of the included studies reported on 'adequate pain relief', which is one of this review's primary outcomes. 
1. Opiod analgesics versus placebo 
Based on one trial involving 120 women, the effect of opioids versus placebo was not significant in relation to the need for additional pain relief (primary outcome) (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 1.92), and the effect in terms of adverse drug effects outcomes was also uncertain (RR 6.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 113.96). 
Low (75 mg) and high (150 mg) doses of tramadol had a similar effect on the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.78 and RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.68, respectively, one study, 80 women). 
2. Non‐opioid analgesia versus placebo 
The confidence interval for the lower requirement for additional analgesia (primary outcome) with the non‐opioid analgesia group was wide and includes little or no effect (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.01, six studies, 584 women). However, we observed substantial heterogeneity due to the variety of non‐opioid drugs used (I2 = 85%). In a subgroup analysis of different drugs, only gabapentin use resulted in less need for additional pain relief (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.51, one trial, 126 women). There was no difference in need for additional pain relief with the use of celexocib, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, paracetamol. Maternal drug effects were more common with the use of non‐opioid analgesics (RR 11.12, 95% CI 2.13 to 58.22, two trials, 267 women).
