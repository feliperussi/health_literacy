Background
Ankle fractures, which usually occur after a twisting incident, are a diverse collection of injuries with different levels of complexity and severity. They have an incidence of 1 in 1000 a year in children. Treatment generally involves splints and casts for minor fractures and surgical fixation with screws, plates and pins followed by immobilisation for more serious fractures. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different interventions for treating ankle fractures in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (22 September 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 2 2015), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (21 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2015 Week 38), CINAHL (1937 to 22 September 2015), trial registers (17 February 2015), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for treating ankle fractures in children. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full articles for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and collected data. We undertook no meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included three randomised controlled trials reporting results for 189 children, all of whom had a clinical diagnosis of a "low risk" ankle fracture. These were predominantly classified as undisplaced Salter‐Harris type I fractures of the distal fibula. All three trials compared non‐surgical management options. The three trials were at high risk of bias, primarily relating to the impracticality of blinding participants and treating clinicians to the allocated interventions.
