Background
This is an updated merged review of two originally separate Cochrane reviews: one on robot‐assisted surgery (RAS) for benign gynaecological disease, the other on RAS for gynaecological cancer. RAS is a relatively new innovation in laparoscopic surgery that enables the surgeon to conduct the operation from a computer console, situated away from the surgical table. RAS is already widely used in the United States for hysterectomy and has been shown to be feasible for other gynaecological procedures. However, the clinical effectiveness and safety of RAS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) have not been clearly established and require independent review. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of RAS in the treatment of women with benign and malignant gynaecological disease. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, and EMBASE via Ovid, on 8 January 2018. We searched www.ClinicalTrials.gov. on 16 January 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RAS versus CLS or open surgery in women requiring surgery for gynaecological disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted study data and entered them into an Excel spreadsheet. We examined different procedures in separate comparisons and for hysterectomy subgrouped data according to type of disease (non‐malignant versus malignant). When more than one study contributed data, we pooled data using random‐effects methods in RevMan 5.3. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 1016 women. Studies were at moderate to high overall risk of bias, and we downgraded evidence mainly due to concerns about risk of bias in the studies contributing data and imprecision of effect estimates. Procedures performed were hysterectomy (eight studies) and sacrocolpopexy (three studies). In addition, one trial examined surgical treatment for endometriosis, which included resection or hysterectomy. Among studies of women undergoing hysterectomy procedures, two studies involved malignant disease (endometrial cancer); the rest involved non‐malignant disease. 
• RAS versus CLS (hysterectomy)
Low‐certainty evidence suggests there might be little or no difference in any complication rates between RAS and CLS (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.59; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 51%), intraoperative complication rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.56; participants = 487; studies = 5; I² = 28%), postoperative complications (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.59; participants = 533; studies = 5; I2 = 51%), and blood transfusions (RR 2.49, 95% CI 0.75 to 8.23; participants = 346; studies = 4; I2 = 0%)). There was no statistical difference between malignant and non‐malignant disease subgroups with regard to complication rates. Survival outcomes for women with malignant disease were not reported. 
Mean total operating time was longer on average in the RAS arm than in the CLS arm (mean difference (MD) 41.18 minutes, 95% CI ‐6.17 to 88.53; participants = 148; studies = 2; I² = 80%; very low‐certainty evidence), and the mean length of hospital stay was slightly shorter with RAS than with CLS (MD ‐0.30 days, 95% CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.07; participants = 192; studies = 2; I² = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence).
