Background
Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Cyclo‐oxygenase (COX) inhibitors inhibit uterine contractions, are easily administered and appear to have few maternal side effects. However, adverse effects have been reported in the fetus and newborn as a result of exposure to COX inhibitors. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes of COX inhibitors administered as a tocolytic agent to women in preterm labour when compared with (i) placebo or no intervention and (ii) other tocolytics. In addition, to compare the effects of non‐selective COX inhibitors with COX‐2 selective inhibitors. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (24 August 2014). We also contacted recognised experts and searched reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomised trials in which COX inhibitors were used for tocolysis for women in labour between 20 and 36 completed weeks' gestation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data. We sought additional information from study authors. Results are presented using risk ratio (RR; dichotomous data) and mean difference (MD; continuous data) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for harm (NNTH) were calculated for statistically different categorical outcomes. 
Main results
With the addition of seven studies with a total of 684 women, this review now includes outcome data from 20 studies including 1509 women. The non‐selective COX inhibitor indomethacin was used in 15 studies. The overall quality of the included studies was considered moderate to low.
