Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline significantly reduced serum creatinine (SCr) (MD ‐0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.17 to ‐0.03), albuminuria (SMD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐3.85 to ‐0.70) and overt proteinuria (MD ‐428.58 µg/min, 95% CI ‐661.65 to ‐195.50), but there was no difference in creatinine clearance (CrCl) (MD ‐5.18 mL/min, 95% CI ‐15.55 to 5.19). When compared with routine treatment alone, pentoxifylline did not significantly reduce SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.07) or blood pressure (systolic (SBP): MD ‐0.28 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐2.20 to 1.63; diastolic (DBP): MD ‐0.15 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐1.44 to 1.14), but did significantly reduce albuminuria (SMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.07) and proteinuria (MD 0.46 g/24 h, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.74). There was no significant difference in SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.08 to 0.07), albuminuria (MD ‐8.79 µg/min, 95% CI ‐27.18 to 9.59), proteinuria (MD ‐0.01 g/24 h, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01) or blood pressure (SBP: MD 1.46 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 3.50; DBP: MD 1.37 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 2.98) between pentoxifylline and the active comparator (captopril or clonidine/methyldopa) for patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. CrCl was significantly increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa (MD 10.90 mL/min, 95% CI ‐1.40 to 20.40) but not with captopril (MD 3.26 mL/min, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 7.59). No data were available on the incidence of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), time to ESKD, quality of life, or all‐cause mortality. The adverse events of pentoxifylline were mild; no serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.
