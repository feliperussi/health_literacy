Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by episodes of disease activity and symptom‐free remission. Probiotics are microorganisms that can potentially benefit health, and have been evaluated as an alternate means of preventing relapse in patients with CD. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of probiotics for the maintenance of remission in CD.
Search methods
The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005, Issue 3); the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Trials Register (2005), MEDLINE (1966 ‐ 2005); EMBASE (1980 ‐ 2005); ISI Web of Knowledge (BIDS) 1981 ‐ 2005; On‐line clinical trials databases (2005); and review articles. Experts in the field were contacted for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of probiotic therapy.
Data collection and analysis
Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. The primary outcome was the relative risk (RR) of relapse after maintenance treatment (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]). 
Main results
Seven small studies were identified and varied according to probiotics tested, methodological quality and medication regimen. No studies were pooled for statistical analysis. 
There was no statistically significant benefit of E. coli Nissle for reducing the risk of relapse compared to placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.20), or Lactobacillus GG after surgically‐induced remission (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 8.40) or medically‐induced remission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80). 
There was no statistically significant benefit of probiotics for reducing the risk of relapse compared to maintenance therapy employing aminosalicylates or azathioprine (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.30), and in this study the probiotic Lactobacillus GG was associated with adverse events.
