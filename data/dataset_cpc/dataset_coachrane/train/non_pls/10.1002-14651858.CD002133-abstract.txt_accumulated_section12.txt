Background
A two to four week course of ticlopidine plus aspirin following coronary stenting is considered effective in preventing thrombotic occlusion of the stented vessel and safe in regards to bleeding and peripheral vascular complications. However, rare, although potentially life‐threatening haematological complications have been reported with this drug regimen. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticlopidine plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulants after coronary stenting 
Search methods
Electronic search of the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase from 1991 to June 1999; references from trials and experts. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing ticlopidine plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulants (either with or without aspirin) after elective or bail out coronary stenting. 
Data collection and analysis
Three reviewers assessed trial quality and compiled data on outcomes including: total mortality, non fatal myocardial infarction and revascularization occurring within the first 30 days after hospitalization, stent thrombosis on angiography, major and minor bleeding, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Main results
Four trials (n = 2436 patients) were included. Ticlopidine plus aspirin compared to oral anticoagulants significantly reduced the risk of non‐fatal acute myocardial infarction and revascularization at 30 days, combined negative events (mortality, myocardial infarction, revascularization at 30 days) (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.69; NNT for 30 days: 22; 95% CI: 14 to 45), and major bleeding (RR in high quality studies: 0.24 ; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.79). Ticlopidine plus aspirin compared to oral anticoagulants significantly increased the risk of eutropenia,thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (RR 5; 95% CI: 1.08 to 13.07; NNT for 30 days: 142; 95% CI: 76 to 1000). Ticlopidine plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation did not affect all cause mortality. Ticlopidine plus aspirin significantly reduced the risk of stent thrombosis (angiography) which was seen only on studies with blinded outcome assessment (RR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.60; NNT for 30 days: 33; 95% CI:16 to 166). Minor bleeding was reported only in one study and no studies recorded thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
