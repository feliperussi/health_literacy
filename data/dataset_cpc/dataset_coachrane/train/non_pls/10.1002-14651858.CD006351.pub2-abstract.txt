Background
Impaction grafting is a technique to restore bone loss both in the femur and the acetabulum during revision hip arthroplasty surgery. Initially impaction grafting was undertaken using fresh frozen femoral head allografts that were milled to create morselized bone pieces that could be impacted to create a neo‐cancellous bone bed prior to cementation of the new implant. Results of medium and long term outcome studies have shown variable results using this technique. Currently both processed and non‐processed allograft bone are used and the purpose of this review was to analyse the evidence for both. 
Objectives
To determine the clinical effectiveness of processed (freeze dried or irradiated) bone in comparison to fresh frozen (unprocessed) bone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1985 to 2008), EMBASE (1985 to 2008), CINAHL(1985 to 2008) and the National Research Register. Additional sources were also searched. Handsearching of relevant journals and conference abstracts was also undertaken. Searches were complete to 31 August 2008. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared different types of bone for impaction grafting.
Data collection and analysis
Three hundred and sixty references were identified from the searches. Following detailed eligibility screening, three hundred and fifty nine references did not meet the eligibility criteria. Further details are required about one trial in order to determine it's eligibility. 
Main results
No trials were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the review.
Authors' conclusions
Good quality randomised controlled trials are required in this area so that a surgeon’s choice of bone graft can be informed by evidence rather than personal preference.
