We included 11 trials with 699 participants. Ten trials provided data for analysis. Trials varied in the numbers and types of participants included and in the types of surgery performed. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias because of inappropriate or unclear randomization procedures, and because blinding of assessors and participants generally was not possible. This may have influenced results, but it is unclear how the results may have been influenced. Active warming was found to reduce the mean time taken to achieve normothermia by about 30 minutes in comparison with use of warmed cotton blankets (mean difference (MD) ‐32.13 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐42.55 to ‐21.71; moderate‐quality evidence), but no significant difference in shivering was noted. Active warming was found to reduce mean time taken to achieve normothermia by almost an hour and a half in comparison with use of unwarmed cotton blankets (MD ‐88.86 minutes, 95% CI ‐123.49 to ‐54.23; moderate‐quality evidence), and people in the active warming group were less likely to shiver than those in the unwarmed cotton blanket group (Relative Risk=0.61 95% CI= 0.42 to 0.86; low quality evidence). There was no effect on mean temperature difference in degrees celsius at 60 minutes (MD=0.18°C, 95% CI=‐0.10 to 0.46; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available in relation to major cardiovascular complications. Forced air warming was found to reduce time taken to achieve normothermia by about one hour in comparison to circulating hot water devices (MD=‐54.21 minutes 95% CI= ‐94.95, ‐13.47). There was no statistically significant difference between thermal insulation and cotton blankets on mean time to achieve normothermia (MD =‐0.29 minutes, 95% CI=‐25.47 to 24.89; moderate quality evidence) or shivering (Relative Risk=1.36 95% CI= 0.69 to 2.67; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available for mean temperature difference or major cardiovascular complications. Insufficient evidence was available about other comparisons, adverse effects or any other secondary outcomes.
