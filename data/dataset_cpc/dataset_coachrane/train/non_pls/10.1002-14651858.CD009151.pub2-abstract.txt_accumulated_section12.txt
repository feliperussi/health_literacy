Background
Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. 
Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non‐drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes: 
• number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);• proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow‐up period; and• adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed‐effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I2 > 70%) or used a random‐effects model (I2 40‐70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.
