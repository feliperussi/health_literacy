Background
In order to minimise publication bias, authors of systematic reviews often spend considerable time trying to obtain unpublished data. These include data from studies conducted but not published (unpublished data), as either an abstract or full‐text paper, as well as missing data (data available to original researchers but not reported) in published abstracts or full‐text publications. The effectiveness of different methods used to obtain unpublished or missing data has not been systematically evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different methods for obtaining unpublished studies (data) and missing data from studies to be included in systematic reviews. 
Search methods
We identified primary studies comparing different methods of obtaining unpublished studies (data) or missing data by searching the Cochrane Methodology Register (Issue 1, 2010), MEDLINE and EMBASE (1980 to 28 April 2010). We also checked references in relevant reports and contacted researchers who were known or who were thought likely to have carried out relevant studies. We used the Science Citation Index and PubMed 'related articles' feature to identify any additional studies identified by other sources (19 June 2009). 
Selection criteria
Primary studies comparing different methods of obtaining unpublished studies (data) or missing data in the healthcare setting. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of unpublished studies (data) or missing data obtained, as defined and reported by the authors of the included studies. Two authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using a standardised data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.
