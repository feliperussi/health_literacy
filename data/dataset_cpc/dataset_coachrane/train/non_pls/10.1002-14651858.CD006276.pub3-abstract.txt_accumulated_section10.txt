Background
Cancer‐related pain is complex and multi‐dimensional but the mainstay of cancer pain management has predominantly used a biomedical approach. There is a need for non‐pharmacological and innovative approaches. Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) may have a role in pain management but the effectiveness of TENS is currently unknown. This is an update of the original review published in Issue 3, 2008. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of TENS for cancer‐related pain in adults. 
Search methods
The initial review searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED and PEDRO databases in April 2008. We performed an updated search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDRO databases in November 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTS) investigating the use of TENS for the management of cancer‐related pain in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
The search strategy identified a further two studies for possible inclusion. One of the review authors screened each abstract using a study eligibility tool. Where eligibility could not be determined, a second author assessed the full paper. One author used a standardised data extraction sheet to collect information on the studies and independently assess the quality of the studies using the validated five‐point Oxford Quality Scale. The small sample sizes and differences in patient study populations of the three included studies (two from the original review and a third included in this update) prevented meta‐analysis. For the original review the search strategy identified 37 possible published studies; we divided these between two pairs of review authors who decided on study selection; all four review authors discussed and agreed final scores.
