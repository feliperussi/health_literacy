Background
Sitting can be viewed as a therapeutic intervention and an important part of a person's recovery process; but the risk of ulceration must be mitigated. Interventions for ulcer prevention in those at risk from prolonged sitting include the use of specialist cushions and surfaces, especially for wheelchair users. Whilst there is interest in the effects of different pressure redistributing cushions for wheelchairs, the benefits of pressure redistributing static chairs, compared with standard chairs, for pressure ulcer development in at‐risk people are not clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pressure redistributing static chairs on the prevention of pressure ulcers in health, rehabilitation and social care settings, and places of residence in which people may spend their day. 
Search methods
In June 2021 we searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of relevant randomised clinical trials: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). We also searched clinical trials registers for ongoing and unpublished studies, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We sought to include published or unpublished randomised controlled trials that assessed pressure redistributing static chairs in the prevention or management of pressure ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection. We planned that two review authors would also assess the risk of bias, extract study data and assess the certainty of evidence according to GRADE methodology.
