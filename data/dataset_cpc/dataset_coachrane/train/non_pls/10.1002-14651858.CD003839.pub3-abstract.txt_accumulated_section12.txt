Background
The introduction of point‐of‐care devices for the management of patients on oral anticoagulation allows self‐testing by the patient at home. Patients who self‐test can either adjust their medication according to a pre‐determined dose‐INR (international normalized ratio) schedule (self‐management), or they can call a clinic to be told the appropriate dose adjustment (self‐monitoring). Increasing evidence suggests self‐testing of oral anticoagulant therapy is equal to or better than standard monitoring. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2010. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects on thrombotic events, major haemorrhages, and all‐cause mortality of self‐monitoring or self‐management of oral anticoagulant therapy compared to standard monitoring. 
Search methods
For this review update, we re‐ran the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2015, Issue 6, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June week 4 2015), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2015 week 27) on 1 July 2015. We checked bibliographies and contacted manufacturers and authors of relevant studies. We did not apply any language restrictions . 
Selection criteria
Outcomes analysed were thromboembolic events, mortality, major haemorrhage, minor haemorrhage, tests in therapeutic range, frequency of testing, and feasibility of self‐monitoring and self‐management. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently extracted data and we used a fixed‐effect model with the Mantzel‐Haenzel method to calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) and Peto’s method to verify the results for uncommon outcomes. We examined heterogeneity amongst studies with the Chi2 and I2 statistics and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We identified 28 randomised trials including 8950 participants (newly incorporated in this update: 10 trials including 4227 participants). The overall quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. Pooled estimates showed a reduction in thromboembolic events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; participants = 7594; studies = 18; moderate quality of evidence). Both, trials of self‐management or self‐monitoring showed reductions in thromboembolic events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70; participants = 3497; studies = 11) and (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; participants = 4097; studies = 7), respectively; the quality of evidence for both interventions was moderate. No reduction in all‐cause mortality was found (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; participants = 6358; studies = 11; moderate quality of evidence). While self‐management caused a reduction in all‐cause mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84; participants = 3058; studies = 8); self‐monitoring did not (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; participants = 3300; studies = 3); the quality of evidence for both interventions was moderate. In 20 trials (8018 participants) self‐monitoring or self‐management did not reduce major haemorrhage (RR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.12; moderate quality of evidence). There was no significant difference found for minor haemorrhage (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.41; participants = 5365; studies = 13). The quality of evidence was graded as low because of serious risk of bias and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82%).
