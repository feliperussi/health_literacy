Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. 
Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD. 
Search methods
In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non‐serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel‐group trials and first period data from cross‐over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post‐cross‐over data from cross‐over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias. 
Main results
The studies. We included 38 parallel‐group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross‐over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys‐to‐girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high‐income countries. 
The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). 
Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. 
Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher‐rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.90 to ‐0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low‐quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of ‐9.6 points (95% CI ‐13.75 to ‐6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD‐RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD‐RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis‐adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2). 
Secondary outcomes. Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non‐serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis‐adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non‐serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. 
Teacher‐rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low‐quality evidence).
