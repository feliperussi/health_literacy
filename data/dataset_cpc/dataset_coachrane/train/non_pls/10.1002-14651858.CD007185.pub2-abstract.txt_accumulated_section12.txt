Background
Beta‐blockers are one of the more commonly prescribed classes of anti‐hypertensive drugs, both as first‐line and second‐line. 
Objectives
To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta‐blocker therapy when given as a second‐line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension. 
Search methods
CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966‐Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988‐Aug 2009) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched. 
Selection criteria
Double‐blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta‐blocker in combination with a drug from another class of anti‐hypertensive drugs compared with that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality of each included study. 
Main results
20 double‐blind RCTs evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of beta‐blockers as second‐line drug in 3744 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 158/102 mmHg; mean duration of 7 weeks). The BP reduction from adding a beta‐blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta‐blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta‐blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta‐blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta‐blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs.
