Background
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta‐blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in unselected patients remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta‐blockers in cardiac and non‐cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update and assesses the evidence in cardiac surgery only. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta‐blockers for the prevention of surgery‐related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward‐ and forward‐citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐randomized studies comparing beta‐blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing cardiac surgery. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta‐blocker, and studies in which beta‐blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.
