We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in the current version of the review. Seven trials compared standard‐dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three‐arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard‐dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high‐dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes, but there was no difference between standard and high‐dose levels (low‐certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard‐dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low‐certainty evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low‐certainty evidence). There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs.
