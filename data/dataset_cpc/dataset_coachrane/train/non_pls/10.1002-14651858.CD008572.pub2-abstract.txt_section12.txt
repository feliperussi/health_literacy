In total, we included 23 RCTs (N = 1309), 13 of which (56%) had low RoB. We included both men and women with a mean age of 50.6 years. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence as very low to moderate. Twelve studies examined suspected facet joint pain, five studies disc pain, two studies SI joint pain, two studies radicular CLBP, one study suspected radiating low back pain and one study CLBP with or without suspected radiation. Overall, moderate evidence suggests that facet joint RF denervation has a greater effect on pain compared with placebo over the short term (mean difference (MD) ‐1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.28 to ‐0.67). Low‐quality evidence indicates that facet joint RF denervation is more effective than placebo for function over the short term (MD ‐5.53, 95% CI ‐8.66 to ‐2.40) and over the long term (MD ‐3.70, 95% CI ‐6.94 to ‐0.47). Evidence of very low to low quality shows that facet joint RF denervation is more effective for pain than steroid injections over the short (MD ‐2.23, 95% CI ‐2.38 to ‐2.08), intermediate (MD ‐2.13, 95% CI ‐3.45 to ‐0.81), and long term (MD ‐2.65, 95% CI ‐3.43 to ‐1.88). RF denervation used for disc pain produces conflicting results, with no effects for RF denervation compared with placebo over the short and intermediate term, and small effects for RF denervation over the long term for pain relief (MD ‐1.63, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.68) and improved function (MD ‐6.75, 95% CI ‐13.42 to ‐0.09). Lack of evidence of short‐term effectiveness undermines the clinical plausibility of intermediate‐term or long‐term effectiveness. When RF denervation is used for SI joint pain, low‐quality evidence reveals no differences from placebo in effects on pain (MD ‐2.12, 95% CI ‐5.45 to 1.21) and function (MD ‐14.06, 95% CI ‐30.42 to 2.30) over the short term, and one study shows a small effect on both pain and function over the intermediate term. RF denervation is an invasive procedure that can cause a variety of complications. The quality and size of original studies were inadequate to permit assessment of how often complications occur.
