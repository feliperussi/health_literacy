Background
Asthma is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission among children and constitutes a significant economic burden. Use of non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in the care of children with acute asthma has increased even though evidence supporting the intervention has been considered weak and clinical guidelines do not recommend the intervention. NPPV might be an effective intervention for acute asthma, but no systematic review has been conducted to assess the effects of NPPV as an add‐on therapy to usual care in children with acute asthma. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of NPPV as an add‐on therapy to usual care (e.g. bronchodilators and corticosteroids) in children with acute asthma. 
Search methods
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR). The Register contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and by handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception to February 2016, with no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing NPPV as add‐on therapy to usual care versus usual care for children (age < 18 years) hospitalised for an acute asthma attack. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts. We retrieved all relevant full‐text study reports, independently screened the full text, identified trials for inclusion and identified and recorded reasons for exclusion of ineligible trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion or, if required, consulted a third review author. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses) flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We identified the risk of bias of included studies to reduce the risk of systematic error. We contacted relevant study authors when data were missing.
