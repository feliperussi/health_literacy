We identified 11 randomised trials comparing WLC with NBI for detection of colorectal polyps. In total eight randomised trials with 3673 participants provided data for our analyses. There was no statistically significant difference between WLC (standard definition and high definition pooled) and NBI for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps (6 trials, n = 2832, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04), patients with colorectal adenomas (8 trials, n = 3673, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.02), or patients with colorectal hyperplastic polyps (2 trials, n = 645, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00). Number of patients with at least one colorectal adenoma was not significantly different between WLC and NBI group irrespective of adenoma size (< 5 mm:RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08, I2 = 56%; 6 to 9 mm: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, I2 = 0%; ≥ 10 mm: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.45, I2 = 0%). Number of patients with at least one colorectal polyp, or colorectal adenoma was significantly lower in the standard definition WLC group compared to NBI group in fixed‐effect meta‐analysis (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, I2 = 78%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99, I2 = 0%, respectively), but not significantly different in random‐effects meta‐analysis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10, I2 = 78%). There was no statistically significant difference between high definition WLC and NBI in the number of patiens with at least one colorectal polyp or colorectal adenoma (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99, I2 = 0%, respectively).
