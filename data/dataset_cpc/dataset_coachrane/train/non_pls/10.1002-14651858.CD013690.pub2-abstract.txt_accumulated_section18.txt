Background
The use of mechanical thrombectomy to restore intracranial blood flow after proximal large artery occlusion by a thrombus has increased over time and led to better outcomes than intravenous thrombolytic therapy alone. Currently, the type of anaesthetic technique during mechanical thrombectomy is under debate as having a relevant impact on neurological outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different types of anaesthesia for endovascular interventions in people with acute ischaemic stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register of Trials on 5 July 2022, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and seven other databases on 21 March 2022. We performed searches of reference lists of included trials, grey literature sources, and other systematic reviews.  
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials with a parallel design that compared general anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia, conscious sedation anaesthesia, or monitored care anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke. We also included studies reported as full‐text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials, studies without a comparator group, and studies with a retrospective design. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The outcomes were assessed at different time periods, ranging from the onset of the stroke symptoms to 90 days after the start of the intervention. The main outcomes were functional outcome, neurological impairment, stroke‐related mortality, all intracranial haemorrhage, target artery revascularisation status, time to revascularisation, adverse events, and quality of life. All included studies reported data for early (up to 30 days) and long‐term (above 30 days) time points. 
Main results
We included seven trials with 982 participants, which investigated the type of anaesthesia for endovascular treatment in large vessel occlusion in the intracranial circulation. The outcomes were assessed at different time periods, ranging from the onset of stroke symptoms to 90 days after the procedure. Therefore, all included studies reported data for early (up to 30 days) and long‐term (above 30 up to 90 days) time points. 
General anaesthesia versus non‐general anaesthesia(early) 
We are uncertain about the effect of general anaesthesia on functional outcomes compared to non‐general anaesthesia (mean difference (MD) 0, 95% confidence interval (CI) –0.31 to 0.31; P = 1.0; 1 study, 90 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in time to revascularisation from groin puncture until the arterial reperfusion (MD 2.91 minutes, 95% CI –5.11 to 10.92; P = 0.48; I² = 48%; 5 studies, 498 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). General anaesthesia may lead to no difference in neurological impairment up to 48 hours after the procedure (MD –0.29, 95% CI –1.18 to 0.59; P = 0.52; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 982 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and in stroke‐related mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; P = 0.94; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 330 participants; low‐certainty evidence), all intracranial haemorrhages (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29; P = 0.63; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 693 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to non‐general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia may improve adverse events (haemodynamic instability) compared to non‐general anaesthesia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79; P = 0.02; I² = 71%; 2 studies, 229 participants; low‐certainty evidence). General anaesthesia improves target artery revascularisation compared to non‐general anaesthesia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I² = 29%; 7 studies, 982 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no available data for quality of life. 
General anaesthesia versus non‐general anaesthesia (long‐term) 
There is no difference in general anaesthesia compared to non‐general anaesthesia for dichotomous and continuous functional outcomes (dichotomous: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.58; P = 0.16; I² = 29%; 4 studies, 625 participants; low‐certainty evidence; continuous: MD –0.14, 95% CI –0.34 to 0.06; P = 0.17; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 978 participants; low‐certainty evidence). General anaesthesia showed no changes in stroke‐related mortality compared to non‐general anaesthesia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.22; P = 0.44; I² = 12%; 6 studies, 843 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no available data for neurological impairment, all intracranial haemorrhages, target artery revascularisation status, time to revascularisation from groin puncture until the arterial reperfusion, adverse events (haemodynamic instability), or quality of life. 
Ongoing studies 
We identified eight ongoing studies. Five studies compared general anaesthesia versus conscious sedation anaesthesia, one study compared general anaesthesia versus conscious sedation anaesthesia plus local anaesthesia, and two studies compared general anaesthesia versus local anaesthesia. Of these studies, seven plan to report data on functional outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale, five studies on neurological impairment, six studies on stroke‐related mortality, two studies on all intracranial haemorrhage, five studies on target artery revascularisation status, four studies on time to revascularisation, and four studies on adverse events. One ongoing study plans to report data on quality of life. One study did not plan to report any outcome of interest for this review.
