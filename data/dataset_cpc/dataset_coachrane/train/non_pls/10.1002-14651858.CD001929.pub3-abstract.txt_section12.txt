In total we included 25 trials (3096 participants) in this review update. The majority was funded by not‐for‐profit organizations. One trial included participants with acute LBP, and the remaining trials included people with sub‐acute or chronic LBP (CLBP). In three trials massage was done with a mechanical device, and the remaining trials used only the hands. The most common type of bias in these studies was performance and measurement bias because it is difficult to blind participants, massage therapists and the measuring outcomes. We judged the quality of the evidence to be "low" to "very low", and the main reasons for downgrading the evidence were risk of bias and imprecision. There was no suggestion of publication bias. For acute LBP, massage was found to be better than inactive controls for pain ((SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐1.85 to ‐0.64; participants = 51; studies = 1)) in the short‐term, but not for function ((SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐1.06 to 0.06; participants = 51; studies = 1)). For sub‐acute and chronic LBP, massage was better than inactive controls for pain ((SMD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.60; participants = 761; studies = 7)) and function (SMD ‐0.72, 95% CI ‐1.05 to ‐0.39; 725 participants; 6 studies; ) in the short‐term, but not in the long‐term; however, when compared to active controls, massage was better for pain, both in the short ((SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.62 to ‐0.13; participants = 964; studies = 12)) and long‐term follow‐up ((SMD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.01; participants = 757; studies = 5)), but no differences were found for function (both in the short and long‐term). There were no reports of serious adverse events in any of these trials. Increased pain intensity was the most common adverse event reported in 1.5% to 25% of the participants.
