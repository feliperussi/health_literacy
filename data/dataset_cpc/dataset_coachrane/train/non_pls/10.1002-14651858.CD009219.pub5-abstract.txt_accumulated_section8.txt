Background
Platinum‐based therapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin or a combination of these, is used to treat a variety of paediatric malignancies. One of the most significant adverse effects is the occurrence of hearing loss or ototoxicity. In an effort to prevent this ototoxicity, different otoprotective medical interventions have been studied. This review is the third update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of medical interventions to prevent hearing loss and to determine possible effects of these interventions on antitumour efficacy, toxicities other than hearing loss and quality of life in children with cancer treated with platinum‐based therapy as compared to placebo, no additional treatment or another protective medical intervention. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase (Ovid) to 8 January 2019. We handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (2006 up to and including 2018), the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (2007 up to and including 2018) and the International Conference on Long‐Term Complications of Treatment of Children and Adolescents for Cancer (2010 up to and including 2015). We scanned ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch) for ongoing trials (on 2 January 2019). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating platinum‐based therapy with an otoprotective medical intervention versus platinum‐based therapy with placebo, no additional treatment or another protective medical intervention in children with cancer.
