Background
Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It is a common public health problem with an estimated global prevalence of 300 million cases. Serious adverse effects have been reported for some drugs used to treat scabies. 
Objectives
To evaluate topical and systemic drugs for treating scabies.
Search methods
In June 2010, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and INDMED. In August 2010, we also searched the grey literature and sources for registered trials. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of drug treatments for scabies.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and data combined where appropriate. 
Main results
Twenty‐two small trials involving 2676 people were included. One trial was placebo controlled, 18 compared two or more drug treatments, three compared treatment regimens, and one compared different drug vehicles. 
Fewer treatment failures occurred by day seven with oral ivermectin compared with placebo in one small trial (55 participants). Topical permethrin appeared more effective than oral ivermectin (140 participants, 2 trials), topical crotamiton (194 participants, 2 trials), and topical lindane (753 participants, 5 trials). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence than either crotamiton (94 participants, 1 trial) or lindane (490 participants, 2 trials). No difference was detected between permethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) and a natural pyrethrin‐based topical treatment (40 participants, 1 trial), and between permethrin and benzyl benzoate (53 participants, 1 trial), however both these trials were small.
