Background
Indwelling urethral catheters are often used for bladder drainage in hospital. Urinary tract infection is the most common hospital‐acquired infection, and a common complication of urinary catheterisation. Pain, ease of use and quality of life are important to consider, as well as formal economic analysis. Suprapubic catheterisation can also result in bowel perforation and death. 
Objectives
To determine the advantages and disadvantages of alternative routes of short‐term bladder catheterisation in adults in terms of infection, adverse events, replacement, duration of use, participant satisfaction and cost effectiveness. For the purpose of this review, we define 'short‐term' as intended duration of catheterisation for 14 days or less. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 26 February 2015), CINAHL (searched 27 January 2015) and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing different routes of catheterisation for short‐term use in hospitalised adults. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors extracted data and performed 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included trials. We sought clarification from the trialists if further information was required. 
Main results
In this systematic review, we included 42 trials.
Twenty‐five trials compared indwelling urethral and suprapubic catheterisation. There was insufficient evidence for symptomatic urinary tract infection (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.69; 5 trials, 575 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Participants with indwelling catheters had more cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.10; 19 trials, 1894 participants; very low quality evidence) and more participants reported pain (RR 5.62, 95% CI 3.31 to 9.55; 4 trials, 535 participants; low‐quality evidence). Duration of catheterisation was shorter in the indwelling urethral catheter group (MD ‐1.73, 95% CI ‐2.42 to ‐1.05; 2 trials, 274 participants).
