No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all‐cause mortality or non‐fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow‐up of one year or less). There was also considerable heterogeneity between studies, which meant that it was not possible to combine studies statistically for cardiovascular risk (I2 statistic for systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 96%, for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 96%, for total cholesterol 96%, low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) 95%, high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (HDL‐C) 98%, triglycerides 75%). Nine trials measured blood pressure, six individual trials found reductions in SBP (reductions ranged from ‐22.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐26.3 to ‐17.7) to ‐11.5 mmHg (95% CI ‐21.5 to ‐1.46)), two trials found no clear evidence of a difference (however, CIs were wide and an increase or decrease in SBP cannot be ruled out), and one trial found an increase in SBP with tai chi (increase 5.2 mmHg, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.67). A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from ‐12.2 mmHg (95% CI ‐15.8 to ‐8.7) to ‐4.43 mmHg (95% CI ‐7.14 to ‐1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs. Three trials reported lipid levels and two found reductions in total cholesterol, LDL‐C and triglycerides (total cholesterol reductions ranged from ‐1.30 mmol/L (95% CI ‐1.57 to ‐1.03) to ‐0.50 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.26): LDL‐C reductions ranged from ‐0.76 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.59) to ‐0.59 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.38): triglyceride reductions ranged from ‐0.46 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.62 to ‐0.30) to ‐0.37 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.67 to‐0.07)) and increased HDL‐C with the intervention (HDL‐C increases ranged from 0.61 mmol/L (95% CI 0.51 to 0.71) to 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.02 to 0.30)), while the third study found no clear evidence of a difference between groups on lipid levels. Quality of life was measured in one trial: tai chi improved quality of life at three months. None of the included trials reported on adverse events, costs or occurrence of type 2 diabetes.
