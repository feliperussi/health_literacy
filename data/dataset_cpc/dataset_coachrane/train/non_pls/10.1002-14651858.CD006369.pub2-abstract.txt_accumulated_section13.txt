Background
Paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone, is now available in an oral formulation for daily use; an intramuscular formulation for monthly administration is expected to follow shortly. Oral paliperidone is available commercially only in an extended release formulation that was used in all of the clinical trials we examined in this review. 
Objectives
To compare effects of oral paliperidone with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2008) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material. 
Selection criteria
We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). We calculated Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) for continuous data. 
Main results
Eight studies with 2567 participants compared paliperidone with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone (n=1926, 7 RCTs, RR 0.68 CI 0.61 to 0.75, NNT 7 CI 6 to 10) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone were significantly more likely to have an improvement in global state (n=1420, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.63 to 0.75, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). People randomised to paliperidone were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n=1918, 7 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.34 to 0.66, NNT 17 CI 14 to 26) than those allocated to placebo. Paliperidone was associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia than placebo (n=1638, 5 RCTs, RR 1.88 CI 1.28 to 2.76, NNH 21 CI 11 to 90) and a consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) for both men (n=413, 4 RCTs, WMD 27.68 CI 23.66 to 31.69) and women (n=252, 4 RCTs, WMD 87.39 CI 74.27 to 100.51). People receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience extrapyramidal disorders (n=1680, 6 RCTs, RR 2.27 CI 1.31 to 3.95, NNH 28 CI 12 to 111) and weight gain (n=769, 4 RCTs, WMD 1.07 CI 0.65 to 1.49, I‐squared 78%) compared with those allocated to placebo. 
Three studies with 1692 participants compared paliperidone with 10 mg/day olanzapine. We found no differences between paliperidone and olanzapine for leaving in the short term (n=1332, 3 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.89 to 1.21; ˜40% in both groups left by six weeks). Those receiving any dose of paliperidone were no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving olanzapine (n=1327, 3 RCTs, RR 1.07 CI 0.64 to 1.76). Data from all three studies found that paliperidone was associated with less weight change than olanzapine (n=660, 3 RCTs, WMD ‐0.88 CI ‐1.38 to ‐0.37). Results for various movement disorders all favoured olanzapine.
