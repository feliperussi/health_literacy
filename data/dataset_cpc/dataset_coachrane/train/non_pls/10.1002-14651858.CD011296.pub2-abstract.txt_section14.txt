Six trials compared SSI with a basal‐bolus insulin scheme, three of which investigating 64% of all participants in this category also applying an SSI approach in the bolus comparator part. One trial had a basal insulin‐only comparator arm, and the remaining trial used continuous insulin infusion as the comparator. For our main comparison of SSI versus basal‐bolus insulin, the results were as follows. Four trials reported mortality data. One out of 268 participants in the SSI group (0.3%) compared with two out of 334 participants in the basal‐bolus group (0.6%) died (low‐certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, defined as blood glucose levels below 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L), showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 5 trials; 667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.02 and 2.57. All nine severe hypoglycaemic episodes were observed among the 369 participants on basal‐bolus insulin (2.4%). The mean length of hospital stay was 0.5 days longer for the SSI group, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 1.4; P = 0.32; 6 trials; 717 participants; very low‐certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐1.7 days and 2.7 days. Adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, such as postoperative infections, showed a RR of 1.16, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.37; P = 0.85; 3 trials; 481 participants; very low‐certainty evidence. The mean blood glucose levels ranged across basal‐bolus groups from 156 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) to 221 mg/dL (12.3 mmol/L). The mean blood glucose level in the SSI groups was 14.8 mg/dL (0.8 mmol/L) higher (95% CI 7.8 (0.4) to 21.8 (1.2); P < 0.001; 6 trials; 717 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐3.6 mg/dL (‐0.2 mmol/L) and 33.2 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). No trial reported on diabetes‐related mortality or socioeconomic effects.
