Background
Most people who stop smoking gain weight. This can discourage some people from making a quit attempt and risks offsetting some, but not all, of the health advantages of quitting. Interventions to prevent weight gain could improve health outcomes, but there is a concern that they may undermine quitting. 
Objectives
To systematically review the effects of: (1) interventions targeting post‐cessation weight gain on weight change and smoking cessation (referred to as 'Part 1') and (2) interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that plausibly affect post‐cessation weight gain (referred to as 'Part 2'). 
Search methods
Part 1 ‐ We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register and CENTRAL; latest search 16 October 2020. 
Part 2 ‐ We searched included studies in the following 'parent' Cochrane reviews: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, e‐cigarettes, and exercise interventions for smoking cessation published in Issue 10, 2020 of the Cochrane Library. We updated register searches for the review of nicotine receptor partial agonists. 
Selection criteria
Part 1 ‐ trials of interventions that targeted post‐cessation weight gain and had measured weight at any follow‐up point or smoking cessation, or both, six or more months after quit day. 
Part 2 ‐ trials included in the selected parent Cochrane reviews reporting weight change at any time point. 
Data collection and analysis
Screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. Change in weight was expressed as difference in weight change from baseline to follow‐up between trial arms and was reported only in people abstinent from smoking. Abstinence from smoking was expressed as a risk ratio (RR). Where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis using the inverse variance method for weight, and Mantel‐Haenszel method for smoking.
