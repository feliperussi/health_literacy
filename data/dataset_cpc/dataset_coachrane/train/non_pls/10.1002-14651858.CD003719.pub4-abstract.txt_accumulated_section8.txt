Background
For the last few decades urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG) has been used to trigger final oocyte maturation in cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Recombinant technology has allowed the production of two drugs, recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG) and recombinant luteinising hormone (rLH), that can be used for the same purpose, to mimic the endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) surge. This allows commercial manufacturers to adjust production according to market requirements and to remove all urinary contaminants, facilitating the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch‐to‐batch variation. However, prior to a change in practice, it is necessary to compare the effectiveness of the recombinant drugs to the currently used urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of subcutaneous rhCG and high dose rLH versus uhCG for inducing final oocyte maturation in subfertile women undergoing IVF and ICSI cycles. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (April 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to April 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to April 2015) as well as trial registers at ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 May 2015 and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal on 14 May 2015. 
Selection criteria
Two review authors independently scanned titles and abstracts and selected those that appeared relevant for collection of the full paper. We included randomised controlled trials comparing rhCG and rLH with urinary hCG for final oocyte maturation triggering in IVF and ICSI cycles for treatment of infertility in normogonadotropic women.
