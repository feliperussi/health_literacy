Background
The main clinical intervention for mild to moderate hearing loss is the provision of hearing aids. These are routinely offered and fitted to those who seek help for hearing difficulties. By amplifying and improving access to sounds, and speech sounds in particular, the aim of hearing aid use is to reduce the negative consequences of hearing loss and improve participation in everyday life. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss in adults.
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; the Cochrane Register of Studies Online; MEDLINE; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 March 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hearing aids compared to a passive or active control in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes in this review were hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life and the adverse effect pain. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, listening ability and the adverse effect noise‐induced hearing loss. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
We included five RCTs involving 825 participants. The studies were carried out in the USA and Europe, and were published between 1987 and 2017. Risk of bias across the studies varied. Most had low risk for selection, reporting and attrition bias, and a high risk for performance and detection bias because blinding was inadequate or absent. 
All participants had mild to moderate hearing loss. The average age across all five studies was between 69 and 83 years. The duration of the studies ranged between six weeks and six months.
