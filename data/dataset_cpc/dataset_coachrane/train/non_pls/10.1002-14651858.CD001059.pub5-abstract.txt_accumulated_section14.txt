Background
Pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia are common causes of serious morbidity and death. Calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, and may help to prevent preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2014. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of calcium supplementation during pregnancy on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and related maternal and child outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised trials, comparing high‐dose calcium supplementation (at least 1 g daily of calcium) during pregnancy with placebo. For low‐dose calcium we included quasi‐randomised trials, trials without placebo, trials with cointerventions and dose comparison trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two researchers independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two researchers assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 27 studies (18,064 women). We assessed the included studies as being at low risk of bias, although bias was frequently difficult to assess due to poor reporting and inadequate information on methods. 
High‐dose calcium supplementation ( ≥ 1 g/day) versus placebo  
Fourteen studies examined this comparison, however one study contributed no data. The 13 studies contributed data from 15,730 women to our meta‐analyses. The average risk of high blood pressure (BP) was reduced with calcium supplementation compared with placebo (12 trials, 15,470 women: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.81; I² = 74%). There was also a reduction in the risk of pre‐eclampsia associated with calcium supplementation (13 trials, 15,730 women: average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.65; I² = 70%; low‐quality evidence). This effect was clear for women with low calcium diets (eight trials, 10,678 women: average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65; I² = 76%) but not those with adequate calcium diets. The effect appeared to be greater for women at higher risk of pre‐eclampsia, though this may be due to small‐study effects (five trials, 587 women: average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42). These data should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of small‐study effects or publication bias. In the largest trial, the reduction in pre‐eclampsia was modest (8%) and the CI included the possibility of no effect.
