Background
Conventionally used soybean oil‐based lipid emulsion (S‐LE) have high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols that may contribute to adverse effects in preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are currently available for use in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and efficacy of all LE for parenteral nutrition (PN) in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) including preterm infants with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis using direct comparisons and pair‐wise meta‐analyses. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 June 2018), Embase (1974 to 18 July 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2018), MIDRIS (1971 to 31 May 2018), conference proceedings, trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO's Trials Registry and Platform), and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies in preterm infants with or without surgical conditions or PNALD within the first six months of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for important outcomes in addition to reporting statistical significance of results. 
Main results
We included 29 studies (n = 2037) in this review. LE were classified in three broad groups: 1. all fish oil‐containing LE including pure fish oil‐LE (F‐LE) and multisource LE (e.g. medium‐chain triglycerides (MCT)‐olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MOFS‐LE), MCT‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MFS‐LE) and olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (OFS‐LE); 2. conventional S‐LE; 3. alternative‐LE (e.g. MCT‐soybean oil‐LE (MS‐LE), olive‐soybean oil‐LE and borage oil‐based LE).
