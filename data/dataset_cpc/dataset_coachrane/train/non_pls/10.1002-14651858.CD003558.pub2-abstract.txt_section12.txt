Of 67 identified studies, 17 trials involving 1279 children and eight trials involving 321 adults with asthma were eligible. Thirteen (76%) of the paediatric studies and six (75%) of the adult studies were judged to be high quality. Among children, ICS were associated with a higher final mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.07 litres, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02 to 0.11) and higher mean final peak expiratory flow rate [PEF] (WMD 17.3 litres/minute, 95% CI 11.3 to 23.3) than SCG. In addition, ICS were associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD ‐1.18 exacerbations per year, 95% CI ‐2.15 to ‐ 0.21), lower asthma symptom scores, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no group differences in the proportion of children with adverse effects. Among adults, ICS were similarly associated with a higher mean final FEV1 (WMD 0.21 litres, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) and a higher final endpoint PEF (WMD 28.2 litres/minute, 95% CI 18.7 to 37.6) than SCG. ICS were also associated with fewer exacerbations (WMD ‐3.30 exacerbations per year, 95% CI ‐5.62 to ‐0.98), lower asthma symptom scores among cross‐over trials but not parallel trials, and less rescue bronchodilator use than SCG. There were no differences in the proportion of adults with adverse effects. In subgroup analyses involving lung function measures, paediatric and adult studies judged to be of high quality had results consistent with the overall results. Lung function measures in children were higher in studies with medium BDP‐equivalent steroid dosages than low BDP‐equivalent dosages, while adult studies could not be compared by steroid dosage since they all incorporated similar dosages. There were no significant differences in lung function by the asthma severity of participants for adult or child studies.
