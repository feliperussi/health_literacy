Background
Buprenorphine maintenance treatment has been evaluated in randomised controlled trials against placebo medication, and separately as an alternative to methadone for management of opioid dependence. 
Objectives
To evaluate buprenorphine maintenance compared to placebo and to methadone maintenance in the management of opioid dependence, including its ability to retain people in treatment, suppress illicit drug use, reduce criminal activity, and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases to January 2013: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Review Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, PsycLIT, CORK, Alcohol and Drug Council of Australia, Australian Drug Foundation, Centre for Education and Information on Drugs and Alcohol, Library of Congress, reference lists of identified studies and reviews. We sought published/unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of buprenorphine maintenance treatment versus placebo or methadone in management of opioid‐dependent persons. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane Collaboration methodology.
Main results
We include 31 trials (5430 participants), the quality of evidence varied from high to moderate quality. 
There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine was superior to placebo medication in retention of participants in treatment at all doses examined. Specifically, buprenorphine retained participants better than placebo: at low doses (2 ‐ 6 mg), 5 studies, 1131 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.88; at medium doses (7 ‐ 15 mg), 4 studies, 887 participants, RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.87; and at high doses (≥ 16 mg), 5 studies, 1001 participants, RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.90. However, there is moderate quality of evidence that only high‐dose buprenorphine (≥ 16 mg) was more effective than placebo in suppressing illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis in the trials, 3 studies, 729 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐1.85 to ‐0.49, Notably, low‐dose, (2 studies, 487 participants, SMD 0.10; 95% CI ‐0.80 to 1.01), and medium‐dose, (2 studies, 463 participants, SMD ‐0.08; 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.62) buprenorphine did not suppress illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis better than placebo.
