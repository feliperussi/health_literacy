Background
Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body results in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply, impaired drainage of waste products and damage to cells. If a patient with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues become depleted of blood flow and there is no oxygen or nutrient supply to the wound, and no removal of waste products from the wound, all of which are necessary for healing. Patients who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. This review has been conducted to clarify the role of repositioning in the management of patients with pressure ulcers. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of repositioning patients on the healing rates of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
For this third update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 28 August 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE (2013 to August Week 3 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations 29 August, 2014); Ovid EMBASE (2012 to 29 August, 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (2012 to 27 August 2014). 
Selection criteria
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing repositioning with no repositioning, or RCTs comparing different repositioning techniques, or RCTs comparing different repositioning frequencies for the review. Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were only to be considered in the absence of RCTs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed titles and, where available, abstracts of the studies identified by the search strategy for their eligibility. We obtained full versions of potentially relevant studies and two authors independently screened these against the inclusion criteria.
