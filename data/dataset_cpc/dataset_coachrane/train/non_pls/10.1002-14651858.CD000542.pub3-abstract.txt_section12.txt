Twenty‐seven studies (1,011 participants) were included. Three studies were rated as low risk of bias. Seven studies were rated as high risk of bias and 17 were rated as unclear risk of bias due to insufficient information. Seventeen trials compared different formulations of EN, 13 studies compared one or more elemental formulas to a non‐elemental formula, three studies compared EN diets of similar protein composition but different fat composition, and one study compared non‐elemental diets differing in glutamine enrichment. Meta‐analysis of 11 trials (378 participants) demonstrated no difference in remission rates. Sixty‐four per cent (134/210) of patients in the elemental group achieved remission compared to 62% (105/168) of patients in the non‐elemental group (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; GRADE very low quality). A per‐protocol analysis (346 participants) produced similar results (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). Subgroup analyses performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non‐elemental diets (elemental, semi‐elemental and polymeric) showed no differences in remission rates. An analysis of 7 trials including 209 patients treated with EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no difference in remission rates (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26). Very low fat content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) and very low long chain triglycerides demonstrated higher remission rates than higher content EN formulas. There was no difference between elemental and non‐elemental diets in adverse event rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.60; GRADE very low quality), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.09; GRADE very low quality). Common adverse events included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and bloating.
