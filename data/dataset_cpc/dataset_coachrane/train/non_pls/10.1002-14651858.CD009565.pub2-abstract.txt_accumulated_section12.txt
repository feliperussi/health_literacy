Background
Musculoskeletal, ligamentous and osseous groin injuries are common in athletes and may result in a delay of several months to resume sports. Even then, this may not be at the former level of sport activity. The treatment of exercise‐related groin pain is mainly conservative (non‐surgical), using interventions such as exercises, electrotherapy, manual therapy and steroid injections. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1948 to November week 3 2011); EMBASE (1980 to Week 49 2011); CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); LILACS (1982 to December 2011); PEDro (1929 to December 2011), SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2011), OTseeker (to December 2011), reference lists of papers and conference proceedings (2000 to 2011). 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain were included. Studies comparing conservative with surgical treatments were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments. There was no pooling of data. 
Main results
Two studies, involving a total of 122 participants who had experienced adductor‐related groin pain for at least two months, were included in this review. All but one of the participants were male athletes aged between 18 and 50 years old. Both studies were assessed as 'high risk of bias' for at least one source of bias domain. The 'successful treatment' outcome reported in both studies was based primarily on pain measures.
