Background
In terms of clinical outcomes, women with schizophrenia seem to fare better then men, but appear more vulnerable to psychotic illness in the period after birth and menopause. As these vulnerable periods to psychosis are associated with estrogen withdrawal, this hormone has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia. 
Objectives
To evaluate the clinical effects of estrogens alone or in combination with progesterone, as a sole treatment or as an adjunctive therapy, for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2003) was supplemented with manual reference inspection of all identified studies. Authors of trials were contacted for further material and archive information. 
Selection criteria
All randomised clinical trials comparing estrogens with or without progesterone, as a sole or adjunctive treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious, non‐affective psychotic illness. 
Data collection and analysis
We evaluated data independently and analysed on an intention to treat basis. For binary data we calculated the fixed effect relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous non‐skewed data, we calculated weighted mean differences. 
Main results
All available evidence relates to women. Four studies (n=108) compared estrogen only with placebo. Short‐term scores for general mental state showed no significant difference between groups (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD PANSS for 100mcg comparison ‐2.26 CI ‐15.4 to 10.9). Data from all four studies showed overall loss from the studies was low (˜5%), with no significant differences between groups (n=96, 4 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.2 to 6.1). Skewed continuous data from two studies showed no clear differences in ratings of movement disorders.
