Background
The World Health Organization recommends that abortion can be provided at the lowest level of the healthcare system. Training mid‐level providers, such as midwives, nurses and other non‐physician providers, to conduct first trimester aspiration abortions and manage medical abortions has been proposed as a way to increase women's access to safe abortion procedures. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and effectiveness of abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL Issue 7, MEDLINE and POPLINE databases for comparative studies of doctor and mid‐level providers of abortion services. We searched for studies published in any language from January 1980 until 15 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clustered or not clustered), prospective cohort studies or observational studies that compared the safety or effectiveness (or both) of any type of first trimester abortion procedure, administered by any type of mid‐level provider or doctors, were eligible for inclusion in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors screened abstracts for eligibility and double‐extracted data from the included studies using a pre‐tested form. We meta‐analysed primary outcome data using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models to obtain pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We carried out separate analyses by study design (RCT or cohort) and type of abortion procedure (medical versus surgical). 
Main results
Eight studies involving 22,018 participants met our eligibility criteria. Five studies (n = 18,962) assessed the safety and effectiveness of surgical abortion procedures administered by mid‐level providers compared to doctors. Three studies (n = 3056) assessed the safety and effectiveness of medical abortion procedures. The surgical abortion studies (one RCT and four cohort studies) were carried out in the United States, India, South Africa and Vietnam. The medical abortion studies (two RCTs and one cohort study) were carried out in India, Sweden and Nepal. The studies included women with gestational ages up to 14 weeks for surgical abortion and nine weeks for medical abortion.
