Background
Kinesio Taping (KT) is one of the conservative treatments proposed for rotator cuff disease. KT is an elastic, adhesive, latex‐free taping made from cotton, without active pharmacological agents. Clinicians have adopted it in the rehabilitation treatment of painful conditions, however, there is no firm evidence on its benefits. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of KT in adults with rotator cuff disease.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICRTP registry to July 27 2020, unrestricted by date and language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with rotator cuff disease. Major outcomes were overall pain, function, pain on motion, active range of motion, global assessment of treatment success, quality of life, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 23 trials with 1054 participants. Nine studies (312 participants) assessed the effectiveness of KT versus sham therapy and fourteen studies (742 participants) assessed the effectiveness of KT versus conservative treatment. Most participants were aged between 18 and 50 years. Females comprised 52% of the sample. For the meta‐analysis, we considered the last available measurement within 30 days from the end of the intervention. 
All trials were at risk of performance, selection, reporting, attrition, and other biases.  
Comparison with sham taping 
Due to very low‐certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether KT improves overall pain, function, pain on motion and active range of motion compared with sham taping.
