Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of disability and the leading cause of death worldwide. To reduce mortality and morbidity, prevention strategies such as following an optimal diet are crucial. In recent years, low‐gluten and gluten‐free diets have gained strong popularity in the general population. However, study results on the benefits of a gluten‐reduced or gluten‐free diet are conflicting, and it is unclear whether a gluten‐reduced diet has an effect on the primary prevention of CVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of a gluten‐reduced or gluten‐free diet for the primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science up to June 2021 without language restrictions or restrictions regarding publication status. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and checked reference lists of included studies as well as relevant systematic reviews for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), such as prospective cohort studies, comparing a low‐gluten or gluten‐free diet or providing advice to decrease gluten consumption with no intervention, diet as usual, or a reference gluten‐intake category. The population of interest comprised adults from the general population, including those at increased risk for CVD (primary prevention). We excluded cluster‐RCTs, case‐control studies, studies focusing on participants with a previous myocardial infarction and/or stroke, participants who have undergone a revascularisation procedure as well as participants with angina or angiographically‐defined coronary heart disease, with a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or with type 1 diabetes.
