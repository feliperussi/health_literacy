Two studies with 1969 participants compared flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate with flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection. The mean doses of paliperidone palmitate in these trials were 73.3 and 104.6 mg every four weeks compared with risperidone long‐acting injection at mean doses, respectively, of 35.3 and 31.7 mg every two weeks. We found no differences between paliperidone palmitate and risperidone long‐acting injection for leaving these studies early for any reason (n = 1969, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 1.00 to 1.25). Those receiving paliperidone palmitate were statistically no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving risperidone long‐acting injection (n = 1961, 2 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.98 to 1.53). While we found no significant difference in the occurrences of deaths in the pooled trials (n = 1967, 2 RCTs, RR 3.62 CI 0.60 to 21.89), we note that a total of six deaths occurred in these two trials, with five deaths among people who received paliperidone palmitate and one death among people who received risperidone long‐acting injection. Although death is the most serious of adverse events, the small number of these events in these trials makes it unclear if this finding is meaningful. We found that participants randomised to paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to use anticholinergic medications in these trials (n = 1587, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67 CI 0.55 to 0.82, NNTB 13 CI 10 to 24).   We found no data regarding paliperidone palmitate relating to services use, quality of life, behaviour, patient satisfaction, cognitive functioning or cost.
