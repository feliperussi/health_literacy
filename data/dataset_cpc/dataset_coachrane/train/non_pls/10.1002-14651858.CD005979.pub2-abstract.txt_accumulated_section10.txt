Background
Pharmaceuticals are important interventions that could improve people's health. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used as cost‐containment measures to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Internal reference pricing establishes a benchmark or reference price within a country which is the maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs. Other policies include price controls, maximum prices, index pricing, price negotiations and volume‐based pricing. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, drug expenditures and drug use.

Selection criteria
Policies in this review were defined as laws; rules; financial and administrative orders made by governments, non‐government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation and health outcomes or costs (expenditures); the study had to be a randomised trial, non‐randomised trial, interrupted time series (ITS), repeated measures (RM) study or a controlled before‐after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Results were summarised in tables. There were too few comparisons with similar outcomes across studies to allow for meta‐analysis or meaningful exploration of heterogeneity.
