The three studies comparing LMWH versus UFH reported the success rate of replantation using different units of analysis (participant or digit), so we were unable to combine data from all three studies (one study reported results for both participants and digits). No evidence of a benefit in success of replantation was seen in the LMWH group when compared with UFH, regardless of whether the outcomes were reported by number of participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.10; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence); or by number of digits (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 200 digits, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the incidence of compromised microcirculation requiring surgical or non‐surgical therapy, or any systemic/other causes of microvascular insufficiency. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the LMWH and UFH groups in occurrence of arterial occlusion (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence) or venous occlusion (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.27; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported adverse effects. The LMWH and UFH groups showed no evidence of a difference in wound bleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.23; 130 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), haematuria (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.11; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), ecchymoses (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.19; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), epistaxis (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), gingival bleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.43; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), and faecal occult blood (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). We could not pool data on coagulation abnormalities as varying definitions and tests were used in the three studies.
