Background
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide, with an age‐adjusted prevalence of 4 to 8 per 1000 population and an age‐adjusted incidence of 44 per 100,000 person‐years in developed countries. Monotherapy represents the best therapeutic option in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2019, Issue 11. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and tolerability of oral clonazepam used as monotherapy for newly diagnosed epilepsy, compared with placebo or a different anti‐seizure medication. 
Search methods
For the latest update of this review we searched the following databases on 14 September 2021: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 13 September 2021). CRS Web includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs or quasi‐RCTs comparing oral clonazepam used as monotherapy treatment versus placebo or a different anti‐seizure medication (active comparator) in people of any age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, defined according to the clinical practical definition proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). 
Data collection and analysis
The following outcomes were considered: proportion of participants seizure‐free at one, three, six, 12, and 24 months after randomization; proportion of responders (those with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to end of treatment); proportion of participants with treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the treatment period or leading to discontinuation during the treatment period; proportion of dropouts/withdrawals due to side effects, lack of efficacy or other reasons; and improvement in quality of life, as assessed by validated and reliable rating scales. 
Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts to assess the eligibility of publications identified by the searches. We independently extracted data from trial reports and cross‐checked them for accuracy. Any disagreements between the two authors regarding data extraction were resolved by discussion and consensus. We scrutinized trials and evaluated the methodological quality of all included studies. We used GRADE assessment criteria to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.
