Background
Incontinence after prostatectomy for benign or malignant disease is a well‐known and often a feared outcome. Although small degrees of incidental incontinence may go virtually unnoticed, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life. 
Conceptually, post‐prostatectomy incontinence may be caused by sphincter malfunction or bladder dysfunction, or both. Most men with post‐prostatectomy incontinence (60% to 100%) have stress urinary incontinence, which is involuntary urinary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. This may be due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency and may be treated with surgery for optimal management of incontinence. Detrusor dysfunction is more common after surgery for benign prostatic disease. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of surgical treatment for urinary incontinence related to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery for: 
‐ men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) ‐ transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), photo vaporisation of the prostate, laser enucleation of the prostate or open prostatectomy ‐ and 
‐ men with prostate cancer ‐ radical prostatectomy (retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic, or robotic). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 31 March 2014); MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2014); EMBASE (January 1988 to April 2014); and LILACS (January 1982 to April 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. We contacted investigators to locate studies.
