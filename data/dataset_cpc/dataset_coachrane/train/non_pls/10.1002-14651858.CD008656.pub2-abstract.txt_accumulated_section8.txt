Background
Stroke is the second leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Individuals who have suffered a stroke are at high risk of having another stroke likely leading to greater disability and institutionalization. Non‐pharmacological interventions may have a role to play in averting a second stroke. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of multi‐modal programs of non‐pharmacological interventions compared with usual care in preventing secondary vascular events and reducing vascular risk factors after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (September 2012); The Cochrane Library databases CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, HTA and NHS EED (2012 Issue 2); MEDLINE (1950 to February 2012); EMBASE (1974 to February 2012); CINAHL (1982 to February 2012); SPORTDiscus (1800 to February 2012); PsycINFO (1887 to February 2012) and Web of Science (1900 to February 2012). We also searched PEDro, OT Seeker, OpenSIGLE, REHABDATA and Dissertation Abstracts (February 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registers, scanned reference lists, and contacted authors and researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of non‐pharmacological interventions that included components traditionally used in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in adults with stroke or TIA. Primary outcomes were a cluster of second stroke or myocardial infarction or vascular death. Secondary outcomes were (1) secondary vascular events: second stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death, as well as (2) vascular risk factors: blood pressure, body weight, lipid profile, insulin resistance and tobacco use. We also recorded adverse events such as exercise‐related musculoskeletal injuries or cardiovascular events.
