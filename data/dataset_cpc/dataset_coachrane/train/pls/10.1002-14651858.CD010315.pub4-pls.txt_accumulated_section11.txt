Blood pressure targets in people with cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We assessed whether lower blood pressure goals are better than standard blood pressure goals for people with high blood pressure who also have heart or vascular problems. 
Background 
Many people with heart or vascular (blood vessels and circulatory system) problems also have high blood pressure. Some clinical guidelines recommend a lower blood pressure goal (135/85 mmHg or lower) for people with previous heart or vascular problems than for with those without (140 to 160 mmHg or less systolic and 90 to 100 mmHg diastolic or less are standard blood pressure goals). It is unclear whether lower goals lead to overall health benefits. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to November 2019.
Study characteristics 
For this updated review, we included six trials with 9484 participants who were followed up from one year to 4.7 years. We analyzed data to detect differences between lower and standard blood pressure goals in terms of numbers of deaths and numbers of serious side effects (leading to hospital admission). 
Key results 
We found little to no differences in total numbers of deaths, or heart or vascular deaths between lower and standard blood pressure goal approaches. Similar findings of little to no differences were also found for the total number of heart problems, or vascular problems and total serious harms, but the evidence was less certain. Based on very uncertain and limited information, we found more dropouts resulting from drug‚Äêrelated harms in the lower blood pressure target group and no overall health benefit among people in the lower target group.
