Alvimopan for recovery of bowel function after radical cystectomy
Review question 
In patients who have their bladder removed, does the drug alvimopan compared to placebo help them recover their bowel function more quickly? 
Background 
Surgical removal of the bladder is a major operation that requires a stay of several days in hospital. One of the issues that keeps patients in hospital is not being able to eat normal food and not having bowel movements, an issue that is referred to as ileus. Alvimopan is a drug that is being used to treat this problem but it is uncertain how well it works and what its side effects are when used in this setting. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a comprehensive literature search for randomized controlled trials and found one study that addressed our question. This study was a randomized trial of adults undergoing surgery to remove their bladder. They received either 12 mg alvimopan of up to 15 doses over seven days (143 patients) or placebo (137 patients). This study was conducted at centres that did many of these operations (at least 50 per year), had experienced surgeons and also used other measures such as asking patients to get out of bed soon after surgery to hasten bowel recovery. 
Key results 
We found that patients who receive alvimopan short‚Äêterm probably tolerate solid food faster, are discharged from the hospital more quickly and have fewer major adverse events. We did not find any differences with regards to these patients' need to be readmitted to hospital, their risk of heart problems or their need for narcotic pain medications. Patients taking alvimopan were less likely to have a tube placed back into their stomach. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was rated as at least moderate as per GRADE for all primary outcomes. This means that our estimates of how well alvimopan works is likely close to how well it really works although there is a possibility that it may be different.
