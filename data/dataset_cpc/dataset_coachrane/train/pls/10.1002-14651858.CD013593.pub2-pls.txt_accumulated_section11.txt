Fluid removal therapy in acute heart failure
Review question 
What are the effects of ultrafiltration (UF), a fluid removal therapy, in acute heart failure (AHF)? 
Background 
AHF is a common condition where the heart does not pump effectively, causing fluid to accumulate in the lungs and body. This causes difficulty in breathing, damage to heart and kidneys, high readmission to hospital and high death rates. Usual care involves medications called diuretics to remove this excess fluid, but some people may become resistant to it. UF provides an alternative therapy to quickly remove fluid. A circuit removes blood from the patient, which is then filtered in a machine before going back to the patient. It requires monitoring, a large central line cannula (tube into a blood vessel) and a blood thinning medication. It is unclear whether UF is effective or safe in AHF.   
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies comparing UF to usual care in people with AHF. We searched for all relevant studies up to June 2021 and found 14 studies with about 1200 people. People who were very sick and frail, such as those who have had heart attacks and infections, were often not studied. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We used a validated tool (GRADE) to assess how certain we were of our results. Overall, there was low‐certainty evidence from these studies because of variability in the study settings, conflicting results between studies and limitations in how the studies were designed.  
Key results 
We are uncertain whether UF has an impact on death rates at a short‐term follow‐up, as there are not enough data. At the longest time of follow‐up, UF may have little effect on death rates.
