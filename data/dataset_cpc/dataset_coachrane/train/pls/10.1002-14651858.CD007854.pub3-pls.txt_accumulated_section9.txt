Acupuncture for period pain
Review question 
Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effect of acupuncture and acupressure versus a control to reduce menstrual pain and symptoms in all women of reproductive age with primary dysmenorrhoea. Primary dysmenorrhoea is defined as pain without any underlying cause. 
Background 
Dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain, is commonly experienced by younger women. Symptoms may include cramping pain in the lower abdomen that may spread to the lower back or front thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue, anxiety, and dizziness. Use of conventional treatments is high, but 20% to 25% of women still have inadequate pain relief. We therefore need other approaches to effectively manage symptoms of period pain. Acupuncture (the stimulation of points on the body using needles) and acupressure (stimulation of points on the body using pressure) are used to treat period pain, although we do not know how effective it is in reducing such pain. 
Study characteristics 
We have included 42 trials of acupuncture and acupressure compared to a control (sham/placebo, medication, Chinese herbs, no treatment or usual care) in a total of 4640 women of reproductive age with period pain. Twenty‚Äêtwo studies were undertaken in China. Eight studies were undertaken in Iran, four studies in Taiwan, two studies in Korea, and one each in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA.The evidence is current to September 2015. 
Key results 
There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether or not acupuncture or acupressure is effective in treating primary dysmenorrhoea, and for most comparisons no information was available on adverse events.
