How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms.
