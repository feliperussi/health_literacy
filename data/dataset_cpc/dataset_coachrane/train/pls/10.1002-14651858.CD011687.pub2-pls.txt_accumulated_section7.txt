Exercise for reducing falls in people living with and beyond cancer
Background 
People living with and beyond cancer are at risk of long‐term problems including an increased risk of accidental falls. This is a result of the effect that the disease and the treatment can have on their body. Exercise reduces the rate and risk of falls in older people and is known to improve quality of life, tiredness and pain in people who have had cancer. It is not clear whether exercise can reduce the risk of falls in people living with and beyond cancer. This review was designed to determine the effect of exercise in reducing falls in people living with and beyond cancer. 
Study characteristics 
In July 2018, we searched for clinical trials about exercise to reduce falls in adults living with and beyond cancer. We found 11 studies of variable quality and size, including a total of 835 people, that compared exercise to usual care. Most of the studies were very small, four with fewer than 30 people. Only one study reported on accidental falls. All 11 studies reported on one or more measures that are risk factors for falling (e.g. strength, flexibility and balance). 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence from the studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. The quality of the evidence was very low to low across all of the measures of interest. There were several weaknesses identified in the design of all studies including small numbers of participants. No study could prevent participants knowing their treatment and so there could have been bias.
