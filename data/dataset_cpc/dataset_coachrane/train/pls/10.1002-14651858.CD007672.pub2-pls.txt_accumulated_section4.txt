Interventions to improve the continuity of care in the follow‐up of patients with cancer 
Cancer is a very complex disease characterised by varying clinical features and treatment phases. The continuum of cancer care includes risk assessment, primary prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end‐of‐life care. Continuity of care is defined as how one patient experiences care over time, as coherent and linked, and is the result of good information flow, good interpersonal skills, and good coordination of care. The objectives of this review were to classify, describe and determine the effectiveness of interventions tested in the literature to improve continuity of care in the follow‐up of patients with cancer. 
Three main models of care (case management, shared care and interdisciplinary team) designed to improve continuity of care were identified in the 51 studies included in this review. We found no standard instruments that allow to specifically measure continuity of care in patients with cancer. According to our analysis, there was no clear evidence that the interventions assessed in this review either improved or worsened patient health‐related outcomes. Therefore, our analyses did not allow us to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve continuity of care in the follow‐up of patients with cancer. 
Few studies reported provider and informal caregiver outcomes, as well as process of care outcomes, so they could not be regrouped for analysis. The main limitations of this review were the various differences between the included studies, especially in their study designs, interventions, participants, patients' phase of care, measured outcomes, healthcare settings, and length of follow‐up.
