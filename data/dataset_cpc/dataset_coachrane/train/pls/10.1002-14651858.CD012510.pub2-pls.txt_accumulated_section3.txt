Drug‐eluting balloon angioplasty versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for stenosis of stents in lower limb arteries 
Background Many people have disease in their leg arteries that may develop into a blockage and lead to loss of circulation and subsequent pain, skin ulcers, and amputation of the leg. In an effort to prevent lack of blood from harming the leg, procedures can be performed to bypass the blocked artery using a vein or an artificial graft, or to cross it with a wire and open it with a balloon, then place a stent to help prevent the blockage from happening again. Although stents are very strong and can last a long time, it is possible that a stent inside an artery might at times become narrower, and eventually can become blocked. This process is known as "in‐stent restenosis." A blocked stent can be treated in several ways, such as sucking out the clot or ballooning it, or placing another stent inside the stent that failed. Although all treatment options offer advantages and disadvantages, there have been advancements in the technologies available to treat this problem. One of these advancements requires covering the balloon used to treat the stent blockage with a cytotoxic drug used in chemotherapy, to slow down the blockage process after the stent is treated. Such specially prepared balloons, known as "drug‐eluting balloons," have shown encouraging results for treating patients with artery disease in the leg. 
Review question The goal of this review was to determine how drug‐eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty compares with traditional uncoated balloon angioplasty, also known as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), for the treatment of in‐stent restenosis in stents placed in leg arteries.
