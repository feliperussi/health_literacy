White blood cells reduction in packed red blood cell transfusions for preventing adverse reactions 
Background  A blood transfusion is when blood is taken from one person and given to another person. Blood transfusions are given to solve life and health‐threatening medical conditions on a short‐term basis. However, blood transfusions have adverse events, some of them potentially related to an immune system response or due to the transmission of infectious agents (e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Leukoreduction is a process in which the white blood cells are intentionally removed from donated blood in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions in people receiving the blood transfusion. The benefits of removing white blood cells with the intent of reducing infectious and non‐infectious complications in all types of transfused patients remains unclear. Removing white blood cells is costly. The USA and UK spend tens of millions each year on the procedure. In the USA, the procedure costs approximately USD $30 for each unit of blood product. It may not be worth spending so much money if there is no clear benefit to patients. 
Clinical question  What are the benefits and harms of removing white blood cells from donated blood for people receiving a blood transfusion? 
Study characteristics  We searched medical journals for reports of clinical trials which examined the effects of removing white blood cells from donated blood. We were interested in finding out whether the removal of white blood cells from donated blood resulted in patients receiving a blood transfusion having few complications such as transfusion‐related acute lung injury, death, infectious and non‐infectious complications, or any other adverse event. We included people of any age or sex, who received a blood transfusion for any reason. The evidence is based on studies retrieved up to 05 December 2014.
