Selenium supplements for adults who are critically ill
Selenium is a mineral that is essential to health. It has an important role in defence against tissue damage and disease. Improving selenium status could help protect adults with serious illness. 
In this updated review, Cochrane researchers assessed the effects of additional selenium supplementation for adults recovering from critical illness. We investigated whether the number of people who died changed by giving a selenium supplement during their treatment. Also we checked the impact of such a strategy on the rate of infections and other diseases for these patients while in hospital. We also examined whether selenium affected the duration of respiratory assistance for patients on ventilators and the length of their stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital. 
We included 16 trials with 2084 participants. Thirteen trials carried out tests with selenium while three trials examined selenium‐containing compound ebselen. Overall quality of the included trials was poor, with little information on quality indicators. The results were limited and these trials involving selenium supplementation were mostly small. In most trials, there was a high risk of poor or even incorrect information. Thus the results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is current to 21 May 2014. 
Thirteen trials of intravenous sodium selenite showed a statistically significant effect on death. Three trials of the selenium‐containing compound ebselen showed no effect on death. No effects on infections or secondary diseases were observed. 
No clear evidence emerged for the benefits of selenium or ebselen supplementation for days on a respirator, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay or quality of life. Due to the quality of included trials, one must be cautious when interpreting the strength of the evidence in favour of selenium supplementation despite a statistically significant finding.
