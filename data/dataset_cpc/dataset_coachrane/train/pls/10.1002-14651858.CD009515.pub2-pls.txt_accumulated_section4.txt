Milrinone to prevent reduced heart function and death after heart surgery in children
Background: Children who are born with heart defects often undergo heart surgery at a young age. They are at risk for reduced heart function and death after surgery. Milrinone is a medication that may be used in this situation to make the heart stronger and make it easier for the heart to pump blood into the body. 
Review question: We wanted to examine if the prophylactic use of milrinone prevents reduced heart function or death in babies and children from birth up to 12 years of age having had heart surgery. We planned to consider the number of children who died during the first 30 days after surgery as well as how many days they lived after surgery, followed up for three months. We searched a number of medical literature databases electronically which collect information about planned, ongoing, or finished studies, in order to find trials of this medication published by September 2014. Trials where children had received milrinone and another group of children had received another drug instead after heart surgery were considered. Data were collected by two review authors independently who had to use a pre‚Äêprepared work sheet. 
Study characteristics: We found five studies, and we asked the study authors for more information. Three studies compared milrinone versus levosimendan, one study compared milrinone versus placebo, and one compared milrinone versus dobutamine. The patients were given the study drugs for 24 to 48 hours and were watched for six to 78 days. A total of 393 participants were included.
