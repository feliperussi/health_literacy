Measuring the height of the uterus from the symphysis pubis (SFH) in pregnancy for detecting problems with fetal growth 
Monitoring the baby’s growth is important during pregnancy. If growth is poor then this should be identified as soon as possible, because delay might result in the baby’s death. The simplest way to determine growth is to examine the baby by palpating the mother's by abdomen and estimate the size of her womb compared with a landmark such as the navel (umbilicus). An alternative method is to use a tape measure to take a measurement, known as the symphysial fundal height (SFH) measurement, from the mother’s pubic bone (symphysis pubis) to the top of the womb. The measurement is then applied to the gestation by a simple rule of thumb and compared with normal growth. 
We wanted to know which of these two methods is more likely to detect poor growth. Ultrasound assessment can also be used to detect growth restriction but this is costly and not always available, and there are concerns about its unnecessary use. We found only one randomised trial (involving 1639 women at 20 weeks’ gestation and above) comparing repeated measures of SFH with abdominal palpation. The trial found no difference between the two approaches in detecting poor growth. With such limited evidence, it is still not known whether one method is more effective than the other, and how these methods compare with ultrasound measurement. The main findings from this review were assessed for quality using software called GRADEpro. The overall evidence was of low/very low quality.
