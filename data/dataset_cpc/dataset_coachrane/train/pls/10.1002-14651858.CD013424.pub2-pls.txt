Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.
