Low‐temperature heat via the urethra to treat women with urinary leakage
Review question 
We studied the question of whether using low‐temperature heat via the urethra is safe and helps women with involuntary urinary leakage. We looked for randomised studies comparing this treatment with no treatment or with other treatment forms. 
Background 
Involuntary urinary leakage is a troubling problem that many women face. Many types of treatment are available to help these women, such as changes in behaviour and different types of surgery. Low‐temperature heat via the urethra is a newer form of treatment that can be used to treat women in the office rather than in the operating room. How well this treatment works and how safe it is are not well understood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all randomised controlled trials that studied this form of treatment up to December 2014. We found only one trial of 173 women who were troubled by urinary leakage. On average, these women were 50 years of age. Through random assignment, two‐thirds of them were treated with low‐temperature heat via the urethra; the others did not receive this treatment. Researchers followed these women for 12 months. The makers of this treatment paid for the study. 
Key results 
No information revealed whether more or fewer women complained of urinary leakage at 12 months, or whether there was a difference in the number of women having repeat surgery. The study did not show that quality of life was improved. Evidence was insufficient to show whether there was a difference in serious or minor side effects.
