Pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults
Bottom line 
Moderate‐quality evidence shows that oral pregabalin at doses of 300 mg or 600 mg daily has an important effect on pain in some people with moderate or severe neuropathic pain after shingles, or due to diabetes. Low‐quality evidence suggests that oral pregabalin is effective after trauma due to stroke or spinal cord injury. Pregabalin appears not to be effective in neuropathic pain associated with HIV. Very limited evidence is available for neuropathic back pain, neuropathic cancer pain, and some other forms of neuropathic pain. 
Background 
Neuropathic pain comes from damage to the nervous system. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, from a fall or a cut, or from an arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is often treated by different medicines (drugs) from those used for pain from damaged tissue, which we often think of as painkillers. Medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be effective in some people with neuropathic pain. One of these is pregabalin. Our definition of a good result was a high level of pain relief and ability to keep taking the medicine without side effects making people stop. 
Study characteristics 
In April 2018, for this update we searched for clinical trials that used pregabalin to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found 31 new studies with 8045 participants. In total, we included 45 studies randomising 11,906 participants to treatment with pregabalin, placebo, or other drugs. Studies lasted 2 to 16 weeks. Most studies reported beneficial outcomes that people with neuropathic pain think are important. Results are available mainly for pain after shingles and pain resulting from nerve damage in diabetes.
