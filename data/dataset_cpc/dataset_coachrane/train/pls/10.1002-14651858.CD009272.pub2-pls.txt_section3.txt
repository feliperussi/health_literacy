In normal development of vision, children are able to use the visual information from each of their two eyes to form a single image. When an infant or child's eyes are not properly aligned, this is called strabismus (also known as squint). With misalignment, the two eyes do not work together to relay visual information. The brain may suppress the image that comes from the squinting (weaker) eye in order to perceive a single image. When this happens, the weaker eye may develop into a lazy eye. This is a condition known as amblyopia. Lazy eye can be treated by covering the normal eye (called occlusion therapy) for varying periods of time. This is so that the child is forced to use and strengthen the weaker eye. Treatment continues until the weaker eye reaches normal vision or no change in vision is seen over several follow‐up visits. In the past, we have believed that good, long lasting results could be achieved by surgically aligning the eyes, but only if both eyes had equally good vision before the surgery. So, in children with both squint and lazy eye, this meant delaying squint surgery until the lazy eye had been corrected. However, we also know that for a child to develop three‐dimensional vision with a normal ability to recognize depth (depth perception), the eyes have to be aligned from a very early age. After the age of two to three years, proper three‐dimensional vision fails to develop completely. Although this is not necessarily a major handicap, it can be important because some professions require perfect depth perception.
