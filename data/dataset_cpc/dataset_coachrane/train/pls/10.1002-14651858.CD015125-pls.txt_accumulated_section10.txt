Are inhaled corticosteroids an effective treatment for people with mild COVID‐19?
Key messages 
Inhaled corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given via the oral inhaled route are evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). 
We identified three published studies for people with mild disease. Inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of people going to hospital or death (admission to hospital or death before hospital admission). Inhaled corticosteroids may lower the number of days people have symptoms of mild COVID‐19 and probably increase resolution of COVID‐19 symptoms at day 14. They may make little to no difference in death from any cause, and we do not have enough evidence to know whether they cause serious harms. 
There are no data for people with COVID‐19 with no symptoms (asymptomatic) or people with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19. 
We found 10 ongoing and four completed unpublished studies. We will update this review when their results become available. 
What are inhaled corticosteroids? 
Inhaled corticosteroids are medicines that are breathed into the lower airways through an inhaler where they reduce inflammation in the lungs. They are commonly used to treat respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Long‐term use and incorrect inhaler technique may lead to side effects that include a mouth infection called thrush, a change in voice, and an increased risk of lung infections. Good inhaler technique means the medicine does not stay in the mouth and throat. 
Why are inhaled corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 mainly affects the lungs and airways. When the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed. This inflammation causes breathing difficulties, and the lungs cannot easily move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.
