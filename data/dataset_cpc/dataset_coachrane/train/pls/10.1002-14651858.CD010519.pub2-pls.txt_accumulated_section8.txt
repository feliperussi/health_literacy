Lifestyle interventions for treating acute gout attacks
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of lifestyle modifications in the treatment of people with acute gout. There was one study included in this review, which looked at the benefits and safety of adding topical ice therapy to medications commonly used for treating acute gout (prednisolone and colchicine). Over a one week period, in addition to prednisolone and colchicine, ice was applied to the skin overlying the joints affected by acute gout, for half‐an‐hour, four times per day, to relieve symptoms of pain and warmth and to reduce signs of redness and swelling. 
The review shows that in people with acute gout: 
We are uncertain whether the reduction in pain seen with the addition of topical ice to standard treatment of prednisolone and colchicine, compared to prednisolone and colchicine alone, is a true effect because of the very low quality evidence. 
Joint function, health‐related quality of life, patient global assessment and side effects and complications were not reported. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Topical ice is likely to be a safe intervention. 
What is gout and what are lifestyle interventions? 
Gout is a very common cause of painful joint inflammation (arthritis) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. The inflammation can lead to pain, redness, warmth and swelling of the affected joints, making the area difficult to touch or move. Some of the reasons why people get gout include their genetic make‐up, being overweight, ingesting certain medications (for example cyclosporine), having impaired kidney function, and lifestyle habits such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and sugar‐sweetened drinks.
