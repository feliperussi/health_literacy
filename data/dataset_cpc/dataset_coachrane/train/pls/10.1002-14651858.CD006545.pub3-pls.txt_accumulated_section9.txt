Treatments for haemangiomas (a cluster of small blood vessels that form a lump) of the skin in children 
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of treatments for haemangiomas of the skin in infants and children (known as 'infantile haemangiomas'). We collected and analysed 28 relevant clinical trials to answer this question. 
Key messages 
Only one of our key comparisons (propranolol versus placebo) measured clearance of the haemangioma, with moderate‐quality evidence supporting this result. We found low‐ or moderate‐quality evidence for the following specific measures of resolution: reduction in volume, redness, and size. We found very low‐ and low‐quality evidence for results concerning side effects, meaning we were unable to draw definitive conclusions about safety. 
Oral propranolol is currently the standard treatment for this condition, and we did not find evidence to contest this treatment in terms of efficacy and safety. However, potential biases in the design of many of the included trials affect our confidence in the results of the review. High‐quality future research should assess the effects of propranolol and timolol maleate, as well as other new and older medications, on outcomes that are important to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Infantile haemangiomas are soft, raised swellings on the skin, often with a bright‐red surface caused by a non‐cancerous overgrowth of blood vessels in the skin. The majority of lesions are uncomplicated and will shrink on their own by age seven; however, some require treatment if they occur in high‐risk areas (e.g. near the eyes) or cause psychological distress. 
We included all types of treatment for infantile haemangiomas, which could have been given alone or in combination, or compared to each other, to a 'placebo' (i.e. a treatment with no active agent), or against children whose haemangiomas were untreated but observed.
