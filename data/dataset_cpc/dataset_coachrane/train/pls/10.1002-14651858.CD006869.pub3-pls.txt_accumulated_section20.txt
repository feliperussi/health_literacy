Multiple session early psychological interventions for prevention of post‐traumatic stress disorder 
Why was this review important? 
Traumatic events can have a significant effect on the ability of individuals, families and communities to cope. In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties. However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions have not been effective at preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to prevent people exposed to trauma from developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
• People exposed to traumatic events and their loved ones.
• Professionals working in mental health services.
• General practitioners.
• Commissioners.
What questions did this review try to answer? 
Are multiple session early psychological interventions (i.e. interventions over two or more sessions beginning within the first three months after the traumatic event) more effective than treatment as usual or another psychological intervention in: 
• reducing the number of people diagnosed with PTSD;
• reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms;
• reducing the severity of depressive symptoms;
• reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms;
• improving the general functioning (e.g. social, psychological, occupational and functioning) of recipients of the intervention. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that examined multiple session early psychological interventions in the prevention of PTSD, published between 1970 and March 2018. 
We included 27 studies with 3963 participants.
What did the evidence from the review tell us? 
• We found low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be more effective than treatment as usual in preventing PTSD diagnosis three to six months after receiving the intervention.
