Local and regional anaesthesia at the time of surgery to prevent longer‐term persistent pain after surgery 
Review question 
We set out to determine if the use of local anaesthetics (numbing medicine) at the time of surgery reduces the risk of having pain that persists for three months and more after surgery. The comparison was with pain killers alone, such as opioids and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. 
Background 
Pain that persists long after surgery is called persistent postoperative pain (PPP), and is not uncommon. Tissue damage and nerve injury can change pain pathways and sensibility to pain so that pain persists for months. A person may also feel pain more intensely or with a stimulus that normally is not perceived as pain. These changes can be permanent. Applying local anaesthetics close to nerves, bundles of nerves, or nerve roots in the central nervous system, as with an epidural, can interrupt the conduction of pain impulses from the surgical site to the central nervous system. Effective treatment of acute pain may prevent PPP. Wound infiltration uses a specially designed tube with multiple holes that is placed inside the wound to deliver the local anaesthetic. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to December 2016. We found 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants undergoing open chest, heart, breast, abdominal, vascular, gynaecological and other surgery, but not orthopaedic surgery. RCTs are studies where people are allocated by chance to one or the other of different treatments being studied. The studies included only adults, and were mostly conducted in Europe and North America, with some from China, Egypt and Brazil. The types of surgery included surgery with a high event rate of persistent pain after surgery, such as breast surgery, limb amputation and opening the chest, and surgery with a lower risk but high numbers of procedures, such as caesarean section.
