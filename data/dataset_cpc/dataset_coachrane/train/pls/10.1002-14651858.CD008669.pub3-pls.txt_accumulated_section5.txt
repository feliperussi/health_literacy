Tonsillectomy for PFAPA syndrome (a rare cause of recurrent fever, mouth ulcers, sore throat and swollen neck glands) 
Background 
Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is a rare cause of regular, repeated episodes of fever, sore throat and swollen neck glands in children. It is a diagnosis that needs confirmation by paediatricians working in centres with expertise in this condition and most children who suffer from repeated sore throats and tonsillitis will not have it. This review compared the clinical effectiveness and safety of removing the palatine tonsils (tonsillectomy), with and without removal of the adenoids, against non‐surgical management of children with PFAPA syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for and included any randomised controlled trials published up to October 2019. We found two small randomised controlled trials, with a low risk of bias, comparing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy against non‐surgical interventions (total of 67 participants, with data from 65 analysed). One study (39 participants) used the adenotonsillectomy procedure in the intervention group and followed up patients for 18 months. This study applied stringent criteria for diagnosing PFAPA when recruiting patients. The other trial (28 participants) only removed the tonsils and followed up patients for up to six months. Less stringent recruitment criteria were applied and it was possible that patients with other types of recurrent sore throats might have been recruited and included in the trial. Neither study masked participants and investigators to the type of treatment received. Participants in the control groups of both studies received standard medical treatment.
