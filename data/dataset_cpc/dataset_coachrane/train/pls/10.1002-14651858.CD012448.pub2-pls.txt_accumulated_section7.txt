TNF‐α blockers intervention compared to placebo or additional treatment for children with Kawasaki disease 
Background
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute inflammation of the blood vessels that mainly affects children between six months and five years of age. Standard medical management of KD includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with aspirin. This standard treatment is usually effective, but doesn't work for approximately 15% to 20% of children. When treatment is not effective, children may suffer from serious heart disease. Recently, researchers found that tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) blockers may be effective for children with Kawasaki disease that has not been cured by standard treatment. However, we are still unclear about the benefits and risks of TNF‐α blockers for the treatment of KD, and the potential for improved efficacy and safety is ambiguous. This review therefore assessed the benefits and harms of TNF‐α blockers for the treatment of KD. 
Study characteristics
We included trials that used TNF‐α blockers as a treatment for children with KD and measured treatment resistance, cardiovascular events and side effects, such as infusion reactions and infections, or other symptoms. We found five completed studies with a total of 494 participants (most recent search for studies September 2018). Four studies used TNF‐α blockers as the additional treatment after IVIG treatment and one used TNF‐α blockers as the first treatment for children with KD. 
Key results
The analyses showed that TNF‐α blockers might reduce treatment resistance by 14% to 62% (low‐certainty evidence) and infusion reactions by 55% to 99% (low‐certainty evidence). It was not clear whether or not TNF‐α blockers were effective in reducing serious heart diseases such as coronary artery abnormalities. There was also no clear difference in the incidence of infections between children who did or didn't receive TNF‐α blockers.
