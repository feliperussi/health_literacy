Respiratory muscle training in children and adults with neuromuscular disease
Review question 
Does respiratory muscle training have beneficial effects for children and adults with neuromuscular disease? 
Background 
Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that covers many diseases that either directly or indirectly affect muscles or nerves. Children and adults with neuromuscular diseases can present with muscle weakness, loss of movement control, and muscle wasting. Some neuromuscular diseases cause weakness of respiratory muscles (diaphragm and accessory muscles of respiration). The decline of respiratory muscle function in these diseases affects activities of daily living and quality of life. Respiratory muscle training could potentially be considered as an extra therapy for people with suspected or confirmed respiratory muscle weakness. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 11 studies with a total of 250 randomized participants with neuromuscular disease. Six studies included 112 young males (including children) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is an inherited muscle disease. One trial involved 23 adults with other muscle diseases (Becker muscular dystrophy and limb‚Äêgirdle muscular dystrophy). Three trials involved 88 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive condition that affects the nerves controlling movement. One trial involved 27 people with myasthenia gravis, a condition that affects the signals between nerves and muscles. 
Key results 
The studies showed that respiratory muscle training may result in some improvements in lung function for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, this finding was not consistent between studies. Physical function and quality of life were only assessed in one amyotrophic lateral sclerosis trial, which indicated that RMT may have no clear effect. One trial reported on adverse events, but the certainty of evidence was too low for conclusions to be drawn. The studies did not report the number of unscheduled hospitalisations for sudden infection or worsening of chronic respiratory failure.
