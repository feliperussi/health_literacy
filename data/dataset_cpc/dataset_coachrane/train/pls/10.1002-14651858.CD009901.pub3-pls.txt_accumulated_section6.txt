Laryngeal mask airway versus endotracheal tube for percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy in critically ill adults 
Review question 
We compared different ways of securing patients' airways so that the patients can continue to be ventilated during planned opening of the trachea. This procedure is needed for adults hospitalized for a length of time in an intensive care unit (ICU) and continuing to require artificial ventilation. The use of a laryngeal mask airway was compared with the existing endotracheal tube in terms of the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. 
Background 
Critically ill adults in an ICU often require mechanical ventilation to help them to breathe. Initially they are ventilated using an endotracheal tube (ETT) placed in the trachea (windpipe). Patients receiving long‚Äêterm ventilation may require a tracheostomy with the breathing tube placed directly into the trachea to avoid damage to the trachea and larynx by the ETT. An opening in the neck and trachea (tracheostoma) is created and a tracheostomy tube is then inserted into this opening to ventilate the patient. This procedure is known as percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) and is one of the most common interventional bedside procedures performed in the ICU. PDT uses a cannula to puncture through the skin to reach the trachea, followed by widening (dilatation) of this access to place a tracheostomy tube in the trachea. 
PDT enters a critical stage when the tracheal cannula is inserted and the previous means of breathing, through the ETT, is loosened in the trachea and then removed. Several complications can occur at this stage.
