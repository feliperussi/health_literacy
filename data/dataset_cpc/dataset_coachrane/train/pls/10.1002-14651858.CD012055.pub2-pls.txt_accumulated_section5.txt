Alternative agents instead of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding for people who have bone marrow disorders and low platelet counts 
Review question 
We evaluated the evidence about whether giving agents that can replace, or reduce platelet transfusion (artificial platelets, platelet‐poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII), recombinant interleukin (rIL)6 or rIL11, desmopressin (DDAVP), thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics or antifibrinolytic drugs), to people with a low platelet count prevents bleeding and whether these alternative agents are associated with side effects. Our target population was people with bone marrow disorders which prevent them from producing enough platelets. We excluded people undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. 
Background 
People with low platelet counts due to bone marrow disorders are vulnerable to bleeding which may be severe or life‐threatening. In order to treat, or prevent bleeding, they are often given platelet transfusions. However, platelet transfusions are associated with risks such as infection and transfusion reactions. Consequently, there is interest in whether it is possible to use alternative treatments to prevent bleeding. These treatments include: man‐made platelets (artificial platelets); stimulating the person's body to produce more platelets (recombinant interleukin (rIL)6, rIL11, TPO mimetics); increasing the levels of proteins in the blood that help the body to form a clot (platelet‐poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII)); and preventing a blood clot from breaking down (antifibrinolytics) There may be risks associated with agents that prevent bleeding; the most important being an increased risk of forming unwanted blood clots, which could be potentially life‐threatening.
