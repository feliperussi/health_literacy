Exercise‐based rehabilitation in pulmonary hypertension
What is pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs is elevated well above normal. Often with a gradual onset, it affects individuals of all ages, significantly reduces quality of life and results in premature death. 
Bottom Line. We reviewed randomised controlled trials to determine whether exercise training improved short‐ and long‐term patient outcomes in people with pulmonary hypertension. The number of participants in randomised controlled trials of exercise‐based rehabilitation for pulmonary hypertension was relatively small. These studies all reported large increases in exercise capacity as evaluated by six‐minute walk distance, maximal oxygen consumption and peak power. Health‐related quality of life was also improved, but to a lesser extent. Serious adverse events were rare with only one report of a participant being required to stop exercise training due to feeling lightheaded. There were no reports of death or other adverse events with exercise training. 
What evidence did we find and how good was it? The review included six studies on 206 people with pulmonary hypertension and we could combine data from five of these studies. We could only use data for 165 participants, however not all of these data could be included in the analysis for all outcome measures. The majority of studies implemented an inpatient exercise rehabilitation programme with only a small number of studies examining an outpatient programme. The methods used to conduct these trials were of low quality. Given this low‐quality evidence, it was not possible to generalise the results of this review across the spectrum of people with pulmonary hypertension.
