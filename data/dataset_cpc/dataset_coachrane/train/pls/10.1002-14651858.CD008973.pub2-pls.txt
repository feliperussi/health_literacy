Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys
Phimosis is a condition where the foreskin cannot be fully drawn back (retracted) over the penis. Phimosis is normal at birth and often self‐corrects without needing treatment during the first three to four years of life; only 10% of three year old boys have phimosis. This is known as congenital phimosis. Phimosis can also be caused by scarring of the skin protecting the head of the penis that is caused when the foreskin cannot be retracted. Phimosis caused by scarring is estimated to occur among 0.6% to 1.5% of boys less than 18 years of age, but this type of phimosis seldom occurs among boys under five years of age. Making a distinction between types of phimosis can sometimes be difficult. 
Treatment for boys with phimosis has become controversial. Operations to remove or widen the foreskin (circumcision and prepuce plasty) have been widely used in the past to treat phimosis. More recently, creams and ointments containing corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation limit or stop immune system activity) that are applied for four to eight weeks have shown promising results. The aim of topical corticosteroid treatment is to reduce skin tightening around the tip of the penis. This offers a much less invasive form of treatment and may limit the need for surgery among some boys. 
We assessed the effects of topical corticosteroids to treat phimosis in boys aged up to 18 years compared with non‐active treatment (placebo) or no treatment at all. We analysed 12 studies that included 1395 boys aged between 18 days and 17 years, and although we found that topical corticosteroids may increase the likelihood of full or partial resolution of phimosis without significant adverse effects, many studies did not report adverse events. 
Topical corticosteroids may be a safe alternative to treat phimosis in boys before undergoing surgical treatment.
