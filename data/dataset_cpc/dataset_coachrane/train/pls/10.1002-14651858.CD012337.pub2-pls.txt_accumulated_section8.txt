Conservative interventions for urinary incontinence in women: an overview of Cochrane Reviews 
What is urinary incontinence? 
Bladder problems are common in women. Having to go to the toilet frequently, urgently and sometimes not making it in time is called urgency urinary incontinence. Urgency urinary incontinence occurs when, for some reason, the signals telling women to empty their bladder are much stronger and occur more often than necessary. Leaking when sneezing or exercising is called stress urinary incontinence, and can happen if the muscles controlling the outlet from the bladder are weaker than they should be. Women can also have a mixture of these two conditions, which is called mixed urinary incontinence. 
Symptoms of bladder problems can cause a lot of distress. For example, women can often be reluctant to go out and may fear going for walks or taking part in exercise classes. Often these women can feel isolated and their quality of life is significantly poorer compared to women without bladder symptoms. 
How is urinary incontinence treated? 
Treatment options for urinary incontinence mainly include 'conservative treatment' (avoiding invasive methods), medication and surgery. Conservative treatments should be offered first and these include training of the pelvic floor muscle (muscle between the tail bone (coccyx) and public bone that support the bladder, bowel, vagina, and womb) (with and without add‚Äêon treatments such as electrical stimulation), bladder training and devices. These are usually provided by physiotherapists or nurses who have had specialist training. 
What did we aim to do? 
There are a growing number of Cochrane Reviews relating to conservative management for different types of urinary incontinence, and our aim was to bring together these research findings into one accessible overview document, with input from clinicians and women affected by incontinence.
