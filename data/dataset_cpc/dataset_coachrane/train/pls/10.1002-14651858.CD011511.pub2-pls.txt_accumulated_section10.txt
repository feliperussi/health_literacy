Vitamin D to prevent asthma attacks
Review question 
Does vitamin D prevent asthma attacks or improve control of asthma symptoms or both?
Background 
Low blood levels of vitamin D (the 'sunshine vitamin') have been linked to an increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. Several clinical trials have been conducted to test whether vitamin D might prevent asthma attacks and improve control of asthma symptoms in children and adults, but results from studies with the most scientifically sound designs have not previously been evaluated as a group. 
Included studies 
We included seven trials involving 435 children and two trials involving 658 adults in the review from searches run up to January 2016. Of these, one trial involving 22 children and two trials involving 658 adults contributed to the analysis of the rate of severe asthma attacks. Study duration ranged from four to 12 months, and the majority of those taking part had mild or moderate asthma. All of the studies compared vitamin D with placebo. 
Key results 
People given vitamin D experienced fewer asthma attacks needing treatment with oral steroids. The average number of attacks per person per year went down from 0.44 to 0.28 with vitamin D (high‐quality evidence). Vitamin D reduced the risk of attending hospital with an acute asthma attack from 6 per 100 to around 3 per 100 (high‐quality evidence). 
Vitamin D had little or no effect on lung function or day‐to‐day asthma symptoms (high‐quality evidence). We found that vitamin D did not increase the risk of serious adverse events at the doses that were tested (moderate‐quality evidence).
