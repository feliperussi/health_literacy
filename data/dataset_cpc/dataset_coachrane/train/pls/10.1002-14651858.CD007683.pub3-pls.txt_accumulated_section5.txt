Managing acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age
Review question: Cochrane authors reviewed available evidence on the use of laparoscopy to manage acute lower abdominal pain, non‚Äêspecific lower abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis in women of childbearing age. We found 12 studies. 
Background: Acute lower abdominal pain is a common occurrence among women of childbearing age and frequently results in referral to hospital because clarifying the cause of the pain is often difficult. Probable diagnoses include ovulation pain, ovarian cysts, pelvic infection, ectopic pregnancy and appendicitis. Many women end up having their appendices removed unnecessarily. It has been suggested that visualisation of the pelvic cavity through laparoscopy could be useful in the management of women such as these. 
Study characteristics: Twelve studies were identified with 1020 women from 11 countries. Eight studies compared laparoscopy versus open appendicectomy, and four compared laparoscopy using a wait and see approach. The evidence is current to October 2013. 
Key result: In this review of randomised controlled trials, laparoscopy was found to be superior to both open appendicectomy alone and a wait and see strategy, as more specific diagnoses were made before discharge, and shorter hospital stays and earlier return to work (when compared with open appendicectomy only) were reported. No evidence was found of an increase in adverse events when any of these strategies was applied. The rate of removal of normal appendices was reduced with the laparoscopic approach compared with open appendicectomy but was greater when a laparoscopic approach was compared with a wait and see strategy.
