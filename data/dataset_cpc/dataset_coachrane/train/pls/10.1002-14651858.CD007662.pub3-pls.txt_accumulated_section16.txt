Drug treatments for chronic hair‐pulling (trichotillomania)
Trichotillomania (TTM) is a common and disabling condition characterised by repeated hair‐pulling leading to hair loss. TTM can be associated with much distress and impairment. It may also be associated with other psychiatric conditions (known as comorbidities) such as depression and anxiety disorders. Researchers have proposed that medication may be useful to treat this condition.
