Band ligation versus beta‐blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children 
Background 
Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins (a type of blood vessel) called the portal venous system, which drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and spleen into the liver. Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage (bleeding) from oesophageal (gullet) and gastrointestinal varices (enlarged or swollen veins). 
Following numerous randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) demonstrating the effectiveness of medicines called non‐selective beta‐blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation (where an enlarged vein is tied off or ligated by a rubber band) in decreasing the incidence of variceal haemorrhage, treatment to prevent of variceal haemorrhage in adults (called primary prophylaxis) has become the established standard of care. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted a systematic review of randomised clinical trials to assess the benefits and harms of band ligation versus beta‐blockers for prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis (blockage or narrowing of the portal vein (the blood vessel that brings blood to the liver from the intestines) by a blood clot). We searched for studies to 26 December 2018. 
Key results 
We found no randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this systematic review. Accordingly, we lack study results from randomised clinical trials to conclude if band ligation versus beta‐blocker may be beneficial or not in children with oesophageal varices. There is a need for well‐designed trials that should include important clinical outcomes such as death, failure to control bleeding, and side effects.
