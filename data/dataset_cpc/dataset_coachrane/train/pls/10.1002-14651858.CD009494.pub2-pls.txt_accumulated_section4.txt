Endovenous thermal ablation for treating venous leg ulcers
The veins of the leg are designed to return blood from the leg upwards towards the heart. Blood is under the force of gravity and, left to itself, would flow downwards. Valves within the veins normally prevent blood from flowing downwards (i.e. backwards), however, if these valves become leaky, pressure within the veins increases. This high pressure causes swelling, thickening and damage to skin, which may break down to form ulcers. Venous leg ulcers are associated with pain and mobility restrictions that affect quality of life. 
Compression of legs with bandages or medical stockings helps to move the blood upwards, and reduces pressure in the veins and tissues. This treatment has been shown to improve ulcer healing. Compression is unpopular because it can be uncomfortable, and only provides a benefit while the bandages or hosiery are worn. Even with compression treatment, healing of venous ulcers may still take a long time, and ulcers often come back. 
Traditionally, surgery for venous disease involves removing the veins from the leg. The blood is then diverted through the remaining healthy veins. This reduces the pressure in the veins and helps prevent ulcers that have healed from coming back. Generally, this surgery is performed under a general anaesthetic and involves a period of recovery. Some people, particularly the elderly, are less suitable for general anaesthetic and may be at risk of age‚Äêrelated complications or a prolonged and difficult recovery. Newer 'keyhole' surgical techniques destroy the veins with heat, and require only local anaesthesia. These treatments have been shown to be as effective as surgery in the treatment of varicose veins in the absence of ulcers, and result in less pain than traditional surgery. Since a general anaesthetic can be avoided, there is also a reduced risk associated with the anaesthetic procedure, and the recovery period is shorter.
