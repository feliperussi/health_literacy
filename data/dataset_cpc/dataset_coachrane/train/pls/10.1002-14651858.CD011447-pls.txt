Ultrasound guidance versus anatomical landmarks for subclavian or femoral vein catheterization
People who are critically ill sometimes need a central venous catheter to help with diagnosis and treatment. The catheter may be placed in a large vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), upper chest (subclavian/axillary vein) or groin (femoral vein). However, this procedure carries risks such as arterial puncture and other complications and should be performed with as few attempts as possible. Traditionally, anatomical ‘landmarks’ on the body surface were used to find the correct place to insert catheters, but ultrasound imaging is now available. 
This Cochrane systematic review compared landmark techniques versus ultrasound guidance. The evidence is current to´January 2013. We included in the review 13 studies enrolling 2341 participants (and involving 2360 procedures). The studies were varied, and their quality was not high. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. Nevertheless, ultrasound offered some benefits, as it reduced the risk of arterial puncture and severe bruising in subclavian vein catheterization. Fewer data were available for femoral vein catheterization, but success rates seemed to be higher with ultrasound. No evidence showed a significant difference in complication rates or in time taken to cannulate at either site. 
On the basis of available data, we conclude that two‐dimensional ultrasound offers small advantages in safety and quality when compared with an anatomical landmark technique for subclavian vein (reduced arterial puncture and haematoma formation) or femoral vein (reduced success on the first attempt) cannulation for central vein catheterization, but these findings do not necessarily hold for all groups of ultrasound users or for patients at high risk for complications. The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are uncertain.
