Guided imagery for treating hypertension in pregnancy
What is the issue? 
Some women have long‐term high blood pressure, or hypertension, whereas approximately 10% of pregnant women develop high blood pressure as a complication of pregnancy. Guided imagery is a mind‐body therapy that involves the visualisation of various mental images to facilitate relaxation and reduction in blood pressure. It can be performed by oneself, one‐to‐one, or in groups with an instructor using audio or scripts. 
Why is this important? 
High blood pressure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of the mother developing pre‐eclampsia with proteinuria, eclampsia with seizures and liver and blood disorders, and kidney failure. The baby of a pregnant woman with high blood pressure is more likely to be born too soon, be too small, and may need neonatal intensive care. High blood pressure drugs are recommended for women with severe high blood pressure and pre‐eclampsia because of the risk of life‐threatening complications, but such drugs can have adverse effects for the mother (including headache, decreased mental alertness, and exercise intolerance). Such drugs can also cross the placenta and may affect the unborn baby, and are not generally recommended for pregnant women with mild to moderate high blood pressure, which is when other ways of managing blood pressure are sought. 
Guided imagery is a non‐pharmacological technique that could potentially lower blood pressure among pregnant women with hypertension and improve pregnancy outcomes for the mother and her baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (October 2018) and found two trials (involving 99 women) conducted in Canada and the USA. Both trials compared guided imagery with quiet rest. There were no trials comparing guided imagery with no intervention, or other with another non‐pharmacological method for hypertension.
