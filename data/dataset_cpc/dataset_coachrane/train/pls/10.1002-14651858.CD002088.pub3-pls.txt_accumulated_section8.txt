Interventions for speech problems (dysarthria) after stroke or other non‐progressive brain injury 
Review question  Does any type of treatment help people who have difficulty speaking clearly after a stroke or other types of brain injury acquired during adulthood? 
Background  Brain damage caused by stroke, injury or other non‐progressive disease can make speech unclear and difficult for listeners to understand. This condition is known as dysarthria and it occurs when face, tongue, and throat muscles are weak, slow, and unco‐ordinated. Dysarthria can cause people who are affected to lose confidence when talking and become socially isolated, even if others see symptoms as mild. People with dysarthria do not have difficulties thinking, remembering, or retrieving words. 
Treatment is usually provided by a speech and language therapist or speech pathologist and involves advice and education plus strategies and exercises to increase clarity of speech and to cope with social interaction. Other types of treatment used include acupuncture or brain stimulation. 
We wanted to find out if any treatments work, if the effects are long lasting, and if so, which works best, when treatment should start, how frequent treatment should be, and for how long. To find out we searched for, evaluated, and summarised the quality of the existing research on this topic. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to May 2016.
Study characteristics  We included five small trials that randomised only 234 people, almost all with stroke. Two trials investigated dysarthria treatment versus an attention control and three compared one treatment with usual care. There were no trials that compared one treatment to no treatment.
