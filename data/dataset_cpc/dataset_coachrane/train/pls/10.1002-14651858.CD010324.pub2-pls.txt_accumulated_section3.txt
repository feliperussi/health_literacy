Treatment options for Gaucher disease
Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, is caused by inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This defect leads to the build‚Äêup of a fatty material called glucocerebroside in various cells in the body. Untreated individuals may suffer from anaemia, a decrease in platelet counts, massive enlargement of the liver and spleen, and damage to the bones. Two different types of treatment are available: the intravenous supplementation of the deficient protein glucocerebrosidase (enzyme replacement therapy), or the oral administration of a drug that slows down the production of the fatty material that it normally breaks down (substrate reduction therapy). 
Although there are many published studies about treatment of Gaucher disease, those that are based on randomized controlled clinical studies are considered to provide the strongest evidence. Eight such studies (300 participants) were identified by systematically reviewing the medical literature. Potential risks of bias in the methods employed in the original studies and in the data reported were assessed; only one study scored 'low' in all bias domains. Six evaluated the possible beneficial effects on the disease by enzyme replacement therapy using different products, doses or frequencies of administration; two studies examined the effects of substrate reduction therapy. Owing to different study methods and data formats, the original results could not be pooled or combined in order to obtain summary measures of efficacy. Our analysis, despite being limited by the small number of studies, suggests that, at least during the first year of treatment, different enzyme replacement therapy drugs appear to have a similar safety profile and all improve some of the most obvious manifestations of the disease.
