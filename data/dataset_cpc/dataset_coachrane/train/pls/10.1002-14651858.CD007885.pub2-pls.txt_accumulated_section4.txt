Intramuscular versus intravenous anti‐D for preventing Rhesus alloimmunization during pregnancy 
Antibodies to the red cell Rhesus D (RhD) antigen may be produced by a RhD‐negative mother if she is carrying a RhD‐positive baby. Antibodies form with the entry of fetal blood into the maternal circulation (feto‐maternal haemorrhage) at birth or following a procedure (such as amniocentesis). Spontaneous sensitisation occurs antenatally at about 28 to 30 weeks gestation. The maternal condition that results from this is known as RhD alloimmunization or sensitization. The antibodies can cause haemolytic disease in the baby resulting in anaemia, oedema and possible death. While the first baby is usually not harmed, the antibodies (directed against antigens inherited from the father) may cause haemolytic disease in subsequent RhD‐positive babies. 
Anti‐D (anti‐D immunoglobulin G) is obtained from human plasma and contains high levels of antibody to the fetal RhD antigens. Following administration to the mother, a positive antibody screen is found as the anti‐D crosses the placenta and binds to the fetal red blood cells. Since andi‐D is derived from pooled donor plasma, there is a risk of transmission of blood‐borne diseases. 
Anti‐D immunoprophylaxis is recommended for RhD‐negative mothers at 28 or 30 weeks of pregnancy and within 72 hours of potential maternal exposure to fetal red cells to prevent the mother developing antibodies during the pregnancy. RhD negative mothers also receive postpartum anti‐D after a RhD‐positive baby to reduce the risk of sensitization during the next pregnancy. Present routes of administration for this product include intramuscular of intravenous routes. This review aimed to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of intramuscular versus intravenous anti‐D in preventing rhesus alloimmunization in RhD‐negative pregnant women.
