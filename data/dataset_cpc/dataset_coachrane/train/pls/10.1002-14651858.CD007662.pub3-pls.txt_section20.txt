There was insufficient evidence from analysis of individual studies or across multiple scientific studies (known as meta‐analysis) to confirm or refute the effectiveness of any specific agent or class of medication for the treatment of TTM in adults, children or adolescents. In adults, evidence suggests tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; a type of antidepressant) with predominantly serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; increasing serotonin levels in the brain) actions may show a beneficial treatment effect compared to other TCAs, with reduction in TTM symptom severity. However, certainty in the estimate of effect was low and is based on a single trial comparing clomipramine with desipramine. Antipsychotics in adults may show a beneficial treatment effect and possible reduction of TTM symptom severity, with low‐certainty in the estimate of effect, based on a single trial of olanzapine. Glutamate modulators (a type of amino acid modulator) in adults showed a probable beneficial treatment effect and a likely reduction in TTM symptom severity, with moderate‐certainty in the estimate of effect, although based on a single trial of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC; a glutamate modulator). Glutamate modulators in children and adolescents (8 to 17 years old) showed no evidence for beneficial effect in terms of the percentage of participants responding to treatment in a single study of NAC. However, evidence suggests a potential large reduction in TTM symptom severity; however, with low‐certainty in the estimate. There was little to no evidence for beneficial treatment effects in terms of the percentage of participants responding to treatment or reduction of TTM symptom severity reported for antioxidants, cell signal transducers, opioid antagonists or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; a type of antidepressant) in adults, children or adolescents.
