Skin grafting and tissue replacement for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
Background 
Foot ulceration is a major problem in people with diabetes and is the leading cause of hospital admissions and limb amputations. Despite the current variety of strategies available for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes, not all ulcers heal completely. Additional treatments with skin grafts and tissue replacement products have been developed to help complete wound closure. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of skin grafting and tissue replacement for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes? 
What we found 
We included thirteen randomised studies that compared two types of skin grafts or tissue replacements with standard care and four randomised studies that compared two grafts or tissue replacements with each other. In total 1655 patients were randomised in these seventeen trials. Risk of bias was variable among studies. The biggest drawbacks were the lack of blinding (i.e. patients and investigators were aware who was receiving the experimental therapy and who was receiving the standard therapy), industry involvement and the possibility that small studies were less likely to be published if they reported 'negative' results. Adverse advent rates (harm due to the treatment) varied widely. 
Conclusion 
Based on the seventeen studies included in this review, skin grafts and tissue replacements, used in conjunction with standard care, increase the healing rate of foot ulcers and lead to slightly fewer amputations in people with diabetes compared with standard care alone. However, evidence of long term effectiveness is lacking and cost‐effectiveness is uncertain. There was not enough evidence for us to be able to recommend a specific type of skin graft or tissue replacement.
