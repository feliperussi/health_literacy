Do blood thinner injections given after abdominal surgery further reduce blood clots if continued after discharge from the hospital? 
Review question 
For persons having surgery on the abdomen and pelvis, does continuing blood thinner injections after discharge from a hospital stay decrease the likelihood of developing a blood clot in the lower limbs or lungs when compared to usual treatment in the hospital? 
Why is this important? 
The complication of developing a blood clot can range from asymptomatic to potentially fatal, depending on the location and severity of the clot. After a postoperative patient is considered safe for discharge from the hospital, evidence suggests an ongoing risk for developing a blood clot in the weeks to months following the operation. Although recommended by some guidelines, not all physicians recommend discharging a postoperative patient home with a prolonged course of blood thinner injections. 
What was found? 
Seven studies were found that addressed this question, including a total of 1728 patients. Continuing blood thinning injections after hospital discharge decreased the risk of both blood clots in the limbs and in the lungs. This review determined that the overall incidence of having a blood clot is reduced from 13.2%, when no post‐discharge blood thinner injections are used, to 5.3% when a blood thinner injection is prescribed for at least 14 days following discharge in 30 days follow‐up. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic blood clots decreased with the use of prolonged duration blood thinner injections in postoperative patients. No increase in bleeding complications or death, common concerns when blood thinners are used, were observed in patients treated with prolonged duration blood thinner injections.
