Anticholinergic therapy for acute asthma in children
Asthma is a condition that affects the airways (tubes carrying air in and out of the lungs). During an asthma exacerbation (attack), the airways narrow and drugs can be taken to dilate, or widen, the airways. Common bronchodilators (medicines used to widen the airways) are short‐acting beta2‐ agonists (e.g. salbutamol) or anticholinergics (e.g. ipratropium bromide). In this review, we examined if the use of anticholinergic inhalers during an asthma attack in children aged over two years is effective compared to either placebo or another bronchodilator. We also looked at combinations of anticholinergic plus a beta2‐agonist compared to an anticholinergic on its own. 
We found six small trials of unclear quality answering these two questions. We found data from four trials on 171 children comparing anticholinergics with beta2‐agonists. Children on anticholinergics alone were significantly more likely to experience treatment failure than those on beta2‐agonists (odds ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.75). We also found data from four trials on 173 children comparing children on anticholinergics alone with children on anticholinergics plus beta2‐agonists. In this case, treatment failure was more likely in children taking anticholinergics only than if they were combined with beta2‐agonists (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.2 to 5.88). We were only able to combine data for treatment failure and hospitalisation. 
In summary, we found that inhaled anticholinergics used on their own are less effective than inhaled beta2‐agonists used alone or in combination with anticholinergics. Inhaled anticholinergics seem safe, with no significant side effects apparent.
