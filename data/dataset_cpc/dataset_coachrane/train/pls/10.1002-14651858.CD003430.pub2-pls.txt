Does dietary fibre prevent the recurrence of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas?
We asked 
Does nutritional supplement of dietary fibre prevent recurrence of precancerous polyps and cancer in the bowel in participants with a history of polyps having been removed to achieve a polyp‐free colon at baseline for the intervention. 
Background 
Colorectal (bowel) cancer is common worldwide but is especially prevalent in industrialised countries. Genes, diet and lifestyle all seem to be important in the development of bowel cancer. Several communities with low bowel cancer rates have diets that are rich in fibre. Increasing the levels of fibre in the diet in industrialised countries might therefore help to reduce the rate of bowel cancer.

Study characteristics 
Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. However, only five studies with 4798 participants provided data for this review. The mean ages of the participants ranged from 56 to 66 years. The participants all had a history of adenomas and would have had at least one procedure to remove them to achieve a polyp‐free colon at baseline.The interventions in the included studies were wheat bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high fibre whole food sources used alone or in combination. These were compared to low‐fibre (2 to 3 g per day), placebo, or a regular diet. 
Key results 
This review found that increasing fibre in a Western diet for two to eight years did not lower the risk of bowel cancer. Paradoxically, after four years participants receiving dietary fibre had higher rates of bowel cancer compared with the control group, with the absolute increase in risk being one percent. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was low. The high risk of bias of included studies, small sample size, large number of missing data and the use of indirect measures gave us little confidence on the findings of this review.
