Surgical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps
Background 
Benign nasal polyps are abnormal tissue growths inside the nasal passages and sinuses, often on both sides of the nose. They can cause a wide array of symptoms including blocked nose, poor sense of smell that can lead to a loss of taste, runny nose and nasal congestion. Sinuses are air‐filled cavities in the bones of the face, which are in continuity with the nasal passages. The first‐line treatment for nasal polyps is usually medical therapy in the form of steroids ‐ as sprays (topically) or by mouth (orally). In patients where this treatment has failed to relieve the symptoms, the polyps can be removed surgically. These surgical procedures are often not curative and patients may need to continue medical therapy or undergo further surgeries. A number of well‐established surgical techniques can be used to remove polyps. What has not been established is whether removing the nasal polyps and clearing out the sinuses offers any advantage in the control of the disease when compared to simply removing the polyps and leaving the sinuses unchanged. We sought evidence in the literature to establish whether there was any difference in patients who underwent nasal polyp removal alone versus those who had nasal polyps removed as well as opening up of the sinuses. 
Study characteristics 
No trials met our inclusion criteria. We did identify six controlled trials (five of which were randomised) in which some but not all of our inclusion criteria were met, but we had to exclude these studies from the review.
