Depot fluspirilene for schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one percent. Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, but compliance with medication is often poor due to the adverse effects profile of the drugs and/or the patient's beliefs about their illness. Non‐compliance with medication is a major cause of relapse with significant personal, social and economic costs. 
Depot antipsychotics were developed in the 1960's specifically to promote treatment compliance and gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long‐term maintenance treatment. Depot antipsychotics are administered intramuscularly and the drug is released into the body slowly over an extended period of time. These antipsychotics need to be injected only once every 2‐4 weeks. 
Fluspirilene is a relatively long‐acting injectable depot antipsychotic drug used for schizophrenia. We updated the original systematic review (David 1999) on Depot fluspirilene for schizophrenia with five additional studies. Twelve randomised trials are included. Study sizes are small and most were of short term duration. This cannot be very informative for a drug that is meant for long‐term maintenance treatment. However, from the studies we were able to include, fluspirilene decanoate does not differ greatly from other depot antipsychotics (fluphenazine decanoate, fluphenazine enathate, perphenazine onanthat, pipotiazine undecylenate) with respect to treatment efficacy, response or tolerability. Outcomes suggest that fluspirilene does not differ significantly from oral antipsychotics or in different weekly regimens, although much cannot be inferred because of the shortage of trials.
