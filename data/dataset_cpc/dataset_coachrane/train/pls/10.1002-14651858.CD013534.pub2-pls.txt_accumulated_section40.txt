Skin care interventions for preventing eczema and food allergy
Does moisturising baby skin prevent eczema or food allergies? 
Key messages 
Skin care treatments in babies, such as using moisturisers on the skin during the first year of life, probably do not stop them from developing eczema, and probably increase the chance of skin infection. 
We are uncertain how skin care treatments might affect the chances of developing a food allergy. We need evidence from well‐conducted studies to determine effects of skin care on food allergies in babies. 
What are allergies? 
An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful. An allergy is a reaction of the body's immune system to a particular food or substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless. Different allergies affect different parts of the body, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
Food allergies and eczema 
Eczema is a common skin allergy that causes dry, itchy, cracked skin. Eczema is common in children, often developing before their first birthday. It is sometimes a long‐lasting condition, but it may improve or clear as a child gets older. 
Allergies to food can cause itching in the mouth, a raised itchy red rash, swelling of the face, stomach symptoms or difficulty breathing. They usually happen within 2 hours after a food is eaten. 
People with food allergies often have other allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to learn how skin care affects the risk of a baby developing eczema or food allergies. Skin care treatments included: 
• putting moisturisers on a baby's skin;
• bathing babies with water containing moisturisers or moisturising oils;
• advising parents to use less soap, or to bathe their child less often; and
• using water softeners. 
We also wanted to know if these skin care treatments cause any unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies of different types of skin care for healthy babies (aged up to one year) with no previous food allergy, eczema, or other skin condition. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
We were interested in studies that reported:
• how many children developed eczema, or food allergy, by age one to three years;
• how severe the eczema was (assessed by a researcher and by parents);
• how long it took for eczema to develop;
• parents' reports of immediate (under two hours) reactions to a food allergen;
• how many children developed sensitivity to a particular food allergen; and
• any unwanted effects.
We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each study to determine how reliable the results might be. We then combined the results of all relevant studies and looked at overall effects.   
What we found 
We found 33 studies involving 25,827 babies. These studies took place in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the USA, most often at children's hospitals. Skin care was compared against no skin care or care as usual (standard care). Treatment and follow‐up times ranged from 24 hours to two years. Many studies (13) tested the use of moisturisers; others mainly tested the use of bathing and cleansing products and how often they were used. 
We combined the results of 11 studies; eight included babies thought to have high risk of developing eczema or a food allergy. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared to no skin care or standard care, moisturisers:
• probably do not change the risk of developing eczema by the age of one to two years (evidence from 7 studies in 3075 babies) nor the time needed for eczema to develop (9 studies; 3349 babies); 
• may slightly increase the number of immediate reactions to a common food allergen at two years, as reported by parents (1 study; 1171 babies); 
• probably cause more skin infections (6 studies; 2728 babies);
• may increase unwanted effects, such as a stinging feeling or an allergic reaction to moisturisers (4 studies; 343 babies); and 
• may increase the chance of babies slipping (4 studies; 2538 babies).
We are uncertain whether skin care treatments affect the chance of developing a food allergy as assessed by a researcher (1 study; 996 babies) or sensitivity to food allergens (2 studies; 1055 babies) at age one to two years.
