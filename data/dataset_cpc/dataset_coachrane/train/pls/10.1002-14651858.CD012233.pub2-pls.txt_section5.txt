Key results In a general population of 1000 people (in which 6.4% have a gallbladder polyp), TAUS will overdiagnose 37 people without a polyp as having a polyp, and in 7 people with a polyp, the polyp will be missed. In a population of 1000 people with a gallbladder polyp, of which 10% have a true polyp, 189 people with a pseudo polyp will be indicated as having a true polyp by TAUS, and 90 people by EUS. These people may be treated, which is not necessary. In 32 people, the true polyp will be misclassified as a pseudo polyp by TAUS and in 15 people by EUS. These people would not be treated, while they may need treatment. In a population of 1000 people with a gallbladder polyp, of which 5% have a (pre)cancerous polyp, 105 people with a benign polyp will be indicated as having a (pre)cancerous polyp by TAUS, and 75 people by EUS. These people may be overtreated for a (precursor of) cancer, which is not there. In 11 people, the (pre)cancerous polyp will be misclassified as a benign polyp by TAUS, and in 7 people by EUS. These participants may not receive proper treatment for their (precursor of) cancer. TAUS will correctly diagnose 956 out of 1000 people regarding the presence or absence of gallbladder polyps. For differentiating between polyp types, fewer people will be correctly diagnosed by TAUS, leading to unnecessary treatment for pseudo polyps and neglect of (pre)cancerous polyps. There was insufficient evidence that EUS is better than TAUS in differentiating between true and pseudo polyps and between (pre)cancerous and benign polyps.
