Zinc supplementation for preventing death and disease, and for growth, in children aged six months to 12 years of age 
Review question 
This review investigated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for preventing illness and mortality, and for promoting growth, in children between six months and 12 years of age. 
Background 
Zinc is an essential micronutrient and zinc deficiency is an important public health problem in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Zinc deficiency impairs growth and contributes to numerous child deaths per year due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. This review aimed to determine if giving children zinc supplements would help prevent child death, disease, and growth deficits. 
Study characteristics 
We searched a wide range of electronic databases for studies that randomly assigned children aged six months to 12 years to either zinc supplementation or a control group that did not receive zinc. Eighty randomised studies with 205,401 eligible participants were included in this review. The evidence is current to December 2012. 
Key results and the quality of the evidence 
Giving children zinc supplements might reduce their risk of death in general, and their risk of death due to diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or malaria. The quality of evidence for overall mortality was high, though evidence for other critical outcomes was only moderate. Children given zinc experience less diarrhoeal disease than children not given zinc; however, zinc does not seem to reduce children's risk of respiratory infection or malaria. Zinc supplementation may have a very small effect on growth, but eating more calories would probably have a larger effect for many malnourished children. Children who take zinc supplements may experience vomiting as a side effect.
