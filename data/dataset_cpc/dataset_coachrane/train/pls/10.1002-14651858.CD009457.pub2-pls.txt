Fluids for hydration in children
Background 
Many children in hospital need fluid through an intravenous line (or 'drip') because they cannot eat or drink enough and they need to remain hydrated. This fluid can cause rare but serious side effects due to the salt level in the body decreasing. When the salt level in the body decreases quickly brain swelling can occur, which can result in death. 
There has been uncertainty regarding how much salt the intravenous fluid should contain.
Review question 
Traditionally, fluids containing lower salt levels than blood (hypotonic) have been administered. This analysis compared these fluids with fluid containing a similar salt level to blood (isotonic). We aimed to determine how many patients had low salt levels in the blood when an isotonic fluid was used compared with a hypotonic fluid. 
Key results 
Studies conducted prior to 17 June 2013 were reviewed. We included 10 studies in the analysis, involving a total of 1106 children. When isotonic fluids were used, the sodium level in the body was less likely to be low. One hundred and sixty‐nine children per 1000 had low sodium levels in the blood when an isotonic fluid was given, compared with 338 children per 1000 when a hypotonic fluid was used. The results for serious adverse events associated with isotonic or hypotonic fluids were uncertain. 
This review mainly looked at patients who either had surgery and/or were in intensive care, with most only needing intravenous fluid for less than a day. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included were generally well conducted and were of a high quality.
