Long‐acting preparation of risperidone for schizophrenia
Review question 
Risperidone is a newer antipsychotic drug that was the first available as a long‐lasting injection (a depot injection). The review examines the clinical effects of depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. 
Background 
People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). People can also become withdrawn, socially isolated, tired and apathetic. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, spasms and tiredness. These side effects often mean that people stop taking their medication (non‐ compliance), which may lead to relapse. 
Study characteristics 
The review was updated in 2015 and includes 12 studies with 5723 people who received risperidone depot or a range of other treatments (placebo, general oral antipsychotics, oral risperidone, oral quetiapine, oral aripiprazole, oral olanzapine, atypical/newer depot antipsychotics, older depot antipsychotics). 
Key results 
It is difficult to know from the results of this review if depot risperidone is any more effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia than placebo or other treatments. For people who are happy to take oral medication, depot risperidone is about equal to oral risperidone. People on oral risperidone may continue to benefit if treated with depot risperidone, without the need to take tablets. However, in high doses, depot risperidone can have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, uncontrollable shaking, spasms and tremors. Depot risperidone may bring this new antipsychotic to people who stop taking their tablets, so helping reduce relapse and with little increased risk of side effects.
