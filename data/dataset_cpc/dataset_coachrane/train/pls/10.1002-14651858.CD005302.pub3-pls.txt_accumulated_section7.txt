Is it better for a baby to be born immediately or to wait for labour to start spontaneously when waters break at or after 37 weeks? 
What is the issue? 
If a pregnant woman's waters break without onset of contractions (prelabour rupture of membranes â€“ PROM) at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more, there are two options: the first is for induction of labour so that the baby is born as soon as possible (planned early birth); or secondly, to wait for labour to start naturally (expectant management). 
Why is this important? 
In a previous version of this review we found that planned early birth may reduce the risk of maternal infection without increasing the risk of caesarean section, compared with waiting. Fewer infants went to the neonatal intensive care unit with planned early birth, though there were no differences seen in rates of neonatal infection. While there are some benefits of early induction of labour, it is important to have a more complete picture of what happens with planned early birth compared with waiting for labour to start naturally. 
What evidence did we find? 
This review included data from 23 randomised controlled trials involving 8615 pregnant women at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more. Only three trials were at overall low risk of bias, and the evidence in the review was very low to moderate quality. For planned early birth, 10 trials used intravenous oxytocin for induction of labour, 12 trials used prostaglandins, and one trial each assessed Caulophyllum and acupuncture.
