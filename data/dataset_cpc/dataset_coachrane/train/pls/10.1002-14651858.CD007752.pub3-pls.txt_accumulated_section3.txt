Interventions to reduce harm to women and their children from untreated low levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy 
The thyroid is a butterfly‐shaped gland at the front of the oesophagus/throat that produces thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone helps the body to make energy, keeps body temperature regulated and assists other organs in their functions. Hypothyroidism (a deficiency of thyroid hormone) is a relatively common illness that can cause fatigue, constipation, muscle cramps and weakness, hair loss, dry skin, intolerance to cold, depression and weight gain. Medication is with levothyroxine. Selenium is a trace element that changes the expression of selenoproteins. These act as antioxidants and appear to decrease thyroid inflammation in autoimmune thyroiditis. Pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism have abnormal thyroid hormone levels but no symptoms. They are at a increased risk of miscarriage, pre‐eclampsia and preterm birth with impaired neuropsychological development in the child. 
We identified four randomised studies involving only 362 women with hypothyroidism. In one trial of 115 women with thyroid autoantibodies but normal thyroid hormone levels, levothyroxine clearly reduced the risk of preterm birth by 72% compared with no treatment. The risk of women developing pre‐eclampsia was not reduced, but there was a trend toward a reduction in miscarriage. In a study of 169 women with autoimmune hypothyroidism, supplementation with selenium did not decrease preterm birth rates or pre‐eclampsia, but appeared to reduce moderate to severe inflammation of the thyroid gland and thyroid dysfunction after the birth. The third and fourth studies looked at different doses of levothyroxine on thyroid hormone levels.
