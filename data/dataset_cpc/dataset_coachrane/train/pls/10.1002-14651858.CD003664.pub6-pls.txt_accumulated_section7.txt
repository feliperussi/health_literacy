Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease in infants
Review question 
Does feeding infants with a formula containing hydrolysed protein result in decreased risk of developing allergic disease such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever and food allergy during infancy and childhood? 
Background 
Allergic disease is responsible for a substantial health burden among infants, children and adults. Early dietary intake may influence the development of allergic disease. When babies are not exclusively breast fed, use of hydrolysed formula instead of ordinary cow's milk formula may reduce allergic disease among babies and children, although additional studies are needed to confirm this. Infant formulas have been designed to lower the chance of infants developing allergic disease. These include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy milk formulas. Hydrolysed formulas break down milk proteins into smaller, potentially less allergy‚Äêproducing proteins. 
Results 
This review of trials found no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease in preference to exclusive breast feeding. This review also found that for infants who are unable to be exclusively breast fed, there is no evidence that prolonged infant feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a cow's milk is associated with any difference in allergic disease, asthma, eczema, rhinitis, food allergy or cow's milk formula at any time point. However, limited data in infants who are exclusively formula fed suggest that feeding with a hydrolysed formula instead of a cow's milk formula may reduce infant allergic disease. Concerns regarding quality of the evidence and consistency of the results indicate that continued study is needed. The evidence in this review comes from literature searches updated until November 2017.
