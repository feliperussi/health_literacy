What is medical abortion? 
Medical abortion uses one or more medicines alone or in combination to end a pregnancy. The most common medicines are the hormones prostaglandin and mifepristone. Other medicines include methotrexate (a kind of chemotherapy), and letrozole, which slows the production of the hormone oestrogen. These medicines work by softening the cervix (neck of the womb) and causing the uterus (womb) to contract. They may be swallowed (taken orally), put under the tongue or in the cheek, or put in the vagina. They can be given by a nurse or a doctor in hospital, or taken by women at home. 
Medical abortion methods may cause unwanted effects such as heavy bleeding, pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, Failed abortion is an infrequent but important complication of medical abortion. Medical methods for early abortion are already widely available in some countries, and new medicines are being developed.
