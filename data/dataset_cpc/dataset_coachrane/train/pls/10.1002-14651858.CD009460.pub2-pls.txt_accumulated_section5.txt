Uric acid lowering therapies for preventing or delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease 
What is the issue? 
There is some evidence to suggest that patients with higher uric acid levels in the blood may be more at risk for either developing kidney damage or for kidney damage that they already have getting worse. This study is designed to answer the question "if we reduce uric acid levels in the blood with specific treatments, will that protect the patient from worsening kidney damage or from developing kidney damage in the first place?" 
Long‚Äêterm damage to the kidney (chronic kidney disease) is an increasing problem across the world. With worse damage to the kidney, there are increasing risks of heart disease and death, as well as the increased need for dialysis treatment when kidneys finally fail. There is a great deal of research being performed aimed at reducing both the occurrence of kidney damage and the gradual worsening of damage that is present. This is aimed at reducing death, heart disease, and the need for dialysis treatment. 
Uric acid, or urate, is an end product of the breakdown of DNA and is present in everyone. Increasing levels of urate are thought to be potentially damaging to the heart and blood vessels and possibly also the kidney. In kidney patients, it is well known that as kidney damage worsens, the level of urate in the blood tends to rise. There is increasing suspicion that this rise in urate levels in kidney patients is not just the result of kidney damage but may be actually making the situation worse.
