Back School for the treatment of chronic low back pain
Background 
Many people with low back pain (LBP) seeking treatments that minimise the severity of their symptoms become frequent users of healthcare services. Back School consists of a therapeutic programme given to groups of people that includes both education and exercise. Since its introduction in 1969, the Swedish Back School has frequently been used in the treatment of LBP. However, the content of Back School has changed over time and appears to vary widely today. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of Back School on pain and disability in adults with LBP with no specific cause lasting more than 12 weeks compared to no treatment, medical care, physiotherapist‐applied treatment, or exercise. We included adverse events as a secondary outcome. In trials that only recruited workers, we also examined the effect on work status. 
Study characteristics 
In this update we searched for trials, both published and unpublished, to 15 November 2016. We included 30 trials with 4105 participants comparing Back School to no treatment, medical care, passive physiotherapy (physiotherapist‐applied treatment), or exercise therapy. All studies included a similar population of people with chronic non‐specific LBP. 
Key results 
Regardless of the comparison used (as well as the outcomes investigated), the results of the meta‐analysis showed no difference or a trivial effect in favour of Back School. Due to a lack of information on adverse effects and work status, we were unable to statistically pool the data. 
Quality of evidence 
Due to the low‐ to very low‐quality evidence for all treatment comparisons, outcomes, and follow‐up periods investigated, it is uncertain if Back School is effective for chronic low back pain.
