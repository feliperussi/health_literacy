Is attachment of the excretory duct of the pancreas to the second part of the small intestine better than other reconstruction methods to reduce leakage of juice from the pancreas to the abdominal tissues? 
Key messages 
‐ We do not know whether duct‐to‐mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy (attachment of the excretory duct of the pancreas to the second part of the small intestine) reduces postoperative pancreatic fistula (leakage of juice from the pancreas to the abdominal tissues) compared to invagination pancreaticojejunostomy (insertion of the pancreas within the second part of the small intestine). 
‐ We do not know whether modified duct‐to‐mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy is superior, equivalent or inferior to traditional duct‐to‐mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy. 
‐ Future studies should use adequate methods to improve our confidence in the evidence.
What is a postoperative pancreatic fistula? 
The pancreas is a digestive gland located at the back of the upper abdomen; it is also vital to the normal control of blood sugar. The standard surgical treatment for cancer or inflammation of the pancreas is partial removal of the head of the pancreas, together with the nearby gut, through a procedure known as pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy involves reconnecting the pancreas and the second part of the small intestine (a procedure known as pancreaticojejunostomy) to allow pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes to enter the digestive system. A postoperative pancreatic fistula occurs when the reconnection does not heal properly, creating a leakage of pancreatic juice from the pancreas to the abdominal tissues. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is a complication that delays recovery from surgery and often requires further treatment to ensure complete healing.
