A machine pushes air into the lungs helping people with cystic fibrosis breathe, clear mucus, reduce respiratory failure, improve exercise tolerance 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence that mechanically pushing air into the lungs through a mask helps clear mucus, improves breathing overnight, reduces respiratory failure and improves exercise tolerance. 
Background 
As cystic fibrosis worsens, breathing becomes difficult, indicating the start of respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in the blood). As respiratory failure progresses, people may become breathless and have problems clearing mucus. Respiratory failure eventually results in death. 
Non‐invasive ventilation administers room air or oxygen through a mask and has been used to help people with more severe cystic fibrosis to clear their airways of mucus and improve breathing during sleep; it may also help with exercise. It is not certain exactly how this works, but it might reduce fatigue in the respiratory muscles, stop the airways from closing during prolonged exhalation and reduce the effort needed to maintain ventilation and oxygen levels. Treatment has been recommended when breathing muscles are weak, when a person has difficulty clearing mucus using other airway clearance techniques or when there are high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood during sleep or during exercise.

Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 trials (191 people with cystic fibrosis) ‐ seven single‐treatment sessions and a two‐week trial, a six‐week trial and a three‐month trial. Six single‐treatment trials, the two‐week trial and the three‐month trial compared non‐invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two single‐treatment trials and the six‐week trial looked at non‐invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One single‐treatment trial compared non‐invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test.
