This review identified two small randomized controlled trials that included a total of 46 participants. One study compared 12 weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (4.5 mg/day) to a placebo (i.e. a fake drug such as a sugar pill) in 34 adult patients with active Crohnâ€™s disease. The other study compared eight weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum 4.5 mg/day) to a placebo in 12 children with active Crohn's disease. The results from both studies were imprecise with regard to the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission. The results of the study in adult patients suggest that low dose naltrexone may provide a benefit in terms of clinical response (i.e. an improvement in disease symptoms) and endoscopic response (i.e. a reduction in inflammation of the gut as shown by examining the gut with a scope). We could not tell whether low dose naltrexone led to specific side effects including sleep disturbance, unusual dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue due to the low number of people who experienced these problems in the studies. The results of this review need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. Thus no firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness and side effect profile of low dose naltrexone treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of low dose naltrexone therapy in active Crohn's disease in both adults and children.
