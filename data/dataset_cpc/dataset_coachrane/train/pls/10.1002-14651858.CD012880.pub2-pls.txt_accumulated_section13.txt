Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and other 12‐step programs for alcohol use disorder
Review question 
This review summarized research comparing the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and similarTwelve‐Step Facilitation (TSF) programs (AA/TSF) to other treatments to see if they help people with drinking problems to stay sober, or reduce alcohol consumption and drinking‐related consequences. We also examined whether AA/TSF reduces healthcare costs relative to other treatments. 
Background 
Alcohol use disorder (i.e. alcoholism) is a concerning individual and public health problem worldwide. Treatment is expensive. AA is a widespread and free mutual‐help fellowship that helps people to recover from alcoholism and to improve their quality of life.

Study characteristics 
We identified 27 relevant studies that had included 10,565 participants. The studies varied in design; and whether treatments were delivered according to standardized procedures (i.e. manualized); and whether AA/TSF was compared to a treatment that had a different theoretical basis (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)), or to a different type of TSF (i.e. one that varied in style or intensity from the AA TSF). 
Study funding sources 
The Included studies were funded through one or more grants from the United States National Institutes of Health (18 studies), the USA Department of Veterans Affairs (8 studies), and other organizations (e.g. private foundations or academic institutions; 8 studies). Two studies did not report their source of funding. 
Key results 
Manualized AA/TSF interventions usually produced higher rates of continuous abstinence than the other established treatments investigated. Non‐manualized AA/TSF performed as well as other established treatments.
