Adenosine versus intravenous calcium channel antagonists for tachycardia in adults
Background 
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common abnormal rhythm of the heart that results in a very rapid heartbeat. This rhythm problem usually occurs in otherwise healthy people, and common symptoms include palpitations, light‐headedness, and chest pain. Occasionally, SVT may also cause confusion or loss of consciousness. SVT can sometimes be treated with simple physical manoeuvres such as forced breath holding. When simple manoeuvres fail, SVT can be treated in the emergency department with a variety of drugs. The two most commonly used drug types are adenosine and calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) (verapamil is the most frequently used drug in this class). 
Study characteristics 
This review compares effectiveness and side effects of adenosine and CCAs in terminating SVT episodes. We included in the review seven trials involving 622 patients. Evidence is current to July 2017. 
Key results 
Combined analysis of these trials showed no differences between adenosine and CCAs in successfully treating SVT. This finding is based on moderate‐quality evidence. A temporary drop in blood pressure that did not require treatment was reported in only one of 152 study participants treated with CCAs, and low‐quality evidence suggests that no patients treated with adenosine experienced low blood pressure. We have no data on length of stay in hospital nor on patient satisfaction. 
Conclusions 
Moderate‐quality evidence shows no differences in effects of adenosine and calcium channel antagonists for treatment of SVT on reverting to sinus rhythm, and low‐quality evidence suggests no differences in cases of hypotension. None of these trials examined patient preferences, which is an important factor in deciding which drug is the 'best' treatment.
