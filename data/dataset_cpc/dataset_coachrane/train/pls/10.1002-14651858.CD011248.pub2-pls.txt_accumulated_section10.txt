Does breastfeeding reduce vaccination pain in babies aged 1 to 12 months?
Bottom line 
We found that breastfeeding before and during vaccination injections helped to reduce pain in most babies up to the age of one year. 
Background 
Needles are used for babies' early childhood vaccinations and medical care during childhood illnesses. These are essential, but painful. They cause distress for the babies and often their parents/caregivers, and can result in future anxiety and fear about needles. Breastfeeding during blood tests in newborn babies reduces pain. Breastfeeding when possible and feasible may also help to comfort babies and reduce their pain beyond the newborn period and throughout infancy. 
Study characteristics 
In February 2016 we searched the medical literature for studies examining the effectiveness of breastfeeding babies 1 to 12 months old during the use of needles. We compared effectiveness of breastfeeding in reducing pain (as scored by crying time and pain scores), to holding, babies lying flat, or the giving of water or sweet solutions. We found 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies examined if breastfeeding reduced pain during vaccinations. 
Key results 
Breastfeeding reduced crying in young babies having vaccinations. On average, breastfed babies cried for 38 seconds less than babies who were not breastfed (6 studies; 547 infants; moderate‐quality evidence), and pain scores were significantly lower (5 studies; 310 infants; moderate‐quality evidence). 
No studies reported on any harm (very low‐quality evidence). We could draw no conclusions on risk of harm while breastfeeding healthy babies during vaccination.
