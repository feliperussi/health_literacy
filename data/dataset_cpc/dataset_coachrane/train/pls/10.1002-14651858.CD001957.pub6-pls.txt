Homeopathic Oscillococcinum® for preventing and treating influenza and influenza‐like illness 
Review question To determine whether homeopathic Oscillococcinum® is more effective than placebo in the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and influenza‐like illness in adults or children. 
Background Influenza ('the flu') is a highly infectious viral respiratory disease. Other than treatments for complications (such as pneumonia), the conventional medical strategies for the prevention or treatment of flu are not entirely effective or satisfactory. Oscillococcinum® is a highly diluted homeopathic preparation manufactured from wild duck heart and liver, which may be reservoirs of flu viruses. Some people take Oscillococcinum® regularly over the winter months either to prevent flu or as a treatment for flu symptoms. 
Study characteristics We included six studies, which comprised two prevention trials (a total of 327 young to middle‐aged adults in Russia) and four treatment trials (a total of 1196 teenagers and adults in France and Germany). 
Key results The findings from the two prevention trials did not show that Oscillococcinum® can prevent the onset of flu. Although the results from the four other clinical trials suggested that Oscillococcinum® relieved flu symptoms at 48 hours, this might be due to bias in the trial methods. One patient reported headache after taking Oscillococcinum®. The evidence is current to September 2014. 
Quality of the evidence The overall standard of research reporting was poor, and thus many aspects of the trials' methods and results were at unclear risk of bias. We therefore judged the evidence overall as low quality, preventing clear conclusions from being made about Oscillococcinum® in the prevention or treatment of flu and flu‐like illness.
