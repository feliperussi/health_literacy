Interventions for intra‐operative pain relief during postpartum mini‐laparotomy tubal ligation 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare interventions for intraoperative pain relief with other interventions or no intervention, during mini‐laparotomy (small surgical incision through the abdominal wall) tubal ligation (uterine tubes tied) after delivery. 
Background 
Tubal ligation is a permanent form of birth control during which a woman's uterine tubes are surgically cut or blocked off, to prevent pregnancy. This surgery can be done through a mini‐laparotomy. There are various methods used for pain relief during a mini‐laparotomy tubal ligation. Some methods of pain relief include an injection of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (a class of medication that can reduce pain and fever), opioids (a class of medications related in structure to opium), or pouring lidocaine (a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area) into the abdominal cavity. 
Study characteristics 
We included three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 230 women. These studies compared lidocaine poured into the abdominal cavity with a placebo, or other treatments, such as an injection of morphine (also known as an opioid) into the muscle, or combination of lidocaine and morphine. All studies took place in Thailand. The evidence described here are from studies published before 31 July, 2017. 
Key results 
Pouring lidocaine into the abdominal cavity during a mini‐laparotomy tubal ligation before fallopian tubes were tied after delivery may offer better pain control than a placebo or morphine injection, although the evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Women who received a combination of morphine injection and lidocaine poured into the abdominal cavity showed no clear difference in pain with those who received lidocaine alone. An injection of morphine into the muscle alone did not reduce pain more than a placebo.
