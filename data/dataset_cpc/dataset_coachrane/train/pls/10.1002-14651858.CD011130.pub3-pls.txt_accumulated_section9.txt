Folate supplementation in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We wanted to assess how effective and safe folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) is in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). 
Background 
SCD is a group of disorders affecting haemoglobin (the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body), leading to distorted sickle or crescent‐shaped red blood cells. It is characterized by anaemia (the blood cannot carry enough oxygen around the body), repeated infections and episodes of pain. While SCD was originally found in the tropics and subtropics, due to migration, it is now common worldwide. There are three widely‐used preventative measures for managing SCD, these include penicillin, immunisation against pneumococcal infection and folate supplementation. Folate is a water‐soluble B vitamin needed for erythropoiesis (the process which produces red blood cells). Given there is increased erythropoiesis in people with SCD, it is thought they may require increased folate intake, by supplements or through diet. However, a lack of evidence‐based research means it is still not clear whether the benefits of supplementation outweigh the risk of possible adverse effects.

Study characteristics 
We included one trial with 117 children with SCD aged between six months and four years. This was a one‐year doubIe‐blind (both participants and doctors did not know which treatment group the participants were allocated to) controlled triaI comparing children taking folic acid supplements to those taking a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment).
