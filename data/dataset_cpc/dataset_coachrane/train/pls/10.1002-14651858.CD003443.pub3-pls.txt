Perphenazine for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Perphenazine is an old antipsychotic drug (typical or first‚Äêgeneration) formulated in the 1950s with an effectiveness similar to another antipsychotic drug called haloperidol. Perphenazine is particularly popular in Northern European countries and Japan. 
The aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine for schizophrenia. A search for relevant randomised studies was run in September 2013. The review authors included 31 studies that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either perphenazine or placebo or another antipsychotic drug. A total of 4662 people participated in these studies. The quality of evidence presented by the trials was rated by the review authors to be very low quality. It was found that perphenazine was no better or worse than other older antipsychotic drugs in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, and like other older antipsychotic drugs, the side effects of perphenazine included tremors, uncontrollable shaking, the inability to sit still and feeling restless. 
Although perphenazine has been used for more than 50 years, poor studies with bad reporting of information mean that it is difficult to draw more clear findings and conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine. However, perphenazine is inexpensive and a popular antipsychotic drug in many countries, so further research and trials on its effectiveness and safety are much needed.
