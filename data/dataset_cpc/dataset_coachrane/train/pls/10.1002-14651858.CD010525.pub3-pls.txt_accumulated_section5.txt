Venous blood clot prevention in people undergoing lower limb amputation
Background 
Amputation of the leg is most often performed to remove dead tissue (gangrene), painful ulcers, tumours, or tissue with an inadequate blood supply. One of the most common causes of an inadequate blood supply is a narrowing of the arteries of the legs, which accounts for approximately 70% of amputations. In people with this condition, blood clots are more likely to cause problems such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). This comprises two conditions: a blood clot in the legs (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) or a blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism (PE)). The risk of these events occurring is higher in people undergoing amputations. There are two forms of preventive measures for VTE: drugs or compression devices. Drugs are effective in preventing VTE, but also have adverse side effects. Compression stockings or devices do not cause side effects, but are not suitable for everyone. Current guidelines recommend that any person undergoing an amputation of the lower limb should be offered drugs to prevent a blood clot. However, it is not clear which method is best for people having a lower limb amputation. This review aimed to establish the best method. 
Study characteristics and main results 
This review was first published in 2013, and we searched for any studies that have taken place since then (up to 5 November 2019). We did not find any eligible new studies for this update. The review includes the original two studies with a combined total of 288 participants.
