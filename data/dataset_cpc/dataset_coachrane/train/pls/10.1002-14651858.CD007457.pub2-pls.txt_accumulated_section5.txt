Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care
Many costly and disabling conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or diabetes are linked by common preventable risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy nutrition, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use. However, prevention still plays a secondary role in many health systems as all too often, healthcare workers fail to seize interactions with patient as opportunities to inform them about health promotion and disease prevention strategies. This review examined whether mobile phone applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) can support and enhance primary preventive health interventions. 
There was moderate quality evidence from one study which showed that pregnant women who received supportive, informative text messages experienced higher satisfaction and confidence, and lower anxiety levels in the antenatal period than women who did not receive these. There was low quality evidence that there was no difference in pregnancy outcomes. 
We found one trial that provided high quality evidence that regular support messages sent by text message can help people to quit smoking, at least in the short‐term. One study assessing whether mobile phone messaging promoted use of preventive medication reported moderate quality evidence of higher self‐reported adherence by people receiving the messages. A fourth study on healthy behaviours in children found very low quality evidence showing that the interventions had no effect. 
There was very low quality evidence from one study that people's evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in harms of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates. There were no studies reporting outcomes related to health service utilisation or costs.
