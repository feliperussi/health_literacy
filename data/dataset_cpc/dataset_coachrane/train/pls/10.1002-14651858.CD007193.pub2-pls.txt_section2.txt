Despite the prevalence and negative impacts of mental disorders, many people are not diagnosed or do not receive adequate treatment. Consultation liaison is one way of providing mental health care to people in the primary care setting. In consultation liaison, a mental health specialist works with the primary care provider to deliver appropriate care for people with mental health needs. In this review of studies published up till March 2014, the effectiveness of consultation liaison was compared to standard primary care and other types of mental health care. We included 12 trials with 2605 consumers and more than 905 primary care providers. Consultation liaison was compared to standard care in 11 trials, and compared to collaborative care in one trial. Collaborative care is mental health care co‚Äêordinated by a primary care case manager. There was some evidence that consultation liaison improved mental health, satisfaction with care and adherence to treatment in people with some mental disorders, particularly those with depression, and improved mental health care by primary care providers. There was also some evidence suggesting consultation liaison may not be as effective as collaborative care. However, as the overall quality of trials was low, the effectiveness of these ways of delivering care may have been overestimated. No conclusions can be made regarding the use of consultation liaison with people who have other mental disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was also no data which could inform practice with specific groups of people such as children and adolescents, and the elderly. More high quality trials of consultation liaison are needed.
