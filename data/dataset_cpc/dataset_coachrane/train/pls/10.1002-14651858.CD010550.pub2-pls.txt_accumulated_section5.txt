Natural cycle in vitro fertilisation for subfertile couples
Review question: To determine whether in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in a natural cycle is a good alternative to standard IVF for subfertile couples. 
Background: Assisted reproduction techniques such as IVF can help subfertile women to achieve a pregnancy. In IVF, an egg is fertilised in a laboratory and placed back in the woman's uterus. Different IVF protocols have been developed since the first IVF in 1978 including natural cycle IVF (without hyperstimulation of the ovaries), modified natural cycle IVF (with low dose ovarian hyperstimulation) and IVF with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of natural cycle IVF and modified natural cycle IVF compared with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation IVF in subfertile couples. 
Study characteristics: Six trials were included, with a total of 788 women undergoing an IVF treatment. The evidence is current to 31st July 2013. The largest trial in the review (with 396 women) has not yet reported full results. 
Key points: The evidence suggested that for a woman with a 53% chance of live birth using standard IVF, the chance using natural cycle IVF ranges from 34% to 53%. No significant difference was found in rates of clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, gestational abnormalities or cancellations of treatment. However findings were imprecise for all outcomes and further evidence from larger studies is awaited. There was evidence from single studies that a lower number of oocytes was retrieved in the natural cycle group. Findings on cost‚Äêeffectiveness were inconsistent.
