Gabapentin as an add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures (fits) are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (well‐designed clinical trials in which people are allocated at random to test a specific drug, treatment or other intervention) are often used to examine how effective and safe antiepileptic medicines are in people who experience such seizures. This review included 12 studies and data from 2607 people with focal seizures (seizures that occur in just one part of the brain). 
Study characteristics 
Data from six studies were combined in the analysis. All participants (including adults and children) were previously taking at least one antiepileptic medicine and all were continuing to have seizures. Either gabapentin (an antiepileptic medicine) or a placebo (a tablet that contains no medicine) was added to the medicine regimen. 
Key results 
The results showed that gabapentin effectively reduced seizures when used as an additional treatment. Compared to a placebo, gabapentin was almost twice as likely to reduce seizures by 50% or more. The most common side effects associated with gabapentin were ataxia (poor co‐ordination and unsteady gait), dizziness, fatigue and drowsiness. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate as information was not reported for all participants in some of the trials and some of the results were imprecise. Research is needed into the effects of the long‐term use of gabapentin, and to compare gabapentin with other add‐on medicines. 
The evidence is current to 11 August 2020.
