Whole brain radiotherapy for the treatment of multiple brain metastases
The issueA large proportion of people with cancer will receive a diagnosis of the spread of cancer (metastases) to the brain. Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat brain metastases. 
The aim of the reviewWe conducted this review to determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) given alone or in combination with other treatments to adults with multiple brain metastases. 
What are the main findings?This review includes 54 published trials involving 11,898 participants. 
Data show no apparent additional benefit of altered WBRT dose schedules compared with standard dose schedules. 
Use of other treatments such as chemotherapy, radiosensitisers, and molecular targeted agents in conjunction with WBRT has not yet been shown to be of benefit. 
Radiosurgery boost with WBRT does not improve survival among selected people with multiple brain metastases. WBRT when added to radiosurgery improves local and distant brain control. However, neurocognitive outcomes are better for selected people treated with radiosurgery alone as compared with WBRT and radiosurgery. 
For selected individuals with metastatic non‐small‐cell lung cancer to brain, survival may not be better with WBRT and optimal supportive care than with optimal supportive care alone. 
Quality of the evidenceStudies have provided evidence of moderate to high certainty. 
What are the conclusions?Altered higher biological WBRT dose‐fractionation schemes, as reported in randomised trials, did not confer benefit for overall survival, neurological function, or symptom control compared with standard treatment (3000 cGy in 10 daily fractions, or 2000 cGy in 4 or 5 daily fractions). However, overall survival and neurological function were worse for lower biological WBRT dose‐fractionation schemes than for standard dose schedules.
