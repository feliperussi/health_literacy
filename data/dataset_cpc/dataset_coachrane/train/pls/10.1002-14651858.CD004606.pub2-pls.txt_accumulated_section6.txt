Are school‐based programmes aimed at children who are considered at risk of aggressive behaviour, effective in reducing violence? 
Violence is recognised as a major global public health problem, thus there has been much attention placed on interventions aimed at preventing aggressive and violent behaviour. As aggressive behaviour in childhood is considered to be a risk factor for violence and criminal behaviour in adulthood, violence prevention strategies targeted at children and adolescents, such as school‐based programmes, are considered to be promising interventions. 
Some school‐based prevention programmes target all children attending a school or class, whilst others confine the intervention to those children who have already been identified as exhibiting, or threatening, behaviour considered to be aggressive, such an approach is known as 'secondary prevention'. A wide variety of school‐based violence prevention programmes have been implemented over the last 20 years, yet we are still without a full understanding of their effectiveness. 
The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of school‐based secondary prevention programmes to prevent violence (that is those interventions targeted at children identified as aggressive or at risk of being aggressive) . 
The authors examined all trials investigating the effectiveness of secondary violence prevention programmes targeted at children in mandatory education compared to no intervention or a placebo intervention. 
The authors found 56 studies; the overall findings show that school‐based secondary prevention programmes aimed at reducing aggressive behaviour do appear to produce improvements in behaviour. The improvements can be achieved in both primary and secondary school age groups and in both mixed sex groups and boy‐only groups.
