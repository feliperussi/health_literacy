What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?
Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.
