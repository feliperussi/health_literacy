EEG for children with complex febrile seizures
Background Febrile seizures (fits) can be classified as simple or complex. Complex febrile seizures are associated with a high temperature (fever), last longer than 15 minutes, occur more than once within 24 hours, and are confined to one side of the child's body. It is common in some countries for doctors to recommend an electroencephalograph (EEG), which records electrical activity in the brain, on children with complex febrile seizures. The EEG may help identify why the seizures occur and predict the risk of future seizures. 
Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups; these are regarded as a gold standard for trial design) that compared EEG with no EEG or a delayed EEG (occurring at second seizure) in children under five years of age with a first complex febrile seizure. We planned to look at the number of seizures that occurred at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after EEG. 
Key results and quality of the evidence We attempted to search all possible sources but were unable to find any randomised controlled trials to address the issue up to 12 March 2019. We concluded that there is no high‐quality evidence to support or refute the use of an EEG and its timing after complex febrile seizures in children. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are therefore required. We intend to update this review regularly with the hope that new randomised studies will be reported in the future.
