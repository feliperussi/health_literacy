Combined treatment with GnRH analogues and add‐back therapy for women with uterine fibroids 
Review question 
Uterine fibroids may be shrunk with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues but commonly cause hot flushes. Combining GnRHa with other drugs may decrease hot flushes (a strategy known as add‐back therapy) but cause other problems such as low bone mineral density. The efficacy and safety of this approach is controversial. 
Background 
Uterine fibroids are benign tumours that arise from the wall of the uterus. Although they are mostly asymptomatic, women with associated symptoms may require treatment. Medical options for treating the condition are limited and, among them, a class of drugs named GnRH analogues is considered effective for decreasing the size of the tumour and for controlling symptoms such as uterine bleeding and pelvic pressure. This class of drugs, however, is limited by its adverse effects, mainly a rise in the incidence of hot flashes and reduced bone mass. Therefore, prolonged treatment is usually not recommended. 
Study characteristics 
In June 2014, Cochrane authors performed computer searches of the medical literature to locate all relevant studies about this subject, in any language. We found 14 eligible randomized controlled trials. We analysed their data, assessed them for the quality of their methods and precision of their results, and communicated with their authors to obtain additional information and to clarify any doubts about the information. 
Key results 
Quality of life  
Available evidence from 110 women suggested that tibolone may have a very small to large benefit with respect to quality of life when compared with the use of GnRH analogues alone. There was no evidence that raloxifene had an effect on quality of life (data from 74 women). The effect of other add‐back agents on quality of life had not been studied.
