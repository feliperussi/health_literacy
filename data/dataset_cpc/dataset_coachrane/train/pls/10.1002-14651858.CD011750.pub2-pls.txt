Systemic treatment for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children
Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) is a condition that involves inflammation of the eyelids and the front of the eye. It occurs in children and adults. Children with BKC have watering, itching, red eyes that are painful in bright light. They may develop loss of vision due to scarring of the cornea, which can be described as the front windscreen of the eye. Various treatments are given for BKC, including antibiotics, anti‐inflammatory agents and dietary supplements. Sometimes these treatments are given as eye drops and ointment while in severe cases they may be given systemically (usually orally). It can also be easier to administer medication to children orally than giving eye drops or ointment. 
This Cochrane review aimed to assess the effects of systemic treatments for BKC in children aged between zero to 16 years. We searched the published literature and registers of clinical trials for studies. We did not find any high quality research studies in this subject area. No report or trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. The studies we found did not compare the treatment against another treatment or placebo in a randomised way, so we cannot be certain that the effects of treatment seen are not due to other factors. Doctors also used many different ways to measure the effects of treatments. The searches are current to April 2016. 
We recommend further research into the effects of systemic treatment for BKC. We also recommend developing new ways of measuring the effects of treatments taking into account clinical measurements and children’s and families’ opinions on their condition.
