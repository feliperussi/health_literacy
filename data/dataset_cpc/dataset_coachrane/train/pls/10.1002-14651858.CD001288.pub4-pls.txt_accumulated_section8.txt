Do systemic corticosteroids improve treatment outcomes in flare‐ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? 
Why is this question important? 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also referred to as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, is a long‐term lung condition commonly associated with smoking. People with COPD usually have persistent symptoms of breathlessness and may experience flare‐ups (exacerbations) on occasion, often precipitated by infection, in which symptoms become markedly worse and further medical intervention is required beyond regular treatment by inhalers. 
Systemic (i.e. not inhaled corticosteroids) such as prednisolone, prednisone and cortisone, are anti‐inflammatory drugs commonly used in the treatment of exacerbations. We wanted to assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids and whether different routes of administration have impacts on response to treatment of COPD exacerbations. 
How did we answer the question? 
We looked for all studies that compared corticosteroid, given either by injections (parenterally) or tablets (orally), with matching dummy injections or tablets and all studies that compared corticosteroid given by injections with corticosteroid given by tablets. 
What did we find? 
We found 16 studies including over 1700 people with COPD who experienced a flare‐up that required additional medical treatment that compared corticosteroid given by injections or tablets with dummy treatment. Four studies with nearly 300 people compared corticosteroid injections with corticosteroid tablets. More men than women took part in the studies and they were usually in their late 60s, with moderately severe symptoms of COPD. Most studies took place in hospitals, two in intensive care units with people who needed breathing support, and three studies involved people who were treated at home. The last search for studies to include in the review was done in May 2014.
