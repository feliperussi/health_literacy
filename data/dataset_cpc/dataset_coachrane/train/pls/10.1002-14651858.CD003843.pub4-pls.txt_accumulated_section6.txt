Bispectral index (BIS) for improving intraoperative awareness and early postoperative recovery in adults 
Background 
During surgery under general anaesthesia, the anaesthetist will adjust the amount of anaesthetic drugs to ensure that the patient remains unconscious. This adjustment is made according to clinical signs, such as the patient's heart rate or blood pressure, or end‐tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) for anaesthesia that is given as a gas, which is a measure of the amount of remaining gas after the patient breathes out. However, using these methods alone may increase the chance that the patient is given too little or too much anaesthetic. Intraoperative awareness, a distressing event in which a patient may become conscious enough to recall events during surgery, is very rare and may be caused by too little anaesthetic. Too much anaesthetic may lead to a longer time needed to reach full recovery. Bispectral index (BIS) is a measurement scale based on the electrical activity in the brain, and by using a monitor of brain activity during anaesthesia, the anaesthetist may use this scale to inform the amount of anaesthesia to give to the patient. 
This is an update of a review which was previously published in 2014.
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 26 March 2019. We found 52 studies with 41,331 participants. Six studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have sufficient information to assess them), and two studies are ongoing. All studies included people having surgery under general anaesthesia. Three studies included only people who were at high risk of intraoperative awareness, and two studies included only people who were not selected according to high risk of intraoperative awareness. Forty‐eight studies compared BIS‐guided anaesthesia with anaesthesia guided by clinical signs, and six studies compared BIS‐guided anaesthesia with ETAG‐guided anaesthesia.
