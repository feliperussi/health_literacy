Is dexmedetomidine a good option for patients undergoing awake fibreoptic intubation?
This is a review of the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effect of dexmedetomidine in the management of awake fibreoptic intubation. The review was conducted by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration. Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) is indicated for the management of patients with a difficult or unstable (critical) airway, such as those with airway deformity or tumour, airway injury or spinal cord instability. It is necessary in such a situation to maintain patient co‐operation and reduce patient anxiety without causing severe adverse effects during the AFOI. Many agents, including fentanyl, remifentanil, midazolam and propofol, have been reported to assist with AFOI. However, these agents can cause respiratory arrest, loss of airway control or reduced cardiovascular (heart) function, especially when used in high doses, thus increasing the risk of low oxygen levels (hypoxaemia), aspiration, low blood pressure (hypotension) or slow heart rate (bradycardia). 
Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha‐2‐adrenoceptor agonist that can cause sedation, anxiolysis, analgesic sparing, reduced salivary secretion and minimal respiratory depression; this might be beneficial for patients with a difficult or unstable airway undergoing AFOI. 
We searched the medical literature until May 2012 and identified four randomized controlled trials involving 211 patients that were appropriate for inclusion in the review. These studies compared dexmedetomidine versus midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo for patients undergoing AFOI. We reran our search in November 2013, and four studies are awaiting assessment. We will deal with them when we update the review.
