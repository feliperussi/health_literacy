Botulinum toxin injections for preventing migraine in adults
Bottom line 
People with chronic (persisting) migraine treated with botulinum toxin injections had two fewer migraine days per month than people treated with placebo (fake treatment). It is unclear if this improvement was large enough to make a meaningful difference to their lives. More work is needed to show whether botulinum toxin is better than oral treatments (treatments that are swallowed), that prevent migraine. The evidence for botulinum toxin for people with episodic (occasional) migraine was uncertain. Treatment with botulinum toxin did not cause many side effects. 
Background 
Migraine occurs in three in 20 adults and three in every four sufferers are female. People who have 15 or more days of headache in a month, with eight or more of those days being migraine, have chronic migraine. People with fewer than 15 days of headache in a month have episodic migraine. We included trials that compared botulinum toxin treatment with placebo injections of salt water, different doses of botulinum toxin, or other oral treatments to prevent migraine. We collected information for the following outcomes: number of migraine days in a month (our preferred measure); migraine severity; use of medications for migraine symptoms; disease‐rating scales; quality‐of‐life scales; side effects; and cost effectiveness of treatment. 
Trial characteristics 
We found 28 clinical trials involving 4190 participants. Their average age was 42 years and eight in 10 were female. It is likely that we found all relevant trials published before December 2017. Trials were short, the longest lasting nine months. Around half the participants had chronic migraine symptoms and half episodic. Trial doses ranged from 6 to 300 units. The dose recommended for chronic migraine in the UK and USA is 155‐195 units. Sixteen trials, involving 8 in 10 participants, were funded by botulinum toxin manufacturers.
