Ways to help turn a breech baby to head first presentation at the end of pregnancy
Babies born in the breech position (bottom first) are at increased risk of complications at birth because of a delay in birth of the head. Turning a breech baby to head first in late pregnancy may reduce these complications. A procedure called 'external cephalic version (ECV)' describes when practitioners use their hands on the woman's abdomen to gently try to turn the baby from the breech position to head first. A number of treatments may help the success of ECV. These include using tocolytic drugs (drugs like beta stimulants and calcium channel blockers that relax the womb), stimulating the baby with sound through the mother’s abdomen (acoustic stimulation), increasing the fluid surrounding the baby (transabdominal amnioinfusion), injecting pain‐relieving drugs into the mother’s lower back to produce regional analgesia (epidural or spinal analgesia), giving the mother opioid drugs to help her relax, using hypnosis and applying gel or talcum powder to the mother's abdomen.   
This review of trials found 28 randomised controlled studies involving 2786 women. Most studies looked at the effects of tocolytic beta stimulant drugs. Results showed that babies are more likely to turn head first during ECV and to remain head first for the start of labour, if women receive beta stimulants. These drugs also reduced the number of caesarean sections, but insufficient data on possible adverse effects were collected. Little information on other types of tocolytic drugs was available, although nitric oxide donors were associated with an increase in headaches. In addition, too little evidence was available to show whether the other ways of trying to help ECV are effective. Further research is needed if we are to increase the success of ECV.
