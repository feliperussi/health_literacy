Comparing treatment of non‐severe pneumonia, in children aged 2 to 59 months, with and without antibiotics 
Review questionWe tried to identify whether there was a difference in the outcomes for children aged 2 to 59 months with non‐severe pneumonia and wheeze, treated with or without antibiotics. 
BackgroundPneumonia is an infection of the lungs. In children, it is one of the leading causes of deaths globally. Pneumonia can be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Classification includes assessment of certain clinical signs and symptoms, severity of the disease and its treatment according to the severity. For non‐severe pneumonia, the WHO recommends treatment with oral antibiotics. We used the 2014 WHO definition of non‐severe pneumonia for this review: an acute episode of cough, or difficulty in breathing, combined with fast breathing and chest indrawing. 
More commonly, pneumonia is caused by viruses that require supportive care rather than antibiotic treatment; however, pneumonia caused by bacteria should be treated with antibiotics to avoid complications. Since there is no clear way to quickly distinguish which organism actually caused the pneumonia, it is considered safe to give antibiotics. However, this may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, and limit their use in future infections. The question is whether the use of antibiotics is justified in non‐severe pneumonia.

Study characteristics 
We included three trials (3256 children). They were conducted in four hospitals in three cities in Pakistan (Islamabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi), and in hospital outpatient departments in India and Malawi. The children were treated with a three‐day course of amoxicillin (antibiotic) or placebo, and followed up for two weeks. One trial is awaiting classification.
