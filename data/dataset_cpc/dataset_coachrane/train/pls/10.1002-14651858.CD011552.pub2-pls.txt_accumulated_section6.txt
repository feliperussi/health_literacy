Can keeping the mouth cold during cancer treatment help to prevent mouth soreness and ulcers in children and adults? 
Review question 
This review has been produced to assess whether or not keeping the mouth cold during cancer treatment, by using ice, ice‐cold water, ice cream or ice lollies/popsicles, can help prevent mouth soreness and ulcers in children and adults. 
Background 
People receiving treatment for cancer are at risk of developing a sore mouth and ulcers as a side effect. This side effect is called oral mucositis and affects over 75% of high‐risk patients (those receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck or high‐dose chemotherapy). The pain caused by this condition can be severe and can stop the person's ability to eat and drink, which may mean they need to take strong pain killers, stay in hospital and be fed through a tube into their stomach, or even into their veins. This in turn can lead to disruption to their cancer treatment, meaning they are not receiving the best possible treatment. The results may be a reduction in the patient's chances of survival, and increased costs to the healthcare system. Cancer patients have weakened immune systems due to their treatment, meaning that their bodies are less able to fight infections. This can be a problem if bacteria enter the body through the ulcer, which is an open wound. This can lead to sepsis (a dangerous inflammatory reaction of the body to infection), which requires antibiotics and hospitalisation, and can cause death. 
Oral cryotherapy is the cooling of the mouth using ice, ice‐cold water, ice cream or ice lollies/popsicles. It is thought to help prevent oral mucositis in people receiving certain types of chemotherapy because the coldness makes the blood vessels in the mouth more narrow, and this reduces the amount of blood containing chemotherapy drugs from reaching the mouth and causing oral mucositis. It is a low‐cost, natural treatment without serious side effects.
