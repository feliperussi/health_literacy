Interventions for preventing hamstring injuries
Hamstring (muscles situated at the back of the thigh) injuries are common in sports such as football and basketball. These injuries are often serious, causing pain, long rehabilitation times and a distinct proneness to re‚Äêinjury. Various interventions targeting the prevention of such injuries are in common use. This review set out to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions in preventing hamstring injuries. 
Seven randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1919 participants were included. All trials involved people, predominantly young adults, participating in regular sporting activities. Some trials were compromised by poor methodology, including lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data. 
Four trials, including 287 participants, examined interventions directly targeted at preventing hamstring injuries. Three of these trials, which tested hamstring strengthening protocols, had contradictory findings and we could not conclude whether strengthening exercises of the hamstrings was beneficial or not. One small trial found that manual therapy (involving manipulation, massage and specific stretches to joints and muscles of the spine and leg) may prevent injuries of leg muscles, including the hamstrings. 
Three inconclusive trials tested interventions for preventing all leg injuries for which data for hamstring injury were available. Two trials found no evidence for an effect for balance training on a wobble board (proprioceptive protocol). One trial found no evidence for a warm up/cool down and stretching protocol for distance runners. 
Based on currently available research findings, no specific intervention can be recommended for decreasing the risk of incurring hamstring injuries.
