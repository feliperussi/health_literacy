Tooth‐coloured, non‐metallic fillings: is it better to repair or replace faulty non‐metallic fillings for adults? 
Review question 
Is it more effective to repair or replace faulty tooth‐coloured fillings (resin composite) placed in molar teeth towards the back of the mouth in adults? 
Background 
Fillings are used as part of general dental treatment to rebuild teeth after a patient develops tooth decay or damages the surface of their tooth in some way. 
Fillings also help to prevent further damage occurring (this can be through further tooth decay under the filling or from impact), but they must be maintained to ensure that the fillings continue to protect what is left of the original tooth. 
Tooth‐coloured filling materials have increasingly been used in many countries as an alternative to the more traditional amalgam or metallic fillings. As with any filling material these fillings have a limited life‐span and eventually problems will occur when they break down or become faulty. 
Traditionally faulty fillings have been replaced, however this approach may involve the loss of further bits of tooth as the cavity is emptied and re‐filled. 
An alternative approach is to repair the faulty filling. Repairing fillings may take less time, and as some repairs can be performed without the need to numb the area (local anaesthesia), a repair may be less distressing for the patient when compared with the option of replacing the filling. Issues such as pain, anxiety, distress, time and cost are important considerations for dentists as well as patients. 
This review aims to compare whether it is better to replace or repair resin composite fillings. The evidence for repair or replacement of amalgam fillings is contained in a separate review. 
Study characteristics 
This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current up to 24 July 2013.
