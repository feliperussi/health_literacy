Medical treatment of primary biliary cholangitis
Background 
Primary biliary cholangitis (previously called primary biliary cirrhosis) is a chronic liver disease caused by the destruction of small bile ducts within the liver (tubes that carry the bile produced by the liver) resulting in stagnation of bile (cholestasis) and liver damage and replacement of liver cells with scar tissue (liver cirrhosis). The best way to treat people with primary biliary cholangitis is unclear. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing trials on the topic. We included all randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more intervention groups) reported to February 2017. We included only trials in which participants with primary biliary cholangitis had not undergone liver transplantation previously. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we planned to use an advanced method which allows comparison of the many different treatments that are individually compared in the trials (network meta‐analysis). However, because of the nature of the information available, we could not determine whether the network meta‐analysis results were reliable. Therefore, we used standard Cochrane methodology. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 74 randomised clinical trials (5902 participants). Of these, 46 randomised clinical trials (4274 participants) provided information for one or more measures (outcomes). The trials included people with primary biliary cholangitis with and without symptoms; with and without antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) (an indicator of primary biliary cholangitis) regardless of whether they received previous treatments. The average follow‐up period in the trials ranged from one month to eight years in the trials that reported this information.
