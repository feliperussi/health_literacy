Mirtazapine for treating fibromyalgia in adults
Bottom line 
Mirtazapine at 15 mg to 45 mg daily is unlikely to substantially reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia. Mirtazapine can cause drowsiness, weight gain, and liver damage. A small number of people may experience some improvement (moderate pain relief, better sleep) without side effects from mirtazapine, but that cannot be predicted. The off‐label use of mirtazapine can be considered, if established treatment options have failed. 
Background 
People with fibromyalgia often have chronic (longer than 3 months) widespread pain, and problems with sleeping, thinking, exhaustion, and poor quality of life. There is no cure for fibromyalgia. Treatments aim to improve symptoms (pain, sleep problems, fatigue) and quality of life. 
Serotonin and noradrenaline are chemicals produced by the human body and are involved in pain, sleep, and mood. Low serotonin levels have been found in people with fibromyalgia. The antidepressant, mirtazapine, increases serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the brain. 
Study characteristics 
In July 2018 we searched for clinical trials where mirtazapine was used to treat fibromyalgia in adults. We found three studies with 606 participants. Studies were seven to 13 weeks long. They compared mirtazapine 15 mg to 45 mg daily against a fake medication (placebo). 
Key results 
There was no difference between mirtazapine and placebo for any primary outcome: mirtazapine and placebo reduced pain by 50% in two of 10 people (low‐quality evidence). Only one single serious adverse event was available for evaluation of safety (very low‐quality evidence). Three of 10 participants with mirtazapine and two of 10 participants with placebo dropped out of the trial due to side effects (low‐quality evidence).
