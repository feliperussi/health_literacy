Pegloticase for chronic gout
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of pegloticase on chronic gout. There was one study included in this review which looked at different doses. The review shows that: 
‐        it is unknown whether pegloticase can improve the pain and function of people with chronic gout. 
Even though there were no differences in improvement, no matter which dose of pegloticase was taken, the uric acid was better controlled in the 8 mg every 2 week dose.  In patients who had not responded to other medications, 90% of patients had below normal levels of uric acid at this dose.    
We often do not have precise information about side effects and adverse events. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects.  Possible side effects of pegloticase are kidney stones, joint pain and anemia. 
What is gout, and what is pegloticase? 
Gout is a sudden, very painful joint inflammation (arthritis) that usually affects the big toe.  Due to increase in the uric acid level in blood and then in the joints, urate crystals form on the joint and make it painful to move your toe or even to touch it.   A sudden attack of gout can sometimes be followed years later by chronic gout that affects both small and large joints of hands and feet.  
Pegloticase is meant to work by converting the urate crystals to something that will not form on the joints.  It might also enable the body to handle the urate crystals that have already built up on the joint.  Pegloticase is a new gout drug that is still under development. This means that it is currently not available because it is still being tested.
