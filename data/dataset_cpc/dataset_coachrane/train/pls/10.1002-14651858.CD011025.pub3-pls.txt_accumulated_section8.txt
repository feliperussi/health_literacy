Transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment of epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that appears in various forms. Many individuals with epilepsy have satisfactory seizure control with the use of antiepileptic medications. Yet, nearly a third of people with epilepsy suffer from frequent and uncontrolled seizures despite the use of medication, or are unable to tolerate the side effects of those medications. Surgery is an option for some people with uncontrolled seizures, but it is invasive and not suitable for all individuals. As a result, there remains a substantial unmet need for safe, effective therapies for these harder‐to‐treat epilepsies. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one of several newer treatments that can potentially offer people with epilepsy a safe and non‐invasive alternative to surgery. Long used as a research tool to study brain function, TMS has also been studied as a possible treatment for a number of nervous system conditions, including epilepsy. This non‐surgical and painless treatment uses induced magnetic currents to regulate brain function in order to reduce the tendency to have seizures. 
Objective 
We aimed in this review to evaluate the evidence for the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in individuals with epilepsy compared with other available treatments in reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, reducing epileptiform discharges (abnormalities on brain electrographic testing that suggest underlying brain disturbance or seizure tendency), antiepileptic medication use, and side effects. 
Methods 
The latest search for trials was 2 June 2020. We assessed the evidence from eight randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving a total of 241 participants comparing rTMS to control treatments (sham treatment, antiepileptic medication, or low‐frequency rTMS).
