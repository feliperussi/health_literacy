Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question 
Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed.
