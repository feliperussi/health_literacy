Interventions for reducing difficulty in swallowing in people with oesophageal cancer
Review question 
For most patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer, providing clinical benefit with palliative treatment is highly desirable. However, the optimal palliative technique for dysphagia improvement and better quality of life is not established. 
Background 
Dysphagia (difficulty or discomfort in swallowing) is common among patients with unresectable or inoperable oesophageal cancer. There are five levels of dysphagia, ranging from the ability to eat a normal diet to some solids, semisolids, liquids and to complete dysphagia. 
Study characteristics 
The review included randomised controlled studies comparing the use of different interventions to improve dysphagia among patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer. To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014). 
Key results 
The review updates the previous version but still fails to present any obvious superiority of one technique over another among the different kinds of interventions. Self‚Äêexpanding metal stents provided safer and more effective relief of dysphagia compared to rigid plastic stents. Other techniques like radiotherapy or brachytherapy were also suitable alternatives and might be favourable in improving quality of life and prolonging survival. Individual differences should be emphasised when the intervention type was determined. 
Quality of the evidence 
Half of the studies included in this review were of high quality. Most studies did not state the methods used to seek and report quality of life outcomes and adverse effects.
