Chest physiotherapy for acute bronchiolitis in children younger than two years of age 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of chest physiotherapy in infants younger than two years of age with acute bronchiolitis. 
Background 
Acute bronchiolitis is a frequent viral respiratory infection in children younger than two years of age. Most children have a mild disease and do not require hospitalisation. Those who do need to be hospitalised sometimes have difficulty clearing phlegm (thick mucous respiratory secretions caused by the infection). It has been proposed that chest physiotherapy may assist in the clearance of respiratory secretions and improve breathing. There are three different types of chest physiotherapy available: vibration and percussion, forced expiratory techniques and slow flow techniques that avoid blockage of the airway. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 2015. This review has included 12 trials with a total of 1249 participants. By type of chest physiotherapy, five trials tested vibration and percussion techniques in 246 participants, three trials tested forced expiratory techniques in 624 participants, and four trials tested slow flow techniques in 375 participants. 
Key results 
Vibration and percussion techniques produce a thorax (chest) oscillation by fast compression or percussion with the physiotherapist's hands. Neither manoeuvre was shown to improve the clinical scores of patients with acute bronchiolitis in the trials. These techniques did not show improvements in respiratory measurements, time on oxygen therapy or length of hospital stay. There were no data on time to recovery from acute bronchiolitis, use of bronchodilators or steroids, or parents' assessment of physiotherapy benefit. The trials included in this review did not present data on adverse effects related to the intervention, but the literature cites cases of relevant adverse effects such as rib fractures related to these techniques.
