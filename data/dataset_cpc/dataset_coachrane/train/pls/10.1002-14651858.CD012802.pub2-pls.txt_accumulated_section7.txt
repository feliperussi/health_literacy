Does placing a tiny tube (microstent) under the surface of the eye relieve long‐lasting high pressure inside the eye (glaucoma)? 
What is open‐angle glaucoma?Glaucoma is a common eye condition caused by fluid building up in the front part of the eye, which increases pressure inside the eye. The increased pressure damages the nerve that connects the eye to the brain (optic nerve), causing loss of sight. Glaucoma can lead to permanent loss of sight (blindness) if it is not diagnosed and treated early. 
Open‐angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma and tends to develop slowly over many years. It is caused by drainage channels in the eye gradually becoming blocked over time. 
Treatments for glaucomaTreatment cannot reverse any loss of sight that happened before glaucoma was diagnosed but can slow or stop loss of sight. All treatments for glaucoma aim to reduce the pressure in the eye. These include: 
‐ medicines, given as eye‐drops;‐ laser treatment to reduce the production of fluid and open up blocked drainage channels; or‐ surgery to drain fluid from the eye. 
One treatment involves placing a tiny tube (called a microstent) under the surface of the eye to create a drainage channel for excess fluid. Microstents can often be placed during surgery to treat cataracts: cloudy patches that develop on the lens inside the eye and make sight misty and blurred. 
Why we did this Cochrane ReviewPlacing a microstent may lower pressure inside the eye and reduce the need for eye‐drop medicines or for other types of surgery that may have greater risks. We wanted to find out if placing a microstent during cataract surgery would lower pressure inside the eye in people with open‐angle glaucoma.
