Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia is defined as "sudden usually unilateral severe brief stabbing recurrent pains in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve". It has an incidence rate of 12.6 per 100,000 person years and more commonly affects older age groups. The fifth cranial nerve is one of the largest in the head. The nerve is called trigeminal because it splits into three main branches. It provides sensation to the face. When neuralgia (nerve pain) occurs in the trigeminal nerve it causes severe and sudden face pain. 
The causes of trigeminal neuralgia are unclear. Treatment of all people with classical trigeminal neuralgia begins with drug therapy, most frequently using one of several drugs also used to treat epilepsy, among which the gold standard remains carbamazepine. If drug therapy fails then surgical interventions may be used. Surgical treatments divide into two main categories: ablative (destroying the nerve) or non‐ablative (preserving nerve function and relieving the pressure on the nerve). These procedures result in pain relief for variable lengths of time. 
For this review, we searched for all of the surgical procedures for trigeminal neuralgia. We found 11 studies, which included 496 patients, but only three had sufficient outcome data to report. These three studies, which involved a total of 181 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review. The primary aim of all three studies was to determine if one technique was better than the other. All three included studies evaluated destructive techniques. None of the three studies evaluated the non‐destructive procedure of microvascular decompression and this is a major drawback in the literature.
