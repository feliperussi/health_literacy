Antidepressants for chronic non‐cancer pain in children and adolescents
Bottom line 
We are uncertain as to whether antidepressants provide pain relief for chronic non‐cancer pain in children and adolescents. We do not have evidence to suggest that one type of antidepressant is more effective than another. 
Background 
Children can experience chronic or recurrent pain related to genetic conditions, nerve damage, muscle or bone pain, stomach pain, as well as for unknown reasons. Chronic pain is pain that lasts three months or longer and is commonly accompanied by changes in lifestyle and functional abilities, as well as by signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
Antidepressants have been used for pain relief and pain management since the 1970s and are considered by clinicians to be useful for symptoms of nerve, menstrual, muscular, joint, and stomach pain. Examples of antidepressants that have been used to treat neuropathic pain include amitriptyline, milnacipran, and citalopram. 
Study characteristics 
In September 2016 we searched for clinical trials in which antidepressants were used to treat chronic nerve, menstrual, muscular, joint, or stomach pain. We found four trials with a total of 272 participants (aged 6 to 18 years old) who had nerve pain, general painful inflammation, stomach pain, or irritable bowel syndrome, for more than 3 months. 
Key results 
No studies reported on pain relief of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater. Side effects were uncommon, and occurred only as mild reactions such as nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, and abdominal discomfort (4 due to amitriptyline, 5 due to citalopram, 1 due to gabapentin, and 1 due to placebo). These 11 participants withdrew from the study due to these mild side effects. There were no serious side effects.
