Certolizumab pegol for the treatment of active Crohn’s disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of using certolizumab pegol in people with active Crohn’s disease. 
Background 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract such as the small and large intestine. Common symptoms of Crohn’s disease are chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. When patients with Crohn’s disease have symptoms, the condition is considered to be 'active'. When in 'remission', patients do not have symptoms. 
Certolizumab pegol is a biologic medication used to modify the excessive immune response that causes chronic inflammation in Crohn’s disease. Certolizumab pegol is usually injected under the skin every 2 to 4 weeks. 
Study characteristics 
The literature was searched up to 28 January 2019. Four studies involving 1485 patients compared certolizumab pegol with placebo (a dummy drug). All studies included patients with active Crohn’s disease. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age, except for six patients aged 16 or 17 years old. All studies were funded by the drug manufacturer. 
Key results 
In a combined analysis of the four studies, patients with active Crohn’s disease who received certolizumab pegol at a dose ranging from 100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks, responded to the treatment and achieved remission at 8 weeks more often than patients taking placebo. No remarkable difference in the rate of serious side effects was observed between certolizumab pegol and placebo. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease, infections, and malignancy (i.e. cancer). 
Quality of the evidence 
Moderate certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol is beneficial in terms of achieving remission in people with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Because of a low number of serious side effects, the certainty of evidence about harms of certolizumab pegol was moderate.
