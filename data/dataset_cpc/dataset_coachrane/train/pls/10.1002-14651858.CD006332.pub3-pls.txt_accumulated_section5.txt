Mu‐opioid antagonists for bowel dysfunction due to opioids in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care 
Background 
Opioids (morphine‐like drugs) are used to treat severe pain. Unfortunately, they cause side effects. Opioid‐induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is a term used to describe constipation, incomplete evacuation of the bowels, bloating, and increased reflux (flowing back) of stomach contents. OIBD may be so severe that a person chooses to limit opioid treatment to improve bowel function. OIBD is common in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care (care given to people with a terminal illness when a cure is no longer possible). Laxatives are often the first‐choice treatment for OIBD. They may not always work. Mu‐opioid antagonists (MOA) are specific medicines for OIBD. Clinical guidelines may recommend them when laxatives fail. 
Trial characteristics 
The aim of this updated review was to determine what we know about the effectiveness and safety of MOA for the management of OIBD in people with cancer and people receiving palliative care and for whom laxatives have failed. A possible side effect of an MOA is reduced pain relief from opioids; therefore, we looked at its impact on pain relief. We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are well‐designed clinical trials that provide the most reliable evidence. RCTs needed to evaluate an MOA, such as the medicines naldemedine, methylnaltrexone, and naloxone. The trial comparison groups could be a placebo (a substance with no known active effect), usual care, or another treatment such as a different type of MOA.
