Blood pressure drugs for preventing stroke and cardiovascular diseases in patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 
Questions 
Do blood pressure drugs prevent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)? What blood pressure target is best for preventing stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia, in people with a stroke or TIA? 
Background 
Stroke, due to blocked or bleeding blood vessels in the brain affects about 14 million people worldwide each year. Stroke survivors are at increased risk of recurrent stroke, other blood vessel diseases, and dementia. High blood pressure is an important risk factor that can increase this risk. Blood pressure‐lowering drugs are known to prevent first ever stroke. However, in stroke survivors lowering the blood pressure too far (using blood pressure drugs) may be harmful especially early after the stroke. Therefore, we reviewed trials that tested blood pressure‐lowering drugs started at least 48 hours after the stroke or TIA. 
Study characteristics: this review is up‐to‐date to August 2017. We included 11 trials involving 38,742 participants: eight trials assessed the effect of blood pressure drugs, and three trials compared different blood pressure targets. Ten studies were hospital‐based and one trial was performed in a general practitioner setting. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes. 
Key results: blood pressure drugs lowered the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a stroke or TIA, whereas there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they reduce the risk of other blood vessel diseases and dementia. There is also insufficient evidence to conclude which blood pressure target is best for patients with a stroke or TIA.
