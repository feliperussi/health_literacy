Addition of intravenous beta2‐agonists to inhaled beta2‐agonists for acute asthma
Beta2‐agonist drugs are used for the treatment of asthma and work by opening the airways to help people breathe more easily.  Beta2‐agonists can be given to people in two different ways – intravenously (directly thorough a vein) and via an inhaler.  Inhalers are one of the most important treatments for people with acute severe asthma. The question this review considered was whether treatment would offer additional benefit if  patients received these drugs both ways (by breathing them via an inhaler and receiving them directly through a vein) than by just inhaling them alone. This review examined all the randomised controlled trials on the use of intravenous beta2‐agonists in addition to inhaled beta2‐agonists with existing standard care (such as steroids either taken as tablets of by injection) in severe acute asthma.    
We found three trials involving 104 people (75 children and 29 adults) with acute asthma. There was no significant difference in adults receiving intravenous beta‐agonists as well as standard care in the one small trial considering this comparison. We also looked at length of stay in the emergency department. Two reported shorter recovery time or quicker discharge from the emergency department in patients also receiving intravenous beta‐agonists. One trial reported that more children experienced tremor if they had received injected beta‐agonists whereas another trial, with adults, reported no significant difference in adverse effects. As there are so few trials and so few included patients we cannot be sure about the reliability of these findings. 
This review found that until more, larger, high quality clinical trials in this area are conducted it is not possible to judge whether there is any enhanced benefit using additional intravenous beta2‐agonists in children or adults with severe acute asthma compared with inhaled beta2‐agonists alone.
