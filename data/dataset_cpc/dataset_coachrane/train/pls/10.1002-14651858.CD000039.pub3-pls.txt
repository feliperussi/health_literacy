Drug interventions for deliberately altering blood pressure in acute stroke
Background: In people who have just had a stroke (a sudden brain attack due to either blockage or rupture of an artery in the brain), very high and very low blood pressures may be harmful. Therefore, drugs that raise low blood pressure or lower high blood pressure might be beneficial. Up to 50% of people admitted with acute stroke are taking blood pressure tablets on hospital admission and it is not clear whether these medications should be continued or discontinued in the acute situation. This review looked at those trials that deliberately altered blood pressure or compared continuing or stopping blood pressure‐lowering tablets taken before stroke. 
Study characteristics: This review is up‐to‐date to May 2014. We included 26 trials involving 17,011 participants: 24 trials assessed lowering blood pressure, one trial tested raising blood pressure, and two trials assessed what to do with drugs taken before stroke. All studies took place in hospitals that were used to treating people with stroke. Not all trials contributed information to all outcomes, and we have used data that were available in publications. 
Key results: There is insufficient evidence to say that lowering blood pressure saves lives or reduces disability in people with acute stroke. Immediately restarting blood pressure‐lowering drugs taken before the stroke may increase disability. 
Conclusion: More research is needed to identify those people who are most likely to benefit from altering blood pressure in acute stroke, the time window in which the treatment is likely to be of benefit, what types of stroke are likely to respond favourably, and the environment in which such treatment may be best given in routine practice.
