Surgery for complete rectal prolapse in adults
Importance of the review  
Complete, or full‐thickness rectal prolapse is when the lower part of the intestine (the rectum) becomes loose and telescopes out of the anus when straining. It should not be confused with haemorrhoids (or piles), which is when the veins around the anus swell up. Rectal prolapse is most common in older people, especially women, although its cause is unclear. Rectal prolapse can cause complications, such as pain, ulcers, bleeding and faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements). Surgery is a common treatment for repairing the prolapse. 
The main findings of the review  
Whether surgery is performed through a cut in the abdomen or a cut through the anus (known as a perineal approach), it makes no difference with regard to reappearance of the prolapse or appearance of postoperative complications. When surgeons perform the operation through a small hole in the abdomen (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery) recovery may be faster than for open abdominal surgery. When constipation is one of the main symptoms, bowel resection (removing part of the bowel) during prolapse repair may help. There was no difference in the results when different types of repair were used during the perineal (anal) approach. 
Adverse effects  
There was no particular concern about different types of surgery described in this review. 
Limitations of the review  
Although 15 studies were included in this review, many of them had different comparisons and some had poor methods, limiting the usefulness of the findings. However, longer follow‐up of patients in these studies, together with results from ongoing trials, may provide some information in the future.
