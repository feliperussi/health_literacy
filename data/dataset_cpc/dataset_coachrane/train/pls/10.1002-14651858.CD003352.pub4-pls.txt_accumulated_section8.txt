Dopamine agonists for the treatment of people who misuse cocaine
Background 
A pharmacological agent with proven efficacy does not exist for treatment of cocaine misuse. Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the erythroxylon coca leaf that is used as powder for intranasal or intravenous use or as crack, a free‐base form which is smoked. Cocaine misuse is a major public health problem because its use can be associated with medical and psychosocial complications including the spread of infectious diseases (such as AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis), crime, violence and neonatal drug exposure. In this Cochrane Review we looked at the evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists as a treatment, used either alone or in combination with any psychosocial intervention, for people addicted to cocaine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases and internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (where participants are allocated at random to any dopamine agonist drug or placebo or another type of drug aimed to reduce use of cocaine. We also assessed dropout from treatment and frequency of side effects. We included adults of any gender, age or ethnicity. 
Key results 
We included 24 studies with 2147 participants, who were all addicted to cocaine. Most were men (82.%)with an average age of 37 years. The mean duration of the included trials was seven weeks (range 1.5 to 16 weeks) Twenty‐two studies were conducted in USA, one in Brazil and one in Spain; all but four were outpatients. 
The included trials studied the following drugs: amantadine, bromocriptine, L dopa/Carbidopa, pergolide, cabergoline hydergine, and pramipexole. All compared dopamine agonist versus placebo. Four studies compared amantidine versus antidepressants.
