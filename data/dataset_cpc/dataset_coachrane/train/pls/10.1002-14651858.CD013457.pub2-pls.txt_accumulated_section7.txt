Is D‐cycloserine effective and safe for social and communication skills deficits in people with ASD? 
What is the aim of this review? 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively common disorder involving the abnormal development of the brain. It often leads to repetitive behaviours, restrictive activities, limited interests, reduced social functioning and language skills. There are no effective treatments for these features of ASD but recent research suggests that D‐cycloserine might improve social and communication skills in people with ASD. D‐cycloserine is a type of medicine used to treat tuberculosis (a contagious infection that usually affects the lungs) and schizophrenia (a serious mental disorder of thought, emotion and behaviour).  We wanted to know whether D‐cycloserine, alone or in combination with other treatment, was better or worse than placebo (dummy pill) at improving social and communication skills in individuals with ASD. We also wanted to know if there were any harmful side effects from using this medication.  
Key messages 
There appears to be no clear difference between D‐cycloserine plus social skills training and social skills training alone on social and communication skills in individuals with ASD. However, we are uncertain about these results. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched databases of scientific studies and found one relevant study to include in this review. The study took place in the USA and did not have industry funding. A total of 67 children aged 5 to 11 years were included in the study. One group took a medicine called D‐cycloserine once a week plus social skills training, and the other group took a placebo pill (dummy pill which does not include medicine) plus social skills training. The treatment lasted for 10 weeks.
