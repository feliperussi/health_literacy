Tube feeding (mainly via the nose into the stomach or directly into the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We planned to review the evidence about the effects of tube feeding (via either the nose or the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes damage to the lungs and pancreas (an organ needed to produce chemicals that help to digest food). People with cystic fibrosis often need more calories in order to achieve a good nutritional status because their condition means food is not absorbed well and they burn more energy at rest and when breathing than people who don't have cystic fibrosis. They also often have poor appetites. Supplements are often given via a tube which is either placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric feeding) or directly into the stomach (gastrostomy feeding)), often overnight but sometimes during the day too. This type of feeding helps to improve weight gain, nutritional status, lung function and may improve quality of life. This is important as it is known that in cystic fibrosis nutritional status is closely linked to lung function. However, tube feeding is expensive and may also impact on self‚Äêesteem and body image. Tubes through the nose may also become dislodged by coughing. Tube feeding may also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but these issues are usually resolved by either changing the type of feed, the rate of feeding or the way pancreatic enzymes are given. This is a final update of a previously published review.
