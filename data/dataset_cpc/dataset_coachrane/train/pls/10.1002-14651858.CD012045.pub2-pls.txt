Partial nephrectomy for the treatment of clinically localised renal carcinomas
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence to compare the effects of removing only the tumour (partial nephrectomy) versus removing the entire kidney (radical nephrectomy) in individuals with a small kidney cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body. 
Background 
Small kidney tumours are often discovered on imaging studies (like CT scans) ordered for other reasons. Some of these tumours are cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, cause problems like bleeding or pain and even lead to death. The best way to treat these tumours is surgery that removes the tumour. This can be done by just removing the tumour (and some of the surrounding tissue) or by removing the tumour and the whole kidney. We do not know what is better. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature until 24 February 2017. We included one study with 541 study participants that randomly assigned participants with localised tumours of the kidney that were thought to be cancerous. On average, participants were followed for 9.3 years. 
Key results 
Participants who had only the tumour taken out appear to be more likely to die from any cause than participants that had the tumour and the whole kidney taken out. There appeared to be little to no difference in the time until the tumour comes back or in the risk of serious complications resulting in death. We did not find any evidence as to how the groups compared when it comes to the need for haemodialysis or how their quality of life compared. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low. This means that we have limited confidence in the results and that the true effect of partial nephrectomy may be substantially different.
