Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women
What is the issue? 
Breastfeeding is expected to provide for the infant's needs in the early months of life. However, if the mother is undernourished herself, the infant may not receive all the nutrients they need. Vitamin A is important for immunity and helping the infant stay healthy, so if the mother does not have enough vitamin A intake in her diet, the infant may also not receive enough in the breast milk. 
Why is this important? 
In areas where vitamin A deficiency is a public health concern, the maternal dietary intake of vitamin A may be not sufficient to meet either the maternal nutritional requirements, or those of the breastfed infant, due the low concentrations in breast milk. Many studies have been carried out to address this concern in countries where vitamin A deficiency is common. 
What evidence did we find? 
We reviewed 14 trials. The evidence in general was found was to be of low quality. These studies involved the mothers being given vitamin A or not, within the first six weeks after giving birth, or compared a high dose of vitamin A with a low dose. Our review looked at the overall health of the mothers and their infants, any adverse effects and the levels of retinol, which is a by‚Äêproduct of vitamin A, in the mother's breast milk. There was no change in how many mothers or babies died or were unwell. The mothers and their babies did not experience adverse effects. There was evidence of improved amounts of retinol in breast milk.
