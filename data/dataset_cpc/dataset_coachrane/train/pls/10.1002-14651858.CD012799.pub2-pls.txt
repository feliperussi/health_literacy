Selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors for premature ejaculation
Review question 
We wanted to find out if medicines called selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used mostly to treat depression, can help men that ejaculate faster than they want, to slow down. 
Background 
Premature ejaculation is a common problem among men, that occurs when ejaculation happens sooner than a man or his partner would like during sex; it may cause unhappiness and relationship problems. SSRIs are medicines that are often given to help treat premature ejaculation, but we do not understand how well they actually work and what unwanted effects they might cause. 
Study characteristics 
We studied the evidence up to 1 May 2020. We found 31 studies with 8254 men. The studies compared SSRIs to placebo (a pill with inactive ingredients). 
Key results 
SSRIs probably improve sexual satisfaction for men with premature ejaculation compared to placebo. They probably also improve the sense of control over ejaculation and decrease unhappiness and relationship problems. However, they likely increase side effects. 
Quality of evidence 
We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate for SSRIs, helping men’s sense of change with treatment, happiness with intercourse, and feeling of control over ejaculation. The quality of evidence was also moderate for medicine side effects. These results mean that our evaluation is likely to be close to the truth. However, the evidence on improving relationship problems and the time to ejaculation is of low certainty. This means that the true effect of treatment on those two concerns could be different from the results of this review. That may be caused by weaknesses and variations in the studies we examined.
