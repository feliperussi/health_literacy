Early discharge with home support of gavage feeding for stable preterm infants who have not established full oral feeds 
Review question: Does a policy of early discharge of stable preterm infants with home support of gavage feeding compared with a policy of discharge of such infants when they have reached full sucking feeds lead to improvement in feeding, growth and other clinical outcomes? 
Background: Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks) are not usually discharged from hospital until they are able to suck all their feeds. Early discharge of babies who are stable but still need gavage (tube) feeds could unite families sooner and might reduce costs. These babies could graduate to full sucking feeds at home with some professional support. However, this practice could present a burden for the family and might increase complications during the transition from tube feeding. 
Study characteristics: Data from one quasi‐randomised trial with 88 infants from 75 families were included in the review. 
Key results: Infants in the early discharge programme with home gavage feeds had a mean hospital stay that was approximately nine days shorter than that of infants in the control group. Infants in the early discharge programme also had lower risk of clinical infection during the home gavage period compared with infants in the control group during the corresponding time in hospital. No significant differences were observed between groups in duration and extent of breast feeding, weight gain, re‐admission within the first 12 months post discharge from the home gavage programme or from hospital, scores reflecting parental satisfaction or health service use. 
Conclusions: Evidence is needed regarding the effects of early home discharge for preterm babies who are stable but still need gavage (tube) feeds.
