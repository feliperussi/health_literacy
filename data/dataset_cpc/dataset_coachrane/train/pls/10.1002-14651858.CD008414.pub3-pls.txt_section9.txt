We found 14 studies (1867 participants). One study was judged to be of high quality, six studies were of low quality and seven were judged to be unclear as authors reported insufficient information to allow a judgement. People who took 5‐ASA had fewer relapses than people who had no maintenance treatment. At 12 months, 36% (20/55) of participants in the 5‐ASA group relapsed compared to 51% (28/55) in the no treatment control group (1 study, low certainty evidence). Moderate quality evidence from five studies showed that 5‐ASA drugs are superior to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) for maintaining surgically‐induced remission of Crohn's disease. During a follow‐up period of 12 to 72 months, 36% (131/361) of 5‐ASA participants relapsed compared to 43% (160/369) of placebo participants. The analysis of four studies that compared 5‐ASA medications to purine antimetabolites (i.e. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine ‐ both immunosuppressive drugs) found no difference in the proportion of participants that remained in remission, although the overall quality of evidence was low. At 24 months, 61% (103/170) of 5‐ASA participants relapsed compared to 67% (119/177) of purine antimetabolite participants. People who took high dose 5‐ASA had fewer relapses than those who took lower dose 5‐ASA. At 12 months, 17% (17/101) of the 4 g/day 5‐ASA group relapsed compared to 26% (27/105) of the 2.4 g/day group (1 study, moderate certainty evidence). The analysis of the single small study that compared 5‐ASA and adalimumab (a biologic drug) showed that 5‐ASA was inferior to adalimumab for maintaining surgically‐induced remission of Crohn's disease. At 24 months, 50% (9/18) of 5‐ASA participants relapsed compared to 13% (2/16) in the adalimumab group (very low certainty evidence). The analysis of two studies that compared sulphasalazine to placebo found no difference in relapse rates. After 18 to 36 months, 66% (95/143) of sulphasalazine participants relapsed compared to 71% (110/155) of placebo participants (low certainty evidence). There was no difference in rates of side effects, serious side effects and withdrawal due to side effects when 5‐ASA was compared to placebo. 5‐ASA was safer than purine analogues resulting in less serious side effects and discontinuation of treatment due to side effects. Commonly reported side effects included diarrhoea, nausea, increased liver function tests, pancreatitis and abdominal pain.
