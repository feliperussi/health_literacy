Fast‐track interventions of low‐dose opioid‐based general anaesthesia and early tracheal extubation in adults undergoing cardiac surgery 
Review question 
Fast‐track cardiac care involves early removal, within eight hours of heart surgery, of the tube that provides mechanical breathing support (called early tracheal extubation) to enable cardiac surgery. This review examined evidence on the effectiveness and safety of fast‐track care compared with conventional (not fast‐track) care. We have updated the published evidence that we identified in 2012. It is now current to March 2016. 
Background 
In the past, adults were given high‐dose opioid‐based anaesthesia for cardiac surgery and were provided with mechanical breathing support overnight in an intensive care unit after surgery. Now, many surgical units remove the tube that provides mechanical breathing support when the patient is on the operating table or within hours after cardiac surgery. They use time‐directed protocols for removing breathing support. Some patients recover in an intensive care unit (ICU) or in a dedicated unit outside the ICU. It is important to improve hospital efficiency by using safe fast‐track interventions. 
Study characteristics 
We found 28 relevant randomized controlled studies, conducted between 1994 and 2015. Most of the 4438 adults who participated in these studies were undergoing first‐time elective coronary artery graft bypass or valve replacement surgery, or both. They were at low to moderate risk of death after surgery. Eighteen studies examined the use of low‐dose opioid‐based general anaesthesia. Sixteen studies assessed how effective the protocols were in guiding staff to remove the tube that provided breathing support within eight hours after surgery.
