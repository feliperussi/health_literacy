Mucolytic drugs (to help make phlegm easier to cough up) for people with bronchiectasis
Review question: This review considered the question of whether mucolytics may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis who do not also have cystic fibrosis. Studies of participants with cystic fibrosis were not included in this review, and we are unable to draw any conclusions on this treatment's relevance to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background: Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in lung structure, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties. Mucolytic drugs break down phlegm, which can make it easier to cough up. 
Study characteristics: Four studies (with a total of 528 participants) were identified that met the inclusion criterion of comparing mucolytic treatment versus no mucolytic treatment. All studies were conducted in adults. One study considered bromhexine versus placebo, two compared RhDNase versus placebo (one for a period of two weeks and the other over a period of 24 weeks) and the fourth compared erdosteine with physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone in elderly patients. The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that only descriptions of the individual studies were possible with very limited opportunities for combining the studies in single analyses. 
Key results: No strong evidence is available to support the use of these drugs in people with bronchiectasis (from causes other than cystic fibrosis); however it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions, as so few studies have been reported.
