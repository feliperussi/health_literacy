There are many ways of performing a caesarean section and the techniques used depend on a number factors including the clinical situation and the preference of the operator. The peritoneum is a thin membrane of cells supported by a thin layer of connective tissue, and during caesarean section these peritoneal surfaces have to be cut through in order to reach the uterus and for the baby to be born. Following a caesarean section, it has been standard practice to close the peritoneum by stitching (suturing) the two layers of tissue that line the abdomen and cover the internal organs, to restore the anatomy. It has however been suggested that peritoneal adhesions may be more likely rather than less likely when the peritoneum is sutured, possibly as a result of a tissue reaction to the suture material. This review of trials sought to address whether to routinely suture these thin layers of tissue or not after delivering a baby by caesarean section. Twenty‐nine randomised controlled trials were identified, with differences in their methodological quality; 21 trials involving over 17,000 women contributing data to the review. Several minutes were saved when the peritoneum was not stitched, and with a shorter period of hospital stay in most of the women. Postoperative adhesion formation was assessed in only four trials with 282 women, and no difference was found when leaving both layers of peritoneum unclosed was compared with closure of both. Longer‐term outcomes were not adequately assessed, particularly adhesion formation, subfertility and ease of other surgeries in later life. Although the methodological quality of trials was variable, the results were in general consistent between the trials of better and poorer quality. Further studies are needed to further assess all these outcomes.
