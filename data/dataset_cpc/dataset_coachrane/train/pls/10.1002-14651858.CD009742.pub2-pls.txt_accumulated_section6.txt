Does a local anaesthetic injection in children and young people having dental treatment under general anaesthetic reduce pain after treatment? 
Review question 
Do injections of local anaesthetic given whilst children and young people (aged 17 years or younger) are having dental treatment under general anaesthetic reduce the amount of pain felt afterwards? 
Background 
It can be difficult when giving dental treatment to children and young people to do it simply using a local anaesthetic (LA) injection. The problem is often that they are too anxious or that they need a lot of treatment at once: For example, they may need many teeth taken out at the same time. In these circumstances, a dental practitioner commonly uses a general anaesthetic (GA) and administers the treatment in a hospital. In England, there are over 30,000 hospital admissions per year for children who need teeth taken out under a GA. 
Problems often arise following this treatment and the most common is pain, the experience of which can cause an emotional as well as a physical response. The experience can make it more difficult for the dental practitioner to give the treatment needed, and it can also cause the child or young person to avoid dental treatment. It is thought that giving LA injections during dental treatment under GA will result in numbness and therefore pain not being felt for a couple of hours, after which time painkillers can control the pain. However, it is not clear what the benefits of using LA in this way are. Some undesired side‚Äêeffects, such as discomfort; dribbling, and accidental lip biting, have been reported. Also, because painkillers are often used as well, the effect of the LA is not clearly defined. Additionally, it is important to clarify the best doses and kind of injections to use to achieve the maximum benefit.
