Timing of treatment for people with recent symptoms from neck artery narrowing
Background 
Ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked from part of the brain. This can be caused by a disease in the neck (carotid) artery that can cause a severe narrowing of the artery, leading to blood clot formation and blockage of a smaller blood vessel downstream. Opening up the carotid artery can reestablish adequate blood flow by surgical removal of the diseased area, or by inserting a tube (stent) to open the artery. 
There is uncertainty about whether to perform the treatment immediately, or to wait a few days. Early treatment can improve blood flow, and prevent new strokes. However, early treatment may carry a higher risk of causing a stroke or associated bleeding. 
Review question 
We reviewed the effectiveness of performing very early treatment (within two days) compared with delayed treatment (after two days) for individuals with recent symptoms from neck (carotid) artery narrowing. 
Study characteristics 
The searches are up‐to‐date to 26 January 2016. We found only one randomized trial that assessed the effect of the timing of surgery. It included a total of 40 participants, ranging in age from 47 to 84 years. 
Key results 
From the limited evidence available, we cannot tell if the timing of surgery is an important factor in determining the outcome for individuals with recent symptoms from carotid artery narrowing. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is not enough evidence on the best time for surgical treatment for people with recent symptoms from carotid artery narrowing. The overall quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of participants from only one trial and missing outcome data. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed.
