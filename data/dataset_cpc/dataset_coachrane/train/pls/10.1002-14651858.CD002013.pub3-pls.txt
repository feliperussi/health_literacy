Does monitoring oxygen level with a pulse oximeter during and after surgery improve patient outcomes? 
Oxygen is carried around the body attached to haemoglobin in the blood. By passing light through the skin, pulse oximeters monitor how much oxygen the blood is carrying. Hypoxaemia—when the level of oxygen in the blood falls below optimal levels—is a risk during surgery when patient breathing and ventilation may be affected by anaesthesia or other drugs. Medical staff often monitor patients during and after surgery using pulse oximetry, but it is not clear whether this practise reduces the risk of adverse events after surgery. We reviewed the evidence on the effect of pulse oximeters on outcomes of surgical patients. In this update of the review, the search is current to June 2013. We identified five studies in which a total of 22,992 participants had been allocated at random to be monitored or not monitored with a pulse oximeter. These studies were not similar enough for their results to be combined statistically. Study results showed that although pulse oximetry can detect a deficiency of oxygen in the blood, its use does not affect a person's cognitive function and does not reduce the risk of complications or of dying after anaesthesia. These studies were large enough to show a reduction in complications, and care was taken to ensure that outcomes were assessed in the same way in both groups. The studies were conducted in developed countries, where standards of anaesthesia and nursing care are high. It is possible that pulse oximetry may have a greater impact on outcomes in other geographical areas with less comprehensive provision of health care.
