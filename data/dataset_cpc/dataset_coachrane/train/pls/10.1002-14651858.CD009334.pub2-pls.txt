Trials of interventions for pregnant women who are obese to lose weight and improve pregnancy outcomes. 
Pregnant women who are obese risk serious complications for themselves and their children. The mother is more likely to develop diabetes or high blood pressure or pre‚Äêeclampsia during pregnancy, and the pregnancy may end in a miscarriage or stillbirth. The baby could have serious anomalies at birth, including spina bifida, cardiovascular anomalies, cleft lip and palate, or limb reduction anomalies. Some obese women have premature births. At birth, the labour may be longer and other complications can lead to a caesarean birth. The baby may also be bigger at birth than is normal, and there is evidence that the children of obese mothers go on to be obese. The advice for obese women in managing their weight during pregnancy is that weight loss should be avoided, and weight gain should be between 5.0 and 9.1 kg. Yet observational studies of large numbers of pregnant women indicate that some obese women, especially those who are heavier, lose weight during pregnancy. We do not have any clear results that indicate that losing weight when pregnant is safe for a mother who is obese, or for her baby. This Cochrane review aimed to evaluate trials that were designed for obese pregnant women to lose weight. No randomised controlled trials were found. We recommend that further research is conducted to evaluate the safety of interventions for weight loss when a woman is pregnant and obese for the mother and her baby.
