In IVF, does transferring the embryo in media containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid result in more live births? 
What is IVF? 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a fertility treatment that helps people with fertility problems to have a baby. During IVF an egg from a woman's ovaries is fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The egg can be placed in a dish with multiple sperm to fertilise it, or a single sperm can be injected directly into it (intracytoplasmic sperm injection; ICSI). The fertilised egg (an embryo) is then placed (implanted) into the woman's womb to grow and develop. 
The embryo is transferred to the womb in a special transfer media, a solution containing compounds that help the embryo stick (adhere) successfully to the inside of the womb (implantation). Hyaluronic acid is a natural compound found in the body that acts as a binding and protective agent in tissues. It is often added to embryo transfer media to help implant the embryo. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether using transfer media with high concentrations of adherence compounds for embryo transfer such as hyaluronic acid improves success in implanting embryos, resulting in more live births. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of embryo transfer media containing different concentrations of hyaluronic acid in IVF/ICSI. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies in which the treatments received are decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We assessed the evidence by looking at how the studies were conducted, study sizes, and whether study findings were consistent.
