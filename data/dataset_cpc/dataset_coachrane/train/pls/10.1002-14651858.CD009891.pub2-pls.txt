Warmed fluids for preventing hypothermia during operations
During surgical operations, patients may become cold as the result of a combination of factors including the action of anaesthetic drugs, the presence of uncovered skin and the administration of cold fluids into the veins or to parts of the body where surgery is taking place to wash them. Becoming cold during surgery can be unpleasant and can cause excessive shivering after the operation. It can also cause heart problems and bleeding problems and can contribute to problems with pressure sores and wound healing and longer hospital stay. This review seeks to find out whether warming the fluids given into veins or used to wash parts of the body may prevent patients from becoming cold. 
We searched medical databases up until February 2014 to find studies comparing warmed fluids with unwarmed fluids and other methods of warming the patient. We found 24 relevant trials with 1250 adult patients undergoing all types of surgery. We did not include studies for which it was intended that the patient would become cold (such as to facilitate heart bypass surgery). We had intended to collect data on which patients became hypothermic (when their body temperature dropped to below 36 degrees Celsius), but no trials reported this, so we collected data on patient temperatures at various time points throughout surgery. 
We found evidence of moderate quality showing that if patients had the fluids they were given into their veins warmed up, they were about half a degree Celsius warmer and shivered less than those who received unwarmed fluids; however, we were unable to show a significant difference in patients who received warmed fluids to wash out parts of their bodies. 
We have demonstrated that warming fluids does keep adult patients warmer; however it is unclear whether this alone can make a difference in the severe complications that becoming cold may cause.
