Atrial natriuretic peptide for preventing and treating acute kidney injury
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a generic term for an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function resulting in retention of nitrogenous (urea and creatinine) and a fall in urine output. Sepsis (infection), shock, trauma, kidney stones, kidney infection, drug toxicity or drug abuse are common causes of AKI. AKI is common in hospitalised patients, with the overall incidence of AKI estimated to be around 24‐30 cases/1000 hospital discharges and 6% of those are critically ill. Sepsis, hypovolaemia, drug toxicity, major surgery and diagnostic investigations using radiocontrast dyes are some of the most common associated causes of hospital‐acquired AKI. Restoration of kidney function is the goal of any treatment and can involve drug interventions or kidney dialysis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to increase urine production and to reduce kidney inflammation. The aim of this review was to investigate the use of ANP in preventing AKI and treating established AKI. We identified 19 studies (11 prevention and 8 treatment) using low or high dose ANP, enrolling 1,861 patients. There was no difference in the number of deaths between ANP and control for studies preventing or treating AKI. The need for dialysis was significantly lower in both the low dose ANP treatment and prevention studies as well as for patients undergoing major surgery. The length of time spend in hospital and ICU was shorter for patients receiving low dose ANP. High dose ANP was associated with more hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with established AKI. ANP may be associated with improved outcomes when used in low doses for preventing AKI and in managing postsurgery AKI. There were no significant adverse events in the prevention studies, however in the high dose ANP treatment studies there were significant increases in hypotension and arrhythmias.
