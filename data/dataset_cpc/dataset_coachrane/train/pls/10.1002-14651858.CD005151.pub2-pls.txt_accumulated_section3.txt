Nitrates for acute heart failure syndromes
Heart failure occurs when the lower muscular heart chamber is unable to fill or eject blood normally due to heart disease of any origin. Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are defined as gradual or rapid (over a period of less than 48 hours) deterioration in heart failure signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy. There are many types of drugs and non‚Äêdrug based interventions used for the treatment of AHFS. The aim of this review has been to determine the effectiveness and safety of nitrates (one drug group used for the treatment of AHFS) compared with alternative interventions in the treatment of patients with AHFS. 
The four studies in this review included 634 patients with AHFS and employed two types of nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin). The studies compared nitrates with frusemide and morphine, frusemide alone, hydralazine, prenalterol, intravenous nesiritide and placebo. The study population in the trials was predominantly male (469/634 or 74% of all the patients included in the studies were male). The findings of this review indicate that there is no significant difference between nitrates and alternative treatment interventions for patients with AHFS in terms of healthcare outcomes. Nitrates appeared to be well tolerated in all four studies. Headaches is the most common side effect reported by patients. Headaches occurred more frequently when compared with nesiritide. There appeared to be no significant difference in the occurrence of symptomatic hypotension, pain, nausea and angina between patients administered nitroglycerin and nesiritide. The included studies did not report healthcare costs as an outcome measure.
