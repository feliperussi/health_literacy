Strategies that might help to encourage people to continue to participate in a randomised trial (a type of scientific study) 
Why is this review important? 
Randomised trials are a type of scientific study typically used to test new healthcare treatments. In a randomised trial, people who agree to take part are randomly (by chance) put into one of two or more treatment groups and then studied for a period of time. The research team try to keep in touch with them to collect information about how they are doing. This 'follow up' can last from days to years depending on the trial, but the longer the trial lasts, the more difficult it can be. This might be because people are too busy to reply, are unable to come to a clinic, or just do not want to participate any longer. Keeping people in a trial is called 'retention'. If retention is poor, it can make the trial results less certain but most trials do not get data from all the people who started out in the trial. 
The information gathered during follow‐up, sometimes called data, helps the trial team to determine which of the treatments being tested works the best. Often this information is collected directly from patients by asking them to complete a questionnaire or by asking them to come back for a clinic visit. 
There are many ways to collect data from people in trials. These include using letters, the internet, telephone calls, text messaging, face‐to‐face meetings or the return of medical test kits. Research teams use different methods to try to collect data and it's important to know which strategies are effective and worthwhile, which is why we did this review to compare the success of different strategies.
