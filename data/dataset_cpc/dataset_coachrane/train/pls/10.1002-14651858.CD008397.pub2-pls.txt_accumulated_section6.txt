Interventions for replacing missing teeth: increasing bone thickness at the base of the natural sinus cavity above the upper jaw (maxillary sinus) to augment the maxillary sinus to enable implants 
Review question 
This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to determine whether and when it is necessary to increase the thickness of the bone layer at the base of the natural sinus cavity (maxillary sinus) that lies above the upper jaw in order to successfully insert dental implants onto which artificial teeth will be anchored. Also, to find the most effective techniques for doing this. 
Background 
Missing teeth may cause problems with eating and speaking, and affect how someone looks. Traditionally they have been replaced by loose false teeth (dentures) or bridges fixed between other teeth. Dental implants offer an alternative way of replacing teeth. Implants look like screws; they are made from materials such as titanium, which can fuse with the bone they are placed in (osseointegration) offering a stable base for artificial teeth to be fixed to. However, there needs to be enough depth of bone to successfully insert the implants. Bone thickness towards the back of the upper jaw can sometimes be too thin because of the natural sinus cavity (maxillary sinus) that lies above it. The cavity can also sometimes become larger following tooth loss. 
Where the bone is too thin, there are a number of techniques that are used to create a thicker layer of bone at the base of the sinus cavity which are generally known as 'sinus lift' procedures. These methods involve using either bone taken from the patient (autogenous bone) or other materials known as biomaterials, a combination of the two, or sometimes simply using a blood clot as a base for the body to naturally form additional bone.
