Dental cavity liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings placed into permanent teeth in the back of the mouth 
Review question 
This review was conducted to assess the effects of using liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings in cavities on the biting surface (Class I) and the biting surface and side(s) (Class II) of permanent teeth in the back of the mouth in children and adults. 
Background 
Tooth decay is the most common disease affecting children and adults worldwide. If left untreated, acid produced by bacteria in the dental plaque or biofilm forms cavities or holes in the teeth. A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of these materials is tooth‐colored, resin‐based composite or RBC. This material is increasingly used as an alternative to amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). 
Since the 19th century liners have often been placed in cavities in the teeth under the filling material. The liners are thought to protect the living pulp of the tooth from filling materials themselves and also from their potential to allow more heat or cold through than the natural tooth would. Although RBC filling materials are thought to be similar to the natural material of teeth in terms of how they conduct heat, sensitivity to temperature change is sometimes still an issue for people after treatment. 
Study characteristics
