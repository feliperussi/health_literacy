Treatments for improving outcomes for mother and baby when the waters have broken too early 
What is the issue? 
Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) is when the waters break at less than 37 weeks' gestation. It occurs in one in 50 pregnancies and can happen spontaneously or after a medical procedure has been performed, for example, tests where a needle is placed in to the womb to get a sample of fluid or tissue, or after an operation has been performed on the baby inside the womb. 
Why is this important? 
Breaking of the waters early in pregnancy can lead to significant problems including the baby being born too soon to survive, having immature lungs, and serious infections. Preterm babies are overall more likely to be ill and to suffer from long‐term disabilities, if they do survive. The survival of babies affected by PPROM is related to how early it occurs in the pregnancy and if an infection occurs. In some circumstances, the waters may reseal themselves. This is more likely to occur when no infection is present. 
Several treatments to reseal the membranes have been tried, with varying success. Resealing has been attempted by: 
a) injecting clotting factors and other medicines in to the hole in the womb to create a patch over the area that is leaking; 
b) taking tablets that may stimulate the body’s immune system to mend the area where the seal has broken; 
c) placing a sponge over the hole in the waters;
d) placing a seal over the neck of the womb to stop fluid leaking out and prevent infection. 
Our study is important because finding a successful treatment for PPROM may reduce the potential complications that may happen to the mother and baby such as preterm birth (being born before 37 weeks' gestation) and infections.
