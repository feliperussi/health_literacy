Hormonal and intrauterine methods for birth control in women age 25 years or younger
Background 
Women aged 25 years and younger are more likely to stop using birth control than women over 25 years of age. They are also more likely to get pregnant while using birth control compared with older women. We do not know which birth control methods have the lowest pregnancy rates and the highest continued use in young women. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized trials of birth control methods until August 2015. Randomized trials are clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. Women in these studies were 25 years old or younger. The birth control methods could be either hormonal or a non‐hormonal device placed in the uterus. The hormonal methods included pills, vaginal rings, or implants. The methods that are placed in the uterus include the intrauterine device (IUD) without hormones and the intrauterine system that has the hormone levonorgestrel (LNG‐IUS). IUDs and the LNG‐IUS are sometimes called intrauterine contraception (IUC). 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
We found five trials that enrolled had a total of 1503 women. Some studies looked at different types of IUC, while others compared pills versus a vaginal ring, skin patch, or IUC. No study showed any major difference between the groups in pregnancy or continued use. Some of the trials were too small to find a difference. Women kept using IUC at least as long as pills in one study. IUC may be useful for women in this age group. Studies of different birth control with more women would help determine which methods work the best for young women. Overall, the quality of the results was moderate to low.
