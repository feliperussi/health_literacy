Cuffed versus uncuffed tubes in children aged eight years and under, having general anaesthetic 
Review question 
Most surgical procedures may require general anaesthesia (a medically‚Äêinduced state of unconsciousness in which a person feels nothing). Tracheal tubes (a device that is inserted into the windpipe to maintain a person's airway) play a vital role in the surgery. A mechanical ventilator is often needed to keep the patient breathing during anaesthesia. This is a machine that helps a person to breathe in oxygen and to breathe out carbon dioxide. There are two types of tracheal tubes: one is cuffed, with a balloon at the end of the tube providing proper tracheal sealing and preventing the stomach contents from getting into the lungs. The other is uncuffed, with no balloon. This review focuses on the different effects of cuffed and uncuffed tubes on children of up to eight years old during general anaesthesia. 
Background 
Children have a smaller and more fragile airway than adults. Their larynx is funnel shaped with the narrowest portion occurring at the cricoid cartilage.There is a belief that the risks of windpipe and voice box injuries in children are higher with the use of cuffed tubes, although this assumption is not based on current evidence. 
The disadvantages of using an uncuffed tube are an increase in air leakage around the tube, making it difficult to ensure that the child is breathing adequate amounts of oxygen. In addition, the measurement of tidal volume (the normal volume of air displaced between breathing in and out, whether or not by mechanical ventilation) is compromised. It seems reasonable to suppose that cuffed tubes would be more likely to fit the trachea at the first attempt, whereas uncuffed tubes may require more attempts.
