Homocysteine lowering interventions for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and bypass grafts 
Homocysteine is one of the amino acids, the building blocks for proteins. High levels of homocysteine in the blood are associated with narrowing or blocking of arteries (atherosclerosis). However, it is not clear that the homocysteine itself causes the problem. Blood levels of homocysteine can be normalised by taking folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6, or betaine. 
People with PAD have poor blood flow in their legs caused by atherosclerosis narrowing or blocking their arteries. Symptoms include a limited ability to exercise or walk without developing cramping pains in the legs. Although such people can be treated surgically (such as by a bypass graft) or radiologically (by balloon angioplasty), there is an appreciable risk of failure of the treatment within 12 months, mainly because the arteries narrow and close up again (restenosis). High levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) may contribute to this restenosis and lowering homocysteine levels may help. 
We looked at studies where treatments to lower homocysteine were used in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Two trials with 161 participants with PAD were included in this review. One trial showed a significant  improvement in the ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants treated daily with 400 μg folic acid or 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF). A second trial showed that there was no difference in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement compared with placebo. None of the other predefined primary outcomes (mortality and rate of limb loss) were assessed in these studies. More research about the effect of homocysteine lowering therapy on the clinical progression of disease in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia is needed.
