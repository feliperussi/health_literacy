Personally tailored activities for people with dementia living in their own homes
Background 
People with dementia living in their own homes often have too little to do. If a person with dementia has the chance to take part in activities which match his or her personal interests and preferences, this may lead to a better quality of life, reduce challenging behaviour such as restlessness or aggression, and have other positive effects. 
Purpose of this review 
We investigated the effects of offering people with dementia who were living in their own homes activities tailored to their personal interests. 
Studies included in the review 
In September 2019 we searched for trials in which people with dementia living in their own homes were offered activities based on their individual interests, or family caregivers were offered such activities (an intervention group) compared with other people with dementia living in their own homes who were not offered these activities or whose family caregivers were not trained in delivering such activities (a control group). 
We found five studies including 262 people with dementia living in their own homes. The mean age of the study participants ranged from 71 to 83 years. All studies were randomised controlled trials, that is participants were assigned at random to either the intervention or control group. In one study the participants in the study groups switched after a specific time to the other group (i.e. the activity programme was offered to the participants in the control group, and the participants of the intervention group did not receive the activity programme any more). The participants had mild to moderate dementia, and the studies lasted from two weeks to four months.
