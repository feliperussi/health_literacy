Psychological interventions for diabetes‐related distress in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Review question 
To investigate the effects of psychological interventions on diabetes‐related distress in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Background 
Diabetes‐related distress has to do with the emotional experiences of people with diabetes mellitus, namely their concerns about disease management, support, emotional burden and access to health care. About half of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience this distress, which is associated with poor diabetes self‐care and disease control. Many psychological interventions have tried to reduce diabetes‐related distress, but it is uncertain which interventions are effective. 
Study characteristics 
We found 30 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 9177 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 week to 12 months and follow‐up after treatment from 0 to 12 months. Most studies took place in community settings, almost all in high‐income countries and two each in Asia and Latin America. The studies included a wide spectrum of interventions and were both individual‐ and group‐based. 
Key results 
Psychological interventions have a small and positive effect on confidence for self‐care and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ‐ a long‐term measure of glucose control) in adults with type 2 diabetes. Compared to usual care, psychological interventions showed no firm effect on diabetes‐related distress, health‐related quality of life, death from any cause, adverse events or blood pressure levels. No study reported on diabetes‐related complications (like stroke, heart attacks or kidney impairment) or socioeconomic effects (such as absence from work or costs for medication).
