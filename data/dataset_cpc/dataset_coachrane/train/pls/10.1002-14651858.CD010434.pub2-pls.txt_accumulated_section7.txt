Patient‐controlled intravenous pain relief compared to pain relief into the epidural space following abdominal surgery in adults 
Review question 
This review examined pain relief after abdominal surgery. We compared the self administration of pain‐relieving drugs such as morphine using a machine connected to an intravenous drip (IVPCA) versus pain relief administered into the tissue around the spine cord within the spinal canal (epidural) using either self administration with a programmable pump (PCEA) or a pre‐programmed continuous pump (CEA). The epidurals used morphine‐like drugs or local anaesthetics, or both. We assessed how effective these methods were at reducing pain and the likelihood of unwanted effects. 
Background 
Adequate pain relief is essential for good postoperative recovery and improves the ability to take deep breaths and get out of bed soon after surgery. Patients with poorly controlled pain are at increased risk of serious complications such as chest infections and blood clots to the lungs. At the same time, pain relief can produce side effects and complications. Two of the most common and most effective pain relief alternatives are opioids (such as morphine) injected into an intravenous drip each time the patient presses a button (IVPCA) and epidural pain relief, in which medications are administered to the epidural space around the spinal cord. Previous systematic reviews have suggested that the epidural technique might provide better pain relief than IVPCA. 
Search date 
We thoroughly searched the major electronic databases and trial registries for randomized trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) comparing IVPCA with epidural techniques. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies for further eligible trials. The evidence is current to September 2017.
