Acupuncture or acupressure for relieving pain during labour
We examined the evidence from randomised controlled trials on the use of acupuncture or acupressure in helping women to manage pain during labour. This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
What is the issue? 
The pain women experience during labour can be intense, with body tension, anxiety and fear making it worse. Pain is caused by contractions of the uterus, the opening of the cervix and, in the late first and second stages, by stretching of the vagina and pelvic floor as the baby moves down the birth canal. Effective, satisfactory pain management needs to be individualised for each woman. Women may also use strategies to try to break the fear‐tension‐pain cycle and work with the pain. Working with the pain involves offering women support and encouragement, finding comfortable positions, immersion in water and self‐help techniques. 
Many women would like to go through labour without using drugs. Women may turn to acupuncture or acupressure to help reduce their pain and improve management of the pain. 
Why is this important? 
Acupuncture has a long history of use in Asia, including China, Korea and Japan. Technical needling skills are needed to apply the needles at the correct points. Acupressure also has its origins in early China. To apply acupressure, the therapist uses their hands and fingers to activate the same points as in acupuncture. Sometimes only a few points are needed to alleviate pain or bring about a feeling of relaxation. Other times a combination of points may be required for greater effect. Some forms of acupressure are applied by trained health professionals, while others can be applied by the individual as a form of self‐massage.
