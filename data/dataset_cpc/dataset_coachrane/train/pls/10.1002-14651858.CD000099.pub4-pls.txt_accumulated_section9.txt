Growth hormone for in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
Review question 
Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about giving growth hormone as an additional treatment to women undergoing IVF compared to not giving this treatment to such women. 
Background 
During an IVF cycle, women need to be given gonadotrophin therapy to stimulate ovaries to produce eggs. Theoretically, the use of growth hormone as an added treatment may enhance the response of gonadotrophin therapy. We assessed the benefits and risks of using growth hormone compared with no growth hormone treatment in women undergoing IVF. 'Poor responders' in IVF treatment are usually older women with low ovarian reserve or women who had previous IVF treatment with less than five eggs collected despite a maximum dose of stimulation medication. Younger women with good ovarian reserve and good ovarian response (> 5 eggs collected) after ovarian stimulation are considered normal responders. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised controlled trials with 1352 women. This type of trial randomly assigns people into two groups. In this case, one group received IVF plus growth hormone and the other group received IVF only. The evidence is current to 11 November 2020. 
Key results 
In normal responders, with adjuvant GH use, the effect on live birth rate is very uncertain; if the chance of live birth without growth hormone is assumed to be 15%, the chance of live birth with growth hormone would be between 6% and 43%. There was not enough evidence to reach a conclusion regarding clinical pregnancy rates, number of women with at least one egg retrieved, embryo transfer achieved, and number of eggs retrieved in normal responders. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on mean units of gonadotropin used in normal responders.
