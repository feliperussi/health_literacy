Financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries
What is the aim of this overview? 
The aim of this Cochrane Overview is to provide a broad summary of what is known about the effects of financial arrangements for health systems in low‐income countries. 
This overview is based on 15 systematic reviews. Each of these systematic reviews searched for studies that evaluated different types of financial arrangements within the scope of the review question. The reviews included a total of 276 studies. 
This overview is one of a series of four Cochrane Overviews that evaluate different health system arrangements. 
Main results 
What are the effects of different ways of collecting funds to pay for health services?  Two reviews looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. 
‐ The effects of changes in user fees on utilisation and equity are uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). 
‐ It is uncertain whether aid delivered under Paris Principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results, and mutual accountability) improves health compared to aid delivered without conforming to those principles (very low‐certainty evidence). 
What are the effects of different types of insurance schemes?  One systematic review looked for studies that addressed this question and found the following. 
‐ Community‐based health insurance may increase people's use of services (low‐certainty evidence), but the effects on people's health are uncertain. It is uncertain whether social health insurance increases people's use of services (very low‐certainty evidence).
