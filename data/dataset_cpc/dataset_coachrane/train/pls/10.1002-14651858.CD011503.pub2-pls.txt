Valacyclovir compared with acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in people with an otherwise normal immune system 
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if valacyclovir performs better than acyclovir in the treatment of a painful itchy rash caused by the chickenpox virus (herpes zoster ophthalmicus). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found one study. 
Key messages  There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of valacyclovir compared with acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. 
What was studied in the review?  Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a painful itchy rash that appears on one side of the forehead. If the rash reaches the eye it may lead to visual impairment. This is because the infection can damage the front of the eye. Herpes zoster is caused by the chickenpox virus, which can remain in the body for many years after the original chickenpox infection, and may get reactivated. Doctors can treat herpes zoster ophthalmicus with acyclovir. This is an antiviral medication that kills the chickenpox virus. Valacyclovir is a modified version of acyclovir that may need to be taken less frequently as it is better absorbed by the body. 
What are the main results of the review?  The review authors found one relevant study from France. This study compared valacyclovir 1000 mg taken three times a day for seven days with acyclovir 800 mg taken five times a day for seven days. The company that makes valacyclovir (Glaxo) funded the study. 
The review authors are uncertain whether valacyclovir has any benefit over acyclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. They judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low because the study was small and there were some problems with the way it was reported. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to June 2016.
