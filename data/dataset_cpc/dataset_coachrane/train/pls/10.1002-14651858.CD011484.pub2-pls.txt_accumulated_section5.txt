Does pre‐transfusion washing of red blood cells for preterm babies improve their health outcomes? 
Background: Babies born preterm or with a low birth weight may be given blood transfusions for a number of reasons. For example, they are sometimes unable to make their own blood well yet; they may need several blood tests to monitor their condition; or they may need extra blood if they become critically unwell. 
Studies in older children and in adults have found that a process of ‘washing’ blood cells before transfusion improved short‐ and longer‐term outcomes. Washing blood removes almost all plasma proteins and most white blood cells, which may help reduce the side effects of a blood transfusion. We wanted to learn if preterm babies might experience these same positive effects. 
Review question: We wanted to learn whether washing blood cells before transfusion reduces the chance of illnesses that tend to occur in preterm babies. Some of the outcomes that we looked at were illnesses affecting eyes (retinopathy of prematurity), lungs (chronic lung disease), brain (intraventricular haemorrhages or cysts), and long‐term developmental problems. We also wanted to look at other outcomes like length of hospital stay and acute transfusion reactions. 
Key results: This review found only one study that evaluated the effects of washing blood cells before transfusion in preterm babies. This study included small numbers of babies. The outcomes the study reported that were relevant to our review were mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of initial hospitalisation. The results for all these outcomes were very uncertain. Washing blood cells might be helpful or harmful, but we cannot make a determination.
