Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing cognitive deterioration in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether people aged 40 years or older could maintain their mental abilities or reduce their risk of dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. 
Background 
There is great interest in anything people might do to keep themselves mentally healthy as they age and, especially, to reduce their risk of developing dementia. Various vitamin and mineral supplements have been suggested as ways to do this. Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the body and the ways they might affect brain health are not well understood. Therefore, we were interested in the effects of any vitamins or minerals, either alone or in combination. 
What we did 
We searched up to January 2018 for all trials which had studied the effect on cognition (thinking and remembering) of any vitamin or mineral supplements in people aged 40 years or more who had no cognitive problems at the beginning of the study. The studies had to include a comparison group which had not taken the supplement being studied and, to be sure the comparison was fair, it should have been decided at random whether people got the supplement or not. 
What we found 
We grouped the 28 included trials according to the kind of supplement they used and how it might work. 
Most of the trials were not originally designed to study cognition or dementia and used only simple measures of cognition. Very few studies investigated whether participants developed dementia. Long‐term studies are probably needed to find effects on the risk of dementia or cognitive decline but only 10 studies had an average length of follow‐up longer than five years. The studies were generally well‐conducted although the longer trials had difficulty following up all of the participants and this could have biased some of the longer‐term results.
