Women’s position for giving birth without epidural anaesthesia
What is the issue? 
Women often give birth in upright positions like kneeling, standing or squatting. Some women give birth on their backs in what are known as ‘supine’ positions ‐ including dorsal (the woman flat on her back), lateral (the woman lying on her side), semi‐recumbent (where the woman is angled partly upright) or lithotomy (where the woman’s legs are held up in stirrups). Birth position can be influenced by many different factors including setting, mother's choice, caregiver preference, or medical intervention. This Cochrane review assessed the possible benefits and risks to the mother and baby, by giving birth in upright positions compared with supine positions and also looked at some individual upright positions for benefits and harms. 
Why is this important? 
Giving birth in the supine position may have been adopted to make it more convenient for midwives and obstetricians to assist the labour and birth. However, many women report that giving birth on their backs feels painful, uncomfortable and difficult. It is suggested that women in upright positions give birth more easily because the pelvis is able to expand as the baby moves down; gravity may also be helpful and the baby may benefit because the weight of the uterus will not be pressing down on the mother’s major blood vessels which supply oxygen and nutrition to the baby. 
We looked at the upright positions such as: sitting (on an obstetric chair or stool); kneeling (either on all fours or kneeling up) and squatting (unaided or using a birth cushion or a squatting bar). We compared these with supine positions such as: dorsal; lateral; semi‐recumbent and lithotomy. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness, benefits and possible disadvantages of the different positions for women without epidural, during the second stage of labour.
