Antibiotics for injuries to the abdomen that break through the skin: which antibiotics are effective, and for how long should they be taken? 
Review Question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the use of antibiotics to prevent infections or death in people undergoing an operation for penetrating abdominal injuries. 
Background 
Penetrating abdominal trauma (gunshot or stab wounds to the abdomen) are a major cause of admission to hospital and often require an operation. If a person survives the initial injury, they may subsequently develop infections, which can lead to death. Before antibiotics were available, the majority of people with these injuries died from infections. 
Study Characteristics 
We searched for trials involving participants of any age or sex, who underwent an emergency operation to treat penetrating abdominal trauma. The evidence is current to 23 July 2019. We included 29 studies that included 4458 participants. There were problems with the design and conduct of all of these studies, which means that we were uncertain about the results. Most of these studies were carried out over 20 years ago, using antibiotics that are not often used today. Surgical techniques and practice have also evolved substantially during this time. Seven out of the 29 studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies, whilst the other studies did not state their funding sources. 
Key Results 
Because of the very low‚Äêquality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether giving longer courses of antibiotics after penetrating injury reduces the rate of infections after an operation. We are also uncertain if one antibiotic treatment is better than any other that was tested in the trials.
