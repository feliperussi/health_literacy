Thermotherapy (heat treatment) for treating osteoarthritis of the knee
To answer this topic, scientists found and analyzed three studies. Over 170 people with osteoarthritis continue to take their medications but used hot, cold or ice packs/towels with or without massage or no treatment. The studies were not of high quality but this Cochrane review provides the best evidence we have today. 
What is thermotherapy and how might it help osteoarthritis of the knee?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. Thermotherapy involves applying heat or cold to joints to improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis and can be done with packs, towels, wax, etc. Heat may work by improving circulation and relaxing muscles, while cold may numb the pain, decrease swelling, constrict blood vessels and block nerve impulses to the joint. Thermotherapy can be used in rehabilitation programmes or at home.   How well does thermotherapy work?  One study showed that massaging with ice for 20 minutes, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, improved muscle strength in the leg, the range of motion in the knee and decreased time to walk 50 feet compared to no treatment. 
Another study showed that ice packs for 3 days a week for three weeks improved pain just as well as no treatment. 
Another study showed that cold packs for 20 minutes for 10 periods decreased swelling more than no treatment. Hot packs for the same amount of time had the same effect on swelling as no treatment. 
How safe is it?  No side effects were reported in the studies, but in general, studies report that thermotherapy is safe when applied carefully.
