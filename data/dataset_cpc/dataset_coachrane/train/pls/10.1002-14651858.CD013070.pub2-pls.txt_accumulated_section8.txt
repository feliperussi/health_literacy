Stem cells for treating patients not responding to Crohn's disease treatment
Question 
Are stem cells (SCs) an effective and safe option in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) when they do not respond to their standard medical treatment?  
Key messages 
Stem cells when combined with standard medical treatment could be better than the medical treatment alone or with a placebo (a dummy treatment) in the healing of the opening in the perianal region connected to the bowels caused by CD (perianal fistula). 
Stem cells when combined with standard medical treatment could be safe when compared to the medical treatment alone or with a placebo in treating the bowel inflammation associated with Crohn's disease (total and serious adverse events). 
What are stem cells?  Stem cells are the cells responsible for forming new cells and renewing the surrounding tissue. They are also responsible for modifying the immune system. There are various types of SCs, self‐stem cells extracted from the patient's own body (autologous) and non‐self stem cells extracted from other individuals (allogeneic). They could be found in the bone marrow, fat tissue, placenta, umbilical vein, etc.  
What is Crohn's disease? It is an autoimmune (fighting the patient's own body) disease‐causing inflammation and stenosis of the bowel, or causing a bowel opening in the skin (fistula). CD usually follows an "on and off" pattern, it also affects the mortality, morbidity, and quality of life of the patients. Standard treatment of CD includes drugs that suppress the immunity of the patient including anti‐inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and biological drugs. However, one‐third of patients do not respond to medical or surgical treatment.
