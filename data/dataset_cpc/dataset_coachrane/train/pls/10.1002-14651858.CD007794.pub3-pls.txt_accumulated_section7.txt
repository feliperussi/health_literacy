Methods for the drainage of fluid containing cancer cells that collect in the abdomen in women with gynaecological cancer 
Background 
Malignant ascites is the build‐up of fluid within the abdominal cavity caused by underlying cancer. Women with advanced ovarian cancer and some women with advanced uterine cancer (also known as womb cancer) often need drainage for malignant ascites to alleviate discomfort. Guidelines to advise healthcare professionals involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally based on clinicians' experience. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to Novemeber 2019 that compared different ways of managing the drainage of fluid collected in the abdomen of women with gynaecological cancer (cancer that starts in a woman's reproductive organs). 
Key results and quality of evidence 
The original 2010 review found no relevant studies. This updated review included one randomised controlled trial (RCT: a type of study in which people are randomly assigned to receive different treatments) involving 245 women that compared drainage combined with catumaxomab (a medicine used to treatment malignant ascites) versus drainage alone. However, the results were insufficient to assess the difference between these treatments. Although women receiving drainage combined with catumaxomab had better quality of life (the general well‐being of a person) for longer compared to drainage alone, we are very unsure of this evidence due to the small number of participants and trials. There were some side effects in the drainage plus catumaxomab group (e.g. pain, low white blood cell count), but they were not well reported. At present, there is insufficient data regarding the best management of drainage for malignant ascites among women with gynaecological cancer.
