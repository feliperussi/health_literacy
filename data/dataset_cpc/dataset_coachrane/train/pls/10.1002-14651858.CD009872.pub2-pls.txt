Care for pregnant women who have experienced genital cutting
Female genital cutting (FGC) also known as female genital mutilation (FGM) or female circumcision is when some or all of a woman's or girl's external genital organs are cut or damaged for cultural beliefs, or reasons not connected with medical treatments. It is often performed by traditional practitioners such as traditional birth attendants without any form of anaesthesia or analgesia using non‐sterile instruments. There are no known medical benefits to FGC, and it can be dangerous for the health and psychological well‐being of these women and girls, resulting in both short‐ and long‐term problems. Long‐term complications include chronic pelvic infection, formation of cysts, vaginal obstruction and infertility. Some of the greatest health problems associated with FGC and faced by most women arise during pregnancy and when giving birth. In some cases, complications from FGC can result in death. 
Care offered to these women may include 1) surgery to widen the vaginal opening (deinfibulation), 2) cutting the perineum during birth to widen the outlet to help the baby to be born (episiotomy), 3) removal of cysts and 4) treatment of infections.  Women and their partners may also benefit from counselling to enable them to explore and understand the problems caused by FGC. This may also help them make informed decisions about the care they might receive. 
We looked for randomised controlled trials to find out what might work best for women. However, we did not find any studies for inclusion in this review. So, there remains the problem of how best to care for pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy in these circumstances. Trials are urgently needed, although conducting such studies might be difficult. In the meantime, caregivers will do their best to look after these women during pregnancy and childbirth.
