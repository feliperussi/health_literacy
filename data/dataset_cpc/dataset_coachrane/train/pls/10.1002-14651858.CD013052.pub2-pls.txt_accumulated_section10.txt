Benefits and risks of antibiotics taken orally or given as an injection to treat chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge) 
Why is this question important? 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent discharge – fluid that leaks out from a hole or tear in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
CSOM can be treated with antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections) taken orally or given as an injection (i.e. systemic treatment in which the whole body is treated). Systemic antibiotics can be used: 
‐ alone;‐ in combination with antibiotics in the form of drops, sprays, ointments or creams (topical, i.e. localised surface treatment); or‐ in combination with other treatments such as steroids (anti‐inflammation medicines) or antiseptics (substances that stop or slow down the growth of micro‐organisms). 
To find out how effective systemic antibiotics are for treating CSOM, and whether they lead to side effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that followed people with CSOM for at least one week and compared: 
‐ a systemic antibiotic used alone against a placebo (dummy) treatment, no treatment or another systemic antibiotic;‐ a systemic antibiotic combined with another treatment, against that treatment alone. 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies.
