Drains for leg artery surgery
Review question 
A surgical drain is a tube used to remove blood, pus or other fluid from a wound. We reviewed the evidence about whether inserting wound drains following leg artery surgery resulted in fewer complications compared with no drains. 
Background 
Patients who have severe blockages in the arteries of their legs often need to have the blockages treated. These blockages can be treated with surgery, and there are several different types of operation that can be used. Arterial bypass is an operation in which the blockage is bypassed by using a piece of vein or a synthetic tube so that the blood can go around the obstruction. An endarterectomy is an operation where the surgeon removes the fatty material that is causing the blockage, thereby improving the flow of blood. Sometimes after surgery on leg arteries, surgeons place drainage tubes in the wounds. It is thought that these drains may help to reduce infection, prevent the build‚Äêup of blood or other fluids in the wound, and avoid some other complications after operations. These benefits are not proven and nobody knows if drains are truly helpful. It is possible that drains could cause harm by allowing infection into a wound, by causing bleeding and by prolonging the time a patient spends in hospital. Nobody knows if surgeons should use drains in every wound all of the time, or only in cases where they think a drain is needed. 
Study characteristics 
In June 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving the use of drains after leg artery surgery. We identified three eligible trials involving 333 wounds in 222 patients, mainly aged over 65, who had leg artery surgery. Both men and women were included and all of the wounds were in the groin area as part of bypass and endarterectomy operations to improve blood flow.
