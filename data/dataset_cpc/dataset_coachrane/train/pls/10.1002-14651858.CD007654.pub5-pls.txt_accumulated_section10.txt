Do medicines for weight loss affect blood pressure, and reduce the effects of high blood pressure (hypertension)? 
What is high blood pressure (hypertension)? 
Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body. It is usually given as two figures: the pressure when your heart pushes blood out (systolic pressure), and the pressure when your heart rests between beats (diastolic pressure). Blood pressure is considered to be high when systolic pressure is over 140 and/or diastolic pressure is over 90, often written as '140 over 90' and measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). The risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older. 
Hypertension can increase people's risk of developing serious long‐term health problems, such as heart attack or stroke. Lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension reduces the number of people who develop diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), which leads to fewer deaths and cardiovascular problems.     
Weight and hypertension 
Hypertension treatment guidelines recommend keeping to a healthy weight and losing weight when needed. Some people may take medicines to help reduce their weight.         
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Medicines licensed for use in weight loss in the USA and Europe include orlistat and naltrexone combined with bupropion. Another combination, phentermine with topiramate, is licensed in the USA only. We wanted to find out if weight‐loss medicines have long‐lasting effects on blood pressure, and whether they could reduce the unwanted effects of high blood pressure on people's health.   
What did we do? 
We searched for studies about the effects of taking weight‐loss medicines in people with high blood pressure. We were interested in how these medicines affected blood pressure and body weight.  We also wanted to know how many people experienced any unwanted effects, how many people developed cardiovascular disease, and if any people died.
