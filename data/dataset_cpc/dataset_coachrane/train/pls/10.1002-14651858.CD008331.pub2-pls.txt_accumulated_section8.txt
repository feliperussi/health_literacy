Tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane Review presents what we know from research about the effect of tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA: 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include stomach problems, liver problems, anemia or infection. 
What is RA and what is tocilizumab? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Drugs such as tocilizumab also aim to help prevent permanent damage to your joints that can happen if RA is not treated.  
Tocilizumab is one of the biologic medicines for arthritis that stops the inflammation caused by a protein in the body called interleukin‐6. Biologics are a group of medications that suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation in the joints. Even though suppressing the immune system can make it slightly harder to fight off infections, it also helps to stabilize an overactive immune system. By reducing the inflammation, the aim is to help prevent damage to the joints. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with RA who have not improved with methotrexate alone, who take tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis:
