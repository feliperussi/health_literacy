What effects do washing and moisturising practices have on the skin health of older people in hospital and residential care settings? 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effects of different washing practices and emollients (moisturisers) when compared with usual care or no treatment on maintaining healthy skin in people aged 60 years or older in hospitals or care homes. 
Background 
With age, skin becomes drier; this may lead to discomfort, itching, and skin damage. Good hygiene and moisturising practice supports healthy skin ageing. However, research is limited, and current care is largely based on custom and practice. 
Study characteristics 
We included six studies (1598 participants), all completed in care homes. When reported, most participants were female and aged 80 years or older. 
Two studies included only people with diagnosed dry skin. Studies compared usual care or no treatment against differing cleansing and moisturising skin care regimens (a moisturising soap bar; combinations of water soak, oil soak, and lotion; regular application of a commercially available moisturiser; use of two different standardised skin care regimens comprising a body wash and leave‐on body lotion; bed bath with "wash gloves" containing numerous ingredients; and application of a hot towel after usual care bed bath). Length of treatment ranged from a single application for 10 seconds to six months of twice‐daily moisturiser use. Only one study assessed participants post treatment (one to eight days post treatment), and participants in the hot towel study were measured 15 minutes after their skin was wiped with a dry towel. When reported, four studies had received external funding, in two cases from commercial sponsors.
