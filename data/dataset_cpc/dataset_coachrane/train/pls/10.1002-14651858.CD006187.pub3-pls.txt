Very early versus delayed mobilisation after stroke
Review question Does very early and active mobilisation improve recovery after stroke compared with more delayed mobilisation? 
Background Care in a stroke unit is recommended for people soon after a stroke, and results in an improved chance of surviving, returning home, and regaining independence. Very early mobilisation (helping people to get up out of bed very early, and more often after the onset of stroke symptoms) is performed in some stroke units, and is recommended in many acute stroke clinical guidelines. However, the impact of very early mobilisation on recovery after stroke is not clear.

Study characteristics This review identified nine trials (2958 participants), although one trial (2104 participants) provided most of the information. On average, very early mobilisation participants started mobilisation 18.5 hours after their stroke, compared with 33.3 hours in the usual care group. In five trials, the very early mobilisation group were also known to have spent more time per day in therapy, or participated in a mobilisation activity. 
Main results Very early mobilisation did not increase the number of people who survived or made a good recovery after their stroke. There was a suggestion that very early mobilisation may reduce the length of stay in hospital by about one day. However, results from the single largest trial, and from an analysis of trials that started mobilising participants very early, raised the concern that starting intensive mobilisation within 24 hours of stroke may carry some increased risk, at least for some people with stroke. This potential risk needs to be clarified. 
Quality of the evidence Overall, the main results were supported by moderate‐quality evidence overall, but low‐quality evidence backed length of hospital stay and activities of daily living.
