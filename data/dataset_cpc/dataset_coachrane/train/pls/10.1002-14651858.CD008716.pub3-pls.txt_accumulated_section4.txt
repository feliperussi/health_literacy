Probiotics for people with hepatic encephalopathy
Why the review is importantHepatic encephalopathy is a disorder of brain function as a result of liver failure or portosystemic shunt or both. Both hepatic encephalopathy (clinically overt) and minimal hepatic encephalopathy (not clinically overt) significantly impair patient’s quality of life and daily functioning and represent a significant burden on healthcare resources. Probiotics are live micro‐organisms, which when administered in adequate amounts may confer a health benefit on the host. We searched and summarised randomised trials about the benefits and harms of any probiotic in any dosage, compared with placebo or no intervention, or with any other treatment for people with any grade of acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy. 
Main findingsThe evidence is current to June 2016. Of the 21 included trials including 1420 participants, 14 trials compared a probiotic with placebo or no treatment and seven trials compared a probiotic with lactulose. The treatment duration of the trials ranged from 10 days to 180 days. 
Compared with placebo or no intervention, probiotics probably improve recovery and may lead to improvements in the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy, quality of life, and plasma ammonia concentrations, but may lead to little or no difference in mortality. Probiotics may slightly improve quality of life when compared with no intervention; however, this conclusion is based on three trials with low‐quality evidence. Whether probiotics are better than lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy is uncertain because the quality of the available evidence was very low. There were no reports of septicaemia attributable to probiotic in any trial. There was no evidence of more adverse events with probiotics when compared to placebo or lactulose.
