Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for treating acute rejection episodes in kidney transplant recipients 
What is the issue?  Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end‐stage kidney disease. Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong the transplanted kidney's survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation. About 10% to 35% of all kidney transplant recipients will experience one episode of acute rejection in the first year. Options for treating these episodes include pulsed steroid therapy, the use of an antibody preparation, the alteration of background immunosuppression, or combinations of these options. 
What did we do?  This review investigated the role of mono‐ or polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of acute cellular or acute humoral rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Thirty one studies (1680 patients) were included. 
What did we find?  We identified 31 studies enrolling 1680 people. Any antibody was better than steroid treatment for reversing the first acute cellular rejection episode and preventing graft loss, but showed little or difference in reversing steroid‐resistant rejection episodes. Polyclonal antibody‐treated patients were more likely to experience an immediate reaction of fever, chills and malaise than those receiving steroid treatment. 
Conclusions  Antibody treatment was better than steroid treatment for reversing first acute cellular rejection and preventing graft loss but this treatment was associated with a high incidence of adverse effects. The main limitation of this review is that many of the included studies were performed during the cyclosporin/azathioprine era of kidney transplantation and therefore conclusions cannot necessarily be extrapolated to patients treated with more contemporary immunosuppressive regimens which include tacrolimus/mycophenolate or sirolimus.
