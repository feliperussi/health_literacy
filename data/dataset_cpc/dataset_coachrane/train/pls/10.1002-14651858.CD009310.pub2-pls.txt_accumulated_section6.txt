Myeloid growth factors for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
In this systematic review, we summarised and analysed the evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G‐CSF) and granulocyte‐macrophage colony stimulating factors (GM‐CSF) in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We searched several important medical databases and found seven randomised controlled trials fulfilling our pre‐defined criteria. We included trials which compared G‐CSF or GM‐CSF in addition to erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) stimulating agents (ESAs), chemotherapy or no supportive care, in newly diagnosed patients. 
Background 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of blood cancers which are characterised by the malproduction of one or more lineages of blood stem cells. MDS is described as a rare disease in people under the age of 50 years, but represents a common haematopoietic disorder (a disorder of blood and bone marrow, thus a defect in production and structure of blood cells) in patients older than 70 years. The presented symptoms are dependent on which cell lines are affected and include bleeding, general weakness and bacterial infections. 
Standard treatment in older and low‐risk patients is restricted to low‐dose chemotherapy and supportive care (blood transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors such as ESAs, stimulating red blood cells and G‐CSF and GM‐CSF, stimulating white blood cells). High‐risk patients are curatively treated with blood stem cell transplantation or palliatively with high‐dose chemotherapy, always combined with supportive care. 
Myeloid growth factors stimulate the production of certain cells. They are released by the human body by nature, but can also be pharmaceutically synthesised and are used for the improvement of blood counts and the avoidance of e.g. infections. The effect of growth factors is under discussion, since their impact on progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a more aggressive blood cancer, survival and infections is still unclear.
