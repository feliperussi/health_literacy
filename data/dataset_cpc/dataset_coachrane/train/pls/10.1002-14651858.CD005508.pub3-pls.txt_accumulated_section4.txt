Beta blockers for peripheral arterial disease
Intermittent claudication, the most common symptom of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease, results from decreased blood flow to the legs during exercise. Beta blockers, a large group of drugs, have been shown to decrease death among people with high blood pressure and coronary artery disease and are used to treat various disorders. They reduce heart activity but can also inhibit relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels, bronchi and the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. The non‐selective beta blockers propranolol, timolol and pindolol are effective at all beta‐adrenergic sites in the body, whereas other beta blockers, such as atenolol and metoprolol, are selective for the heart. 
Optimal therapy for people with coronary artery disease or hypertension and intermittent claudication is controversial because of the presumed peripheral blood flow consequences of beta blockers, which lead to worsening of symptoms. 
Currently, no evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that beta blockers adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication, and beta blockers should be used with caution, if clinically indicated. The review authors identified six randomised controlled trials that involved a total of only 119 people with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. The beta blockers studied were propranolol, pindolol, atenolol and metoprolol. None of the trials showed clear worsening effects of beta blockers on time to claudication, claudication distance and maximal walking distance as measured on a treadmill, nor on calf blood flow, calf vascular resistance and skin temperature, when compared with placebo. Trial investigators reported no adverse events or issues regarding taking the beta blockers studied.
