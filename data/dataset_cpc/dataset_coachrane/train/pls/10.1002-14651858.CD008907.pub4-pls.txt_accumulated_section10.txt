Eslicarbazepine acetate add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Review question 
This review is an update of a review first published 2011, and last updated in 2017.
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and side effects of eslicarbazepine acetate when used as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Background 
Eslicarbazepine acetate is an antiepileptic medicine that can be added (called an 'add‐on' treatment) to treat people who are taking other antiepileptic medicine but continue to have seizures (called drug‐resistant epilepsy). This review looked at how well eslicarbazepine acetate worked when used as an add‐on treatment and at some of the potential side effects of the medicine. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to September 2020. We included seven clinical trials with 2185 participants aged two to 77 years. The included studies had different treatment periods of 12 to 18 weeks. All seven trials were randomized controlled trials, which means that people were randomly divided into groups and compared. 
Key results 
This review found that eslicarbazepine acetate was effective when used in combination with other medicines to reduce the number of seizures in adults with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. Eslicarbazepine acetate may also be effective in reducing seizure frequency in children with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. People who took eslicarbazepine acetate were more likely to have no seizures compared to people who took a placebo (a pretend tablet), but they were more likely to stop taking eslicarbazepine acetate because of side effects. These included dizziness, nausea (feeling sick), somnolence (feeling sleepy), vomiting (being sick) and diplopia (having double vision).
