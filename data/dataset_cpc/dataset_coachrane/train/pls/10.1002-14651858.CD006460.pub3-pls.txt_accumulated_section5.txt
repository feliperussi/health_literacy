Treatment of amblyopia (lazy eye) with patching or drops/drug treatment
What is the aim of this review? In this systematic review, we aimed to summarize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of conventional occlusion (patching) and atropine penalization (drops) as treatments for amblyopia (lazy eye). 
Key messages We found evidence suggesting that conventional patching and atropine drops led to similar improvement in vision. 
What was studied in the review? Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a common childhood condition and is defined as poor vision in one or both eyes. Lazy eye is present with no clear problems with the visual pathway and is not immediately fixed by wearing glasses. Treatment for lazy eye usually starts with prescribing necessary glasses to correct any optical defects followed by promoting the use of the lazy (weaker) eye. This systematic review compared two treatments used to promote the use of the weaker eye: covering the stronger eye for a set number of hours per day, and atropine drops (atropine sulphate) to blur the eyesight of the better‚Äêseeing eye. 
What are the main results of the review? Our update of the previous version of this review included seven trials with a total of 1177 amblyopic eyes. Evidence from six trials (two of good methodological quality) suggests both patching and atropine drops produce visual acuity improvement in the short term (one to six months) and long term (24 months) in the weaker eye after starting treatment. We found no differences between the two treatments in straightening of the eyes, depth perception, or vision in the better eye. Both treatments were well tolerated. Atropine drops were taken more regularly than using the patch and associated with better quality of life, but blurry vision and sensitivity to light was more common in the atropine treated eyes. Skin, lid, or conjunctival irritation were more common among participants receiving patching than those receiving atropine.
