Comparison of propofol (an anaesthetic drug) with other drug options for sedating people undergoing painful procedures in emergency departments 
Background 
Propofol is a drug frequently used as a general anaesthetic to sedate (calm) people for surgery in the operating theatre. It is administered into a vein. There is increasing evidence that propofol can be used outside of the operating theatre to sedate people undergoing painful procedures (e.g. when relocating a joint that is out of its normal position because of an injury) in the emergency department (ED) setting. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the use of propofol to sedate people in the ED undergoing painful medical procedures. We wanted to discover the effectiveness and safety of propofol compared with other drugs used to sedate people in the ED. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence obtained is current to September 2013. We re‚Äêran the search in February 2015 and we will deal with the study awaiting classification when we update the review. We included 10 studies involving 813 participants. The included studies compared propofol with five other alternative drugs used to sedate people in the ED. We could not pool the results of the 10 studies because no two studies compared the same drug options. 
Key results 
We found very low quality evidence for the effects of propofol and the other drugs used for sedating people in the ED in terms of complications (side effects, including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. In one study comparing a drug combination of propofol and fentanyl (a painkiller) with midazolam and ketamine (a drug which acts as both a painkiller and a sedative), delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group.
