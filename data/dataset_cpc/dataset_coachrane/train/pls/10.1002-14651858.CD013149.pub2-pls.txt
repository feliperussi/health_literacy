PETTICOAT technique versus standard TEVAR for complicated type B aortic dissection
Background 
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body, delivering blood from the heart to the brain, organs and extremities. Aortic dissection is a separation of the aortic wall, caused by injuries that result in blood to flow into the vessel's wall. The ascending aorta starts at the top of the heart's left ventricle, If the ascending aorta is not involved in the aortic dissection, it is known as 'complicated type B'. People with complicated type B aortic dissection may present with aortic rupture or impending rupture, persistent hypertension despite full medication, symptoms of partial paralysis of the lower limbs (paraparesis), insufficient blood supply of organs (organ malperfusion) and chest or abdominal pain which is hard to control (refractory pain). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR; a minimally invasive procedure to repair the aorta) has become the first‐line choice for treating complicated type B aortic dissection. However, favourable outcomes of the repaired aorta are usually only seen in the area covered by the stent. The PETTICOAT technique extends the covered segment by using a bare metal stent to obtain a better outcome. It is unclear whether PETTICOAT is better than TEVAR. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We performed a comprehensive literature search on 5 November 2018 for all randomised controlled trials addressing this review question. We found no randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the quality of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Randomised controlled trials are needed to provide solid evidence on this topic. Evidence from non‐randomised studies with large sample sizes would also be helpful in guiding clinical practice.
