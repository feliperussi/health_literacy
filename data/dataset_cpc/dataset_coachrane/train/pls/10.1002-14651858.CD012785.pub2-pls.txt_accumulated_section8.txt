Prostacyclin in pulmonary arterial hypertension
Review question 
We wanted to review whether a group of drugs called prostacyclin analogues help people with pulmonary hypertension. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Why this review is important 
Pulmonary hypertension can cause breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance, reduced quality of life, hospitalisations, and early death. Prostacyclin analogues may improve blood circulation in the right heart and lungs. We wanted to make sure if these drugs are being used, there is evidence of benefit and little or no harm. 
Main findings 
We found and included 17 trials with 3765 people. Most of the studies were 12 weeks long. Some trials were as long as 52 weeks. Most trials involved adults. People who were given prostacyclin analogues were compared to people who were not given prostacyclin. People in four trials were given the drugs by a continuous drip (24 hours/day) into a vein (intravenous) and in one trial through continuous injection under the skin (subcutaneous). In five trials people inhaled the drugs through a nebuliser and in five trials they took tablets (oral). People in two studies took selexipag tablets. Selexipag is an agonist of the prostacyclin receptor and the trials in selexipag were analysed separately. 
People who were given prostacyclins via intravenous drip showed improved survival (a lower chance of dying). They could also walk on average 92 metres further in six minutes than people not given the prostacyclin drip. They were also more likely to improve their functional class (what you can and cannot do on a daily basis). People with intravenous prostacyclins had better heart function on average than those who had no treatment.
