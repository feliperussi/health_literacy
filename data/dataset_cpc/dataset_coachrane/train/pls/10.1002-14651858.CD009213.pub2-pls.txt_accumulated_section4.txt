How often should dressings on central venous access devices (CVADs) be changed to reduce catheter‐related infection? 
Background  A central venous access device (CVAD, also known as a central venous catheter) is a hollow tube that is placed in a large vein with the tip sitting near the heart. CVADs allow medications, fluids and blood products to be given straight into the bloodstream and allow blood samples to be taken for analysis. One of the negative consequences of a CVAD can be an infection of the blood stream which is called catheter‐related bloodstream infection or CRBSI which can be serious and even life‐threatening. Some CVADs can stay in place for weeks, months or years. Most patients admitted to an intensive care unit will have a CVAD inserted and patients with poor veins or requiring long‐term treatment will be offered a CVAD. Dressings are placed over the insertion site of the catheter where it enters the vein, usually in the chest, neck or arm, to protect the surrounding skin. Dressings help prevent infections from starting and they stop the CVAD from moving around. Dressings are changed when they become dirty or they start to fall off. Frequent dressing changes can cause damage to the surrounding skin, so patients may experience pain or skin damage when the dressing is removed. Changing the dressing frequently is also expensive. 
We wanted to see if there were any advantages or disadvantages to longer or shorter time intervals between CVAD dressing changes. Some hospitals or healthcare facilities recommend changing dressings every few days, while others keep dressings in place for longer. 
Review question  We reviewed the available evidence about the effect of different time intervals between dressing changes for CVADs and whether they had an effect on the risk of CRBSI and other complications. We found five studies that provided information for our review.
