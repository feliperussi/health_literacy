Is electrical stimulation effective for treating pressure ulcers?
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether electrical stimulation (ES; an electrical current applied to the skin) can help heal pressure ulcers. We collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question and found 20 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
ES compared with no ES probably increases the proportion of pressure ulcers healed and the rate of pressure ulcer healing (moderate certainty evidence) but its effect on time to complete healing and the surface area of pressure ulcers is uncertain (very low certainty evidence). The most commonly reported side effects of ES were reddening of the skin and discomfort. There is a need for better quality research to determine whether ES is safe and effective. 
What was studied in the review? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, bed sores or pressure injuries) are injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissue caused by sustained pressure over bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels or lower back. People with reduced mobility due to age, disability or illness are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
ES is provided by an electrical current that can be applied to the skin in different ways. ES requires the placing of at least two small electrodes on the skin connected to a small battery‚Äêpowered device which controls the intensity of the current. ES can be delivered either as a direct or pulsed current. It causes a tingling or vibratory sensation in most people except those who cannot feel due to conditions such as spinal cord injury. We reviewed the evidence about whether ES affects the number of pressure ulcers healed, the size and severity of the pressure ulcers, the time to complete healing, and quality of life. We also wanted to find out about any side effects associated with ES.
