Surgery for hip impingement (femoroacetabular impingement)
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effectiveness and safety of surgery for hip impingement (also called femoroacetabular impingement). A search for relevant studies was done on 19th November 2013. The review of the results from this search showed the following. 
1. No research studies have been completed that are of sufficient quality to accurately determine the benefit and safety of surgery for femoroacetabular impingement. 
2. Four ongoing research studies may help to determine the benefit and safety of femoroacetabular impingement surgery when they are completed. 
All of the ongoing research studies are recruiting adult patients with femoroacetabular impingement. Three of these studies are comparing hip arthroscopy versus non‚Äêoperative care. The fourth study is comparing hip arthroscopy versus a sham arthroscopic hip procedure. 
What is femoroacetabular impingement and what is surgery?  Femoroacetabular impingement, or hip impingement, occurs because of subtle abnormalities of hip shape. The abnormalities of hip shape can cause damage to soft tissues around the hip including the cartilage (on the surfaces of the joint), which allows the joint to move freely. Femoroacetabular impingement can cause pain and restrict hip function. Surgery for femoroacetabular impingement can be either arthroscopic (keyhole) or open surgery. The aim of surgery is to correct the hip shape abnormalities and to repair damaged soft tissues and cartilage. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with femoroacetabular impingement who have surgery 
Until any high quality research studies are available for review it is not possible to provide any estimate of whether surgery helps people with femoroacetabular impingement or not.
