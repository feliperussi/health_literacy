Ephedrine treatment for myasthenia gravis, neonatal myasthenia and congenital myasthenic syndromes 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of ephedrine in adults and children with myasthenia gravis (MG), neonatal myasthenia and the congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs). 
Background 
Myasthenia is a group of rare conditions in which muscle fatigue and weakness are the main symptoms. These symptoms occur because signals do not pass from the nerve to the muscle properly. In autoimmune MG and neonatal myasthenia, the person’s own immune system attacks the proteins that carry these signals. In CMS, there are inborn defects in these proteins. Most people with myasthenia respond well to standard drug and supportive treatments. Ephedrine could have a role when initial treatment is not successful. Ephedrine is a stimulating drug, although exactly how it works is unknown. As far as we know, the use of ephedrine has never been properly assessed in people with myasthenia. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Randomised studies provide the best quality evidence. We did not find any randomised studies of ephedrine in neonatal myasthenia, autoimmune MG, or the CMSs. Fifty‐three non‐randomised studies, which provide weaker evidence than randomised studies, have reported the effects of ephedrine on muscle weakness, fatigue, and quality of life. We have described these findings narratively in the Discussion section of the review. Effects may differ depending on the type of myasthenia. Adverse effects that were reported in these studies included palpitations, sleep disturbances, nervousness, and irritability when ephedrine was stopped. We conclude that there is a need for high‐quality studies to assess the effects of ephedrine in MG, neonatal myasthenia, and the CMSs. 
The evidence is current to November 2014.
