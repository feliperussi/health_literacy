Do PARP inhibitors improve survival in women with ovarian cancer, and what are the side effects? 
Key messages  
Compared to an inactive 'dummy' medication (placebo), PARP (poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase) inhibitors (PARPi) given as daily tablet treatment after chemotherapy (maintenance treatment): 
‐ may have little to no effect on the amount of time someone with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) will live overall (although this outcome may change as more data become available); 
‐ probably delay disease progression in women with newly‐diagnosed EOC;
‐ probably delay disease progression in women with recurrent platinum‐sensitive EOC;
‐ probably cause an increase in the risk of severe side effects.
We are very uncertain about whether a delay in disease progression has a beneficial effect on quality of life, as data are inconsistently reported, but the limited data suggest that PARPi may improve symptoms  by delaying disease progression. 
What is epithelial ovarian cancer?  
EOC is a cancer that arises from the lining (epithelium) of the ovaries, fallopian tube and the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). Because cells have immediate access to the abdominal cavity, EOC often presents at a late stage. Initial treatment is with a combination of surgery, ideally to remove all visible disease, and chemotherapy. Disease will recur in most people and further treatment is required. Scientists have therefore been looking at new ways to stop cancer cells growing. 
What are PARP inhibitors?  
Being able to repair DNA is vital to cell survival. Normal cells have more than one DNA repair pathway. However, cancer cells often have defects in DNA repair pathways. The BRCA gene is involved in DNA repair and is commonly damaged (mutated) in people with EOC. Blocking another DNA repair pathway with a PARPi stops cancer cells from repairing DNA, causing cells to die. PARPi therefore differ from conventional chemotherapy, and are likely to work better in BRCA‐mutated cells.
