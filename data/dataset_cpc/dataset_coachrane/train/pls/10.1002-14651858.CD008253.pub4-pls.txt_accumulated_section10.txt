Steroids applied directly to polyps in the nose in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of applying steroids directly to polyps in the noses of people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
People with cystic fibrosis often have polyps in their nose which can cause discharge and also a blocked nose. We know that people with cystic fibrosis and polyps in their nose also have more of some types of bacteria in their lungs. This can lead to serious chest complications later on. If we treat the polyps effectively at an early stage, we may prevent these chest complications. 
Steroid sprays or drops are often applied directly to polyps in the nose.These drugs are usually a safe treatment but can have some important side effects, like affecting the immune system and how the body can regulate blood sugar. They also add to the existing burden of treatment, especially if they need to be taken for the rest of a person's life. However, these drugs have been shown to be successful in treating polyps in people who do not have cystic fibrosis.

Study characteristics 
Our search found one trial with 46 adult volunteers with cystic fibrosis which compared nasal drops containing a steroid (betamethasone) to identical drops containing no active treatment. Two drops were applied directly to polyps twice a day for six weeks. Volunteers were put into the different treatment groups at random and a total of 22 volunteers received the steroid drops and 24 received the dummy treatment.
