Exercise for people with haemophilia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the safety and usefulness of exercise for men with haemophilia. 
Background 
Haemophilia is a group of disorders in which one of the blood clotting proteins does not work properly. It mainly affects men, although women can also be affected. People with haemophilia bleed into their joints and muscles which can lead to painful chronic arthritis. 
Exercise is often used during recovery from a joint or muscle bleed and to maintain or improve a person's ability to function and participate in daily activities despite joint damage. 
We wanted to know if exercise was safe (that is, exercise does not cause additional bleeding) and whether exercise was able to improve muscle strength, joint mobility, pain, balance, gait, fitness, and overall functioning. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 14 December 2016.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies with 233 male participants with haemophilia A or B (of any severity), aged eight to 49 years. Length of study ranged from four to 12 weeks. 
Key results 
Several types of exercise programs were studied, including stretching, strengthening with weights, exercise in water, treadmill walking, and exercise bicycle. Some studies compared participants who did one type of exercise with those who did another type of exercise; other studies compared an exercise group with a control group that did no exercise. 
There were no data relating to our primary outcomes which indicated whether bleed frequency changed after an exercise program. There were no adverse effects measured or reported. Quality of life was not measured.
