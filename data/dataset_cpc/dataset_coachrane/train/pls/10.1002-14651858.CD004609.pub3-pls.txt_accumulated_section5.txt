Does hyperbaric oxygen therapy improve the survival and quality of life in patients with traumatic brain injury? 
Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of death and disability. Not all damage to the brain occurs at the moment of injury; a reduction of the blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain can occur afterwards and cause further secondary brain damage that is itself an important cause of avoidable death and disability. In the early stages after injury, it is therefore important that efforts are made to minimise secondary brain damage to provide the best chances of recovery. 
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proposed as a treatment for minimising secondary brain damage by improving the oxygen supply to the brain. Patients undergoing HBOT are placed inside a specially designed chamber in which 100% oxygen is delivered at a greater than normal atmospheric pressure. It is sometimes used as a treatment to increase the supply of oxygen to the injured brain in an attempt to reduce the area of brain that will die. 
The effectiveness of HBOT on the recovery of brain‐injured patients is uncertain. There is also concern regarding potential adverse effects of the therapy, including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short‐sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. 
In an attempt to address the uncertainty surrounding the use of HBOT, the authors of this review identified all studies which were randomied controlled trials investigating the effects of HBOT in traumatically brain‐injured people of all ages.
