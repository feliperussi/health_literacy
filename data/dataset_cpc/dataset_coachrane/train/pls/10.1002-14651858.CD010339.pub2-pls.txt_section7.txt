Given an average sensitivity of 83% for ERCP, we would expect that on average 83 out of 100 people (this may vary between 72 and 90 out of 100 people) with CBD stones would be detected while the remaining 17 people would be missed and would not receive appropriate treatment. Based on an average specificity of 99% for ERCP, we would expect that on average 99 out of 100 people without CBD stones would be identified as not having CBD stones; 1 out of 100 (this could vary between 0 and 17 out of 100 people) would be false positive and would not receive appropriate treatment. For IOC, an average sensitivity of 99% means that on average 99 out of 100 people (this may vary between 83 and 100 out of 100 people) with CBD stones would be detected while only one person would be missed and would not receive appropriate treatment. In terms of specificity, an average of 99% for IOC means that 99 out of 100 people without CBD stones would be identified as not having CBD stones with only one false positive (this could vary between 0 and 5 out of 100 people) who would not receive appropriate treatment. It appears that both tests are fairly accurate in guiding further invasive treatment as most people diagnosed with CBD stones by these tests have CBD stones. However, some people may have CBD stones in spite of having a negative ERCP or IOC test result. Such people may have to be re‚Äêtested if the clinical suspicion of CBD stones is very high because of their symptoms.
