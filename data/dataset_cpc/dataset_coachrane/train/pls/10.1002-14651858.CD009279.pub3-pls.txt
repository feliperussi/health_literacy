Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections during pregnancy
Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small‐for‐gestational‐age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non‐pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. 
This review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.
