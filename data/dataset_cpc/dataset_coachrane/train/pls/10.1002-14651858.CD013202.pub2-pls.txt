Stem cell‐based therapies following poor brain oxygenation at birth (hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy) in newborns 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives, or improve the long‐term development, of newborns who have poor brain oxygenation at birth ('hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy')? 
Background 
Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that the lack of oxygen has damaged. 
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We identified three potential studies, but we excluded them due to the way they were designed which meant that their results could not answer our review question (phase 1 studies). Fifteen studies are ongoing. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that were available up to June 2020.
