Preventing type 2 diabetes in adults with mental health conditions in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature to review the evidence on the effects of pharmacological (drug), behavioural (behaviour change) and organisational (delivery of health care) interventions for the prevention of type 2 diabetes among people with mental disorders in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Type 2 diabetes is a serious health condition that may develop when the body can no longer properly use a hormone called insulin. There are many reasons why a person may develop type 2 diabetes, including being overweight, having high blood pressure, not getting enough exercise, having a family history of the disease, and several other possible risk factors. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to our search date, 20 February 2020. 
Why is this important? 
People with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than the general population. Many people suffering from mental health conditions, who are at an increased risk of developing diabetes, live in LMICs. Treating diabetes in this population poses challenges to healthcare systems. Preventing the development of diabetes is therefore important to people with mental health conditions and to healthcare systems in LMICs. 
What did we find? 
Among adults with mental health conditions, we identified only one study that assessed our primary outcome, prevention of type 2 diabetes. This hospital‐based study with 150 participants (99 participants with schizophrenia) found low‐certainty evidence of no difference in risk between the use of older antipsychotic medications (typical antipsychotics) and newer antipsychotic medications (atypical antipsychotics) for the outcome of developing type 2 diabetes.
