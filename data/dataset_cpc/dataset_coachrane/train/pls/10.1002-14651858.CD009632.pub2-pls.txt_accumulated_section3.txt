Mammography followed by ultrasonography compared to mammography alone for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer 
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Evidence shows that mammography in healthy women 50 to 70 years of age can detect breast cancer early and reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer. Mammography, however, is not a perfect tool to detect breast cancer and misses some tumours in some women, particularly in women who have dense breasts. In women with dense breasts, the normal breast tissue and the tumour are difficult to distinguish from each other on the mammogram. Because of this, some supporters feel that the addition of ultrasonography screening of these women in addition to the mammography screening will detect those tumours that are missed by mammography alone. Others feel that this will increase the rate of false positive tumours and increase the number of biopsies and unnecessary treatment. 
The benefit of ultrasound as an additional examination for women who do not have especially dense breasts and who have normal mammographies is uncertain. This review sought to examine the evidence for and against adding ultrasonography screening to mammograms for women at average risk for breast cancer. It is important to weigh positive and negative sides of screening because the detection of more tumours by screening does not necessarily mean that more women will have their lives saved. We need to assess whether the few additional cancers that may be detected by ultrasonography lead to a real decrease in mortality from breast cancer and then balance any benefit against the harm caused by many women being incorrectly alarmed or diagnosed.
