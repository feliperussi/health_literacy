The addition of chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment after surgery in carcinosarcoma of the womb 
Carcinosarcomas of the uterus (womb) are uncommon cancers accounting for 4.3% of all cancers of the womb. These rare cancers have poor prognosis; one of the reasons for the poor survival outcome is the fact that over a third of these cancers (carcinosarcomas) have already spread beyond the womb at the time of diagnosis. 
The main treatment is surgery to remove the cancer, however, because of the high rates of both local and distant recurrence after surgery, effective adjuvant therapies are needed. This review has shown that women with high stage disease (stage III‚ÄêIV persistent or recurrent disease) who received combination chemotherapy including ifosfamide had a lower risk of death and disease progression than women who received ifosfamide alone, after adjustment for performance status. 
In addition, radiotherapy to the abdomen was not associated with improved survival, as we found in one trial that there was no difference in the risk of death and disease progression in women who received whole abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy, after adjustment for age and stage of disease. Previous studies have shown that doxorubicin, despite being established in the treatment of uterine carcinoma, does not seem to be highly active. 
Adverse events were comprehensively reported for the comparisons of combination therapy and ifosfamide and whole body irradiation and chemotherapy. More women experienced side effects when they received combination therapy than ifosamide alone and chemotherapy than whole body irradiation. The effect of therapy on quality of life was not reported in any of the trials.
