We identified one study (593 participants) that compared tofacitinib versus a placebo (a fake medicine). The participants had moderate‐to‐severe ulcerative colitis that responded to tofacitinib or placebo induction therapy (10 mg twice daily for eight weeks). The study was of high methodological quality. High‐certainty evidence suggests that tofacitinib (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) is more effective than placebo at achieving clinical remission (stopping of symptoms) and endoscopic remission (i.e. healing of inflamed bowel mucosa) of ulcerative colitis at 52 weeks. The rates of side effects (tofacitinib: 76%; placebo: 75%) and serious side effects (tofacitinib: 5%; placebo: 7%) were similar in participants receiving tofacitinib and placebo. High‐certainty evidence suggests there is no increased risk of side effects with tofacitinib compared to placebo. Commonly reported side effects included worsening ulcerative colitis, nasopharyngitis (i.e. common cold), arthralgia (i.e. joint pain) and headache. The certainty of the evidence for serious side effects was low due to a low number of events. Serious side effects included non‐melanoma skin cancers, cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack), cancer other than non‐melanoma skin cancer, Bowen's disease (i.e. a type of skin cancer), skin papilloma (i.e. a tumour of the skin) and uterine leiomyoma (i.e. a tumour in the uterus). In addition, there was a higher rate of withdrawal from the study due to side effects in the placebo group compared to the treatment group. Nine per cent of participants taking tofacitinib withdrew due to a side effect compared to 19% of participants taking placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence). The most common reason for study withdrawal due to a side effect was worsening ulcerative colitis.
