Antithrombin III for critically ill patients
Background 
Antithrombin is a small particle produced by the liver. It deactivates several substances which affect the ability of the blood to form clots. Its activity is increased many‚Äêfold by the drug heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin to clotting factors so that the blood does not form clots. Antithrombin also reduces inflammation in the human body. Inflammation is the body's attempt at self protection to remove harmful stimuli and begin healing processes. Inflammation is thus not always a bad process. 
This updated review assessed the effects of antithrombin in people recovering from critical illness. Our primary goal was to investigate whether the number of people who died changed by giving antithrombin. We also investigated whether there were more complications among people treated with this drug, the extent of bleeding and the amount of blood given to the critical ill people. Finally we examined the impact of antithrombin on the duration of respiratory therapy, length of stay in the intensive care units and in the hospital in general. 
Study characteristics 
We included 30 trials with 3933 participants (3882 in our data calculation) in this updated review. We found the overall quality of trials to be poor, with little information on how the experiments were carried out. The results were limited and the included trials were mostly small. In most trials, there was a high risk of misleading information. Thus, the results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is up to date to 27 August 2015. 
Study funding sources 
Three of the 30 included trials reported receiving money from drug companies.
Key results 
In our review we could not identify a clear advantage of antithrombin for the objectives we examined, overall or among various types of patients or subgroups. In our investigation of bleeding events, however, we found an increased risk of bleeding for patients treated with antithrombin.
