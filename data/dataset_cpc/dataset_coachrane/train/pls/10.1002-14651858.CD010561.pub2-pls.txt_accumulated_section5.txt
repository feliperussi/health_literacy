Immune tolerance induction to destroy inhibitors in people with haemophilia A or B
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effect of immune tolerance induction to remove inhibitors in people with haemophilia A and B. 
Background 
Haemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders, where affected people are missing a clotting factor in their blood, which is needed for normal blood clotting. Without this factor, people with haemophilia cannot make proper clots, and they may bleed for a much longer time than normal after an injury, or may experience sudden and unexpected bleeding inside the body and into joints. These bleeding incidents can cause permanent damage to the affected area and can be life threatening. The current treatment for haemophilia is replacement therapy, where the missing clotting factor is injected into the blood. Sometimes, when the missing clotting factor is introduced, the person's immune system will think it is a foreign body, and try to eliminate it with molecules called inhibitors. When a person with haemophilia develops an inhibitor, the injected clotting factor is destroyed before it can stop the bleeding. This is a very serious problem that affects almost one in three people with haemophilia A and approximately one in 30 people with haemophilia B. Immune tolerance induction is a treatment to make the immune system get used to the clotting factor, so that it no longer rejects the factor. This treatment, which involves giving large doses of factor concentrate, is currently used at different doses. We are unsure of how the dosing options work and how safe they are. To discover this, we searched the evidence until July 2013.
