¹²³I‐MIBG‐ and 18F‐FDG‐PET‐imaging, two nuclear imaging methods for diagnosing neuroblastoma tumours 
Background and rationale 
Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumour that can be visualized by a specific nuclear imaging compound, called metaiodobenzylguanidine (¹²³I ‐MIBG). ¹²³I‐MIBG‐imaging is not only important for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, but also for localization of metastases (spread of the disease to other organs). Sometimes, the neuroblastoma does not take up ¹²³I‐MIBG and as a result the neuroblastoma is not visible on the scan. In that case, another type of nuclear imaging might be useful to visualize the neuroblastoma: fluoro‐deoxy‐glucose – positron emission tomography (18F‐FDG‐PET)‐imaging. 
In the literature the ability to discriminate between neuroblastoma and non‐neuroblastoma lesions for these two types of nuclear imaging methods vary. 
Prognosis, treatment and response to therapy of patients with neuroblastoma are currently based on scoring the amount of metastases per body segment visible on ¹²³I‐MIBG scans. Therefore, it is important to determine the exact ability to discriminate between neuroblastoma and non‐neuroblastoma on ¹²³I‐MIBG‐imaging and 18F‐FDG‐PET‐imaging. We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of ¹²³I‐MIBG‐imaging and 18F‐FDG‐PET‐imaging for the detection of a neuroblastoma in children suspected of this disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical studies comparing ¹²³I‐MIBG or 18F‐FDG‐PET imaging, or both, with microscopic examination of tissue suspected of neuroblastoma (histopathology). The evidence is current up to 11 September 2012. 
We identified 11 eligible studies including 621 children that fulfilled our inclusion criteria: children < 18 years old with a neuroblastoma and ¹²³I‐MIBG or 18F‐FDG‐PET imaging or both. 
All studies included proven neuroblastoma.
Quality of the evidence 
All 11 included studies had methodological limitations. Only one included study provided data on specificity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual as 'disease‐free') and therefore we could not perform all of the planned analyses. 
Key results 
When compared to histopathological results the sensitivity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual person as 'diseased') of ¹²³I‐MIBG imaging varied from 67% to 100% in patients with histologically proven neuroblastoma. This means that in 100 children with proven neuroblastoma ¹²³I‐MIBG imaging will correctly identify 67 to 100 of the neuroblastoma cases. Only one study, that reported on a lesion level, provided data to calculate the specificity (the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual as 'disease‐free'): 68% in 115 lesions. This means that of 100 disease‐free lesions in patients with proven neuroblastoma ¹²³I‐MIBG imaging will correctly identify 68 lesions. So, in about 10% of the cases the neuroblastoma is not visible on ¹²³I‐MIBG imaging (false negative results). For these cases, it is advisable to perform an additional test like 18F‐FDG‐PET imaging, but to be certain of its clinical value, more evidence is needed. 
Only one included study reported on false positive findings. This means that ¹²³I‐MIBG imaging and 18F‐FDG‐PET imaging incorrectly identified neuroblastoma lesions in patients which might result in wrongly classifying a patient with metastatic disease. It is important to keep in mind that false positive findings can occur, although more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made.
