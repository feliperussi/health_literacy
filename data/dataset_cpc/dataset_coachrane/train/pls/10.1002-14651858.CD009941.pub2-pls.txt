Femoral nerve blocks for acute postoperative pain after knee replacement surgery
Total knee replacement is a common and often painful orthopaedic operation. Femoral nerve block (FNB) is an analgesic technique that blocks sensation to the knee to reduce pain following surgery. FNB is given as a single injection or as continuous infusion of numbing medication in the groin area. 
This review compared FNB with other common analgesic techniques (patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids, epidural analgesia, local infiltration analgesia and oral analgesia). A total of 45 randomized trials with 2710 participants were included. Among the included studies, 30 treatment groups compared FNB with PCA opioids, 10 compared FNB with epidural analgesia, five compared FNB with local infiltration analgesia, one compared FNB with oral analgesia and four compared continuous FNB with single‐injection FNB. The average methodological quality of the included studies was moderate. 
FNB (any type) resulted in less pain at rest and on movement during the first 72 hours after surgery, compared with PCA opioid alone. FNB also resulted in lower opioid consumption, fewer patients with nausea and vomiting, greater knee flexion and higher patient satisfaction, compared with PCA opioid. Additionally, continuous FNB provided better pain relief than was attained with single‐injection FNB. 
No differences in postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours were noted between FNB and epidural analgesia, although the former resulted in fewer patients with nausea and vomiting, and higher patient satisfaction was reported with analgesia. Similarly, we found no difference in postoperative pain between participants given FNB as opposed to local infiltration analgesia. Information was insufficient for review authors to conclude on the comparison of FNB with local infiltration analgesia or oral analgesia, or on the safety of the various analgesic techniques.
