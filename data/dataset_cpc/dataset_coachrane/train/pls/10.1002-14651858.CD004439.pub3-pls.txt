Antibiotics for treating chronic bone infection in adults
Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of the bone and bone marrow caused by pus‐forming bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. All bone infection that is long‐standing is called chronic osteomyelitis. People with this condition are treated with systemic antibiotics, which can be given by mouth or parenterally (i.e. by injection into the muscle or vein). This review is an update of our previous 2009 publication. 
We included eight small randomised trials involving 282 people. The trials presented results for a total of 248 people with chronic osteomyelitis. Post‐traumatic bone infections were the most frequent type. Surgical removal of the infected tissue (debridement) before starting on antibiotic therapy was mentioned as part of treatment in all trials, but in four trials it was unclear whether all participants underwent surgery. There were five comparisons of different treatments but we could only pool results for the comparison of antibiotic given by mouth with antibiotic given parenterally. 
The pooled results (which included data from 150 people) did not show any difference between people given antibiotics by mouth or parenterally in terms of the number of people who did not have symptoms (in 'remission') at the end of treatment (four trials) or 12 months later (or more) (three trials); nor in the number of people that had negative side effects or had a superinfection (another infection that is not sensitive to antibiotic treatment). This evidence suggests that the way antibiotics are given does not impact on the disease remission rate if the bacteria causing the infection are sensitive to the antibiotic used. However, confirmation is needed. There was either no or insufficient evidence on which to base judgements about the optimum length of antibiotic treatment or the best antibiotics to use.
