Interventions for treating abnormal tangles of blood vessels in the brain in adults
Question 
Do treatments for adults with abnormal tangles of blood vessels in the brain prevent death, disability and stroke due to bleeding compared to usual medical care? 
Background 
Abnormal tangles of blood vessels in the brain, known as brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the single most common cause of stroke due to bleeding in the brain (known as intracerebral haemorrhage, or ICH) in young adults. Brain AVMs can also leave young people disabled for life and cause epilepsy. How they should be treated, if at all, is highly controversial. The main options are: 1) medical treatment of epileptic seizures and headaches (sometimes known as 'conservative management'); or 2) one or more of the following 'interventional' treatments: neurosurgery, endovascular embolization (glue, coils, or particles are lodged within the AVM via a catheter inserted temporarily in the groin), or radiosurgery (a non‐invasive treatment involving focused beams of radiation).

Study characteristics 
We found one published randomized controlled trial, including 226 adults.
Key results 
We found moderate‐quality evidence of harm (stroke due to bleeding in the brain, and death or dependency) over one year of follow‐up from interventional treatments compared to conservative management for adults who had a brain AVM that had never bled. The long‐term risks are unknown. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate because there was just one trial and it did not use blinding. More information will become available from the three trials that are ongoing.
