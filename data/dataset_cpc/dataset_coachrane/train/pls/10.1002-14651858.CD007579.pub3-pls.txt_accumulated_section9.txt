Reducing nausea and vomiting in women having a caesarean birth with regional anaesthesia
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out from randomised controlled trials how effective drugs and other treatments are for reducing nausea and vomiting during and after caesarean section with epidural or spinal anaesthesia, when compared with an inactive control. We searched for all relevant studies to answer our review question (April 2020). 
Why is this important? 
Women often prefer to be awake for the birth of their child, so when possible, a caesarean is performed under regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural). Nausea and vomiting are commonly experienced during and immediately after caesarean section with regional anaesthesia. This is distressing for women. Vomiting during surgery can also challenge the operating surgeon and put the mother at risk of fluids from the stomach going into her windpipe. 
Several drugs are commonly used to reduce nausea and vomiting. There are also some non‐drug approaches such as acupressure/acupuncture and ginger. Possible side effects include headaches, dizziness, low blood pressure and itching. 
What evidence did we find? 
We identified 69 randomised controlled studies (involving 8928 women) that provided data. Data were mostly on non‐emergency caesareans and most findings were supported only by low or very low‐certainty evidence. This was due to many of the studies being old, with small numbers of participants or unclear methodology. A few outcomes had moderate‐certainty evidence. 
5‐HT3 antagonists (like ondansetron, granisetron): these probably reduce nausea after surgery, and they may also reduce nausea during surgery (low‐certainty evidence) and vomiting after surgery, but any effect on vomiting during surgery is unclear.
