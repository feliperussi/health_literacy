Intrauterine progesterone‐releasing system for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia
Review question 
Researchers in Cochrane reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of the levonorgestrel‐intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) compared with other forms of treatment in women with endometrial hyperplasia. 
Background 
Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is a thickening (or overgrowth) of the endometrium (inner lining) of the uterus (womb) resulting from an excess of the hormone oestrogen, which is not balanced by the hormone progesterone. Women with EH commonly present to their doctor with abnormal vaginal bleeding. EH increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer, and can be described as without atypia (associated with a low risk of progression to atypia and cancer) or with atypia (where the cells are structurally abnormal, and have a higher risk of developing cancer). Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and is most commonly diagnosed in women after the menopause, particularly around the sixth and seventh decades of life. The goal of treatment of EH is to prevent endometrial cancer from developing, and depends on the degree of atypia, menopausal status, and fertility preferences. Treatment can be medical (hormonal) or surgical (hysterectomy). 
Progestogen tablets taken daily is the usual treatment for EH without atypia and in some cases of EH with atypia in women wishing to preserve fertility or unable to tolerate surgery. Progestogen is not always successful at reversing EH and has side effects. The LNG‐IUS is a T‐shaped device placed into the uterus which slowly releases progestogen with a direct effect on the endometrium. It can be inserted in clinic and remain in place for up to five years. LNG‐IUS is an alternative approach to treat EH which may be more effective, have fewer side effects and be preferred by women.
