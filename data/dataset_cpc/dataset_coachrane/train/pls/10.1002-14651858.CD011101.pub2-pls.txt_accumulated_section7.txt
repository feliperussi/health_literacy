Methods to reduce shoulder pain after gynaecological keyhole surgery
Review question 
Cochrane authors wanted to find out how effective different methods (interventions) are in reducing the amount and severity of shoulder pain following gynaecological keyhole surgery. 
Background 
Gynaecological keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is a procedure where a surgeon uses a camera (laparoscope) to see inside the lower abdomen to view the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes and ovaries. They can also use special instruments to do tests or treat certain gynaecological conditions. This is a common procedure that about 250,000 women in the UK have each year. Up to 80% of these women may experience shoulder‐tip pain (STP), which may be very painful and lead to longer stays in hospital and even having to go back in to hospital. 
During the laparoscopy, the surgeon puts gas (carbon dioxide) into the patient’s abdomen (pneumoperitoneum). This inflates the abdomen so that the surgeon can see the organs in the abdominal cavity and can carry out surgery. It is possible that inflating the abdomen stimulates a nerve that runs from the top of the abdomen (diaphragm) up to the shoulders and neck, which causes STP. 
We looked at several ways surgeons try to reduce STP: putting local anaesthetic (pain killer) directly into the abdominal cavity or diaphragm; using warmed carbon dioxide, sometimes with moisture added to it (humidified) during surgery; removing gas from the abdominal cavity with drains; replacing gas with fluid (fluid instillation) or forcing gas out of the abdominal cavity at the end of the procedure by increasing the pressure at which patients were made to breathe whilst still under anaesthetic (PRM).
