Mobility management interventions to prevent, reduce, or delay driving in teenagers
Review question 
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before‐after studies (CBAs), on whether 'mobility management' can be used to prevent, reduce, or delay car driving in teenagers aged 15 to 19 years. 
Background 
Despite safety‐based educational programmes and programmes designed to restrict teenage driving (called graduated drivers licensing, or GDL), rates of injury and death caused by teenage car drivers remain high. Car use also leads to health risks caused by being less active physically, and environmental risks from burning fossil fuels. 
'Mobility management' is the term applied to strategies that encourage people of different ages to drive less. Examples include encouraging walking or cycling, use of public transport, or car sharing. People are more likely to make changes to how they live their lives in the period between the ages of 15 and 19 years. This may be the ideal time to introduce mobility management to prevent, reduce, or delay driving. This may influence long‐term car use, and reduce risks associated with driving. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and CBAs (CBAs are not randomised, but measure outcomes before and after an intervention is applied), published up to 16 August 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We found one small RCT. This study gave 178 university students (average age 18 years) who did not hold a driving licence, different types of information to educate them about the negative aspects of car use. Students received information about cost, risk, or stress related to car use, or a combination of all three, while a fifth group of students received no information.
