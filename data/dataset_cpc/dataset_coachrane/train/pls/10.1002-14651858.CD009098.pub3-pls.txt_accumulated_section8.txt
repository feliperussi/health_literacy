Effects of higher versus lower levels of pressure in the lungs at the end of each breath during mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
Review question 
We wanted to find evidence from randomised controlled trials on the benefits and harms of high versus low levels of lung positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP). We wanted to focus on adult patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These patients have low oxygen levels in the blood and therefore reduced tissue oxygenation. 
PEEP is pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) at the end of each breath (expiration). In mechanically ventilated patients, PEEP works against passive emptying of the lung and collapse of air sacs (alveoli). Collapse of air sacs can lead to incomplete inflation of the lung on the next breath and reduced oxygenation. PEEP is used to improve oxygenation. 
Background 
ALI and ARDS are caused by leakage of fluid in the lung and local inflammation that can cause widespread alveolar damage and a build‐up of fluid in the lungs. The build‐up of fluid can be seen on chest X‐rays. Alveolar damage can lead to later scarring (fibrosis). Common causes are pneumonia infection and more general (systemic) infection, as with sepsis. 
ALI and ARDS patients are placed on mechanical ventilation (delivery of positive pressure to the lungs, usually via a breathing tube). Mechanical ventilation is a method of artificial support for respiration that introduces gas into the patient's airway through an external mechanical system. Use of PEEP is one of the lung protection strategies aimed at improving oxygenation of patients and survival. 
The benefits and risks of PEEP are unclear, as it could increase the risk of lung damage called barotrauma. This occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall (pneumothorax). This air pushes on the outside of the lung and causes it to collapse.
