Dental treatments for preventing damage to the jawbones in people with cancer receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck 
Review question 
With this Cochrane Review we tried to find out the best way to prevent the death and exposure of bone in the jaws of people who have had radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. This is a condition called osteoradionecrosis (ORN). 
Background 
ORN of the jaws is a serious problem which can happen after people have radiotherapy as part of their treatment for head and neck cancer. ORN refers to the death and exposure of bone that result from damage to the tissues due to being exposed to radiation. ORN is very difficult to treat and it is important that steps are taken to prevent it. In this review, we looked at any treatments that have been used to prevent ORN. 
Study characteristics 
This review is up‐to‐date as of 5 November 2019. The review includes four studies involving 342 adults who had received radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer. The review looks at three different ways to prevent ORN: 
‐ the use of platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) in bone after removal of healthy teeth prior to radiotherapy. Plasma is a part of blood that contains special proteins that help the blood to clot, and PRP is concentrated plasma which supports cell growth. Injecting PRP into damaged tissue may stimulate the body to grow new, healthy cells to make it heal more quickly; 
‐ taking out teeth because of tooth decay makes the risk of developing ORN greater. Preventing tooth decay in people having radiotherapy is very important. We looked at a study comparing using fluoride gel with a toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal to prevent tooth decay after radiotherapy;
