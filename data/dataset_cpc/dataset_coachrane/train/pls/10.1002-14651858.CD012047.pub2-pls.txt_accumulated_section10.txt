Perioperative local anaesthesia for reducing pain following septal surgery
Review question 
Does local anaesthesia at the time of the operation (perioperative) reduce pain after surgery to the nasal septum and are there any adverse effects? 
Background 
Septal surgery is used to treat nasal obstruction due to deviation of the nasal septum. Local anaesthesia is used to decrease pain after the operation and there are several types (e.g. local injection, addition of local anaesthesia to nasal packing, if this is being used to manage bleeding after the operation, and regional nerve block). Most surgeons agree on the use of local anaesthesia, but the choice of which type to use depends on the surgeon's preference. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2018. We included seven studies, recruiting 493 patients. The participants were adults having septoplasty in all of the included studies and the percentage of females ranged from 20.7% to 58.3%. Two studies, recruiting 142 participants, assessed local anaesthetic injection. Four studies, recruiting 301 participants, used nasal packing postoperatively and assessed the addition of a local anaesthetic to the nasal pack. One study, recruiting 50 participants, assessed a regional nerve block. No studies were funded by the anaesthetic drug manufacturer. 
Key results 
Local anaesthetic injection compared to no treatment/placebo 
The main outcome we looked at was the effect on reducing pain at 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Two studies assessed local injection of anaesthesia, but neither reported on pain at these times. It is unclear whether local injection increased postoperative vomiting. Neither study reported uncontrollable postoperative bleeding.
