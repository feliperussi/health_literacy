Local cooling for relieving pain from perineal trauma sustained during childbirth
We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on how effective localised cooling treatments are for reducing pain from damage to the area between the vagina and the anus, that is, 'perineal trauma', when giving birth. 
What is the issue? 
Perineal tears are common during childbirth. In addition, sometimes the person attending the birth cuts the perineum to give extra room for the baby to be born (an episiotomy). 
These tears and cuts often cause pain and the mother may have difficulty walking or sitting comfortably, or to feed and care for her baby, 
Why is this important? 
The pain from perineal tears or cuts can decrease women’s ability to move around and causes discomfort when passing urine or faeces. This can affect her emotional well‐being. Persisting perineal pain can have longer‐term effects, such as pain during sex and problems with bowel movements and urination. Women are encouraged to use different ways to relieve the pain, including the use of cooling treatments such as ice packs or cold gel pads. It is important to know if cooling works and whether it can slow healing of the cut or tear. 
This is an update of a review that was first published in 2007 and updated in 2012.
What evidence did we find? 
We updated the search for evidence in October 2019. We have now found 10 randomised controlled trials to include. Nine of these studies had information from 998 women that we could use in the review.
