Ciclesonide compared to budesonide and fluticasone in the treatment of asthma in children
Asthma is a common disease in childhood. Most children with chronic asthma are treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to control airway inflammation and reduce asthma symptoms. Although these drugs are considered to be very safe and effective, not all children achieve full asthma control and some parents are concerned about the possibility of reduced growth or local side effects such as hoarseness. The challenge for newer ICS is to achieve improved asthma control with fewer side effects. This could be achieved by small‐particle‐size ICS, leading to better lung deposition as they penetrate deeper into the small airways. Therefore, asthma control could be achieved with lower daily doses and with fewer side effects. In children, particle size of ICS might be even more important because of their smaller airways. 
Ciclesonide is a new small‐particle‐size ICS. The smaller particle size may make the corticosteroid go deeper into the lungs. Potential advantages are a lower required dose to achieve asthma control, once daily instead of twice daily dosing, and reduced local (oral thrush) and systemic (growth suppression) side effects. 
We found six studies comparing ciclesonide with either budesonide or fluticasone in 3256 children (aged four to 17 years) with chronic asthma. After three months of treatment with ciclesonide compared to budesonide or fluticasone, no relevant differences could be found on asthma symptoms, exacerbations or side effects. Ciclesonide compared to a double dose of fluticasone was assessed in one study and no differences were found in asthma symptoms, use of rescue medication and adverse effects. However, children receiving ciclesonide experienced more asthma exacerbations than children in the fluticasone group.
