Nonselective beta‐blockers for treatment of high blood pressure
Background 
Beta‐blockers are a class of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Nonselective beta‐blockers are a subclass of beta‐blockers including propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), etc. We asked how much this subclass of drugs lower blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We developed a comprehensive search strategy of all relevant scientific databases to identify all clinical trials to answer this question. Participants had to have a baseline systolic blood pressure (the top number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 90 mmHg, or both of these. We did not restrict participants by age, gender, baseline risk or any other medical conditions. 
Key results 
We found 25 clinical trials that compared the blood pressure lowering effect of seven nonselective beta‐blockers with placebo in 1264 people with high blood pressure. On average, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered blood pressure by about 10 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic, and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. This estimate is likely greater than the true effect because of biases in the running and reporting of the trials. We did not find convincing evidence that higher doses of nonselective beta‐blockers lowered blood pressure more than lower doses. However, higher doses of nonselective beta‐blockers significantly lowered heart rate compared with lower doses, which could lead to more side effects. Since the blood pressure lowering effect for systolic is similar to the blood pressure lowering effect of diastolic, the effect of this subclass on pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic) was small at about 2 mmHg. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence is low due to the presence of extreme outliers and high risk of biases.
