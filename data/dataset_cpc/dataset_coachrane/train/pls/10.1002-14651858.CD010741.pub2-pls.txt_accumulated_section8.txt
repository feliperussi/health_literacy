Normal saline versus lower‐chloride solutions for kidney transplantation
What is the issue? 
People with kidney failure may have a kidney transplant to replace the function of their own kidneys. During a kidney transplant operation, patients receive fluids through their veins to keep them hydrated. Maintaining good hydration helps the transplanted kidney to work after the operation. The choice of fluids that are given during and after the operation may have an effect on how the transplant kidney works after surgery and on the patient's acid‐base measures in the blood. 
Normal saline is a type of fluid that is commonly given during an operation. It contains a high chloride level. Giving a kidney transplant patient normal saline might increase the acid level of the blood compared to giving the patient fluids that contain less chloride. High blood acid levels might be associated with high blood potassium levels, which is dangerous for the heart and often requires dialysis to correct. 
What did we do? 
We performed a systematic review to address the question of whether giving lower‐chloride fluids compared to normal saline during the kidney transplant operation alters the early function of the kidney, the number of patients with high blood potassium levels, and the acid level in the blood after the operation. We included studies that were published up to November 26, 2015. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies that included 477 kidney transplant patients. The majority of these patients had a kidney transplant from a living donor. The overall quality of the studies was low to average, and the main problem was the small number of studies and the small size of the studies. There was no information on funding source for most of the studies.
