Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation for improving everyday activities in people after stroke 
Review question Is repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) effective for improving daily activities in people after stroke? 
Background Stroke, the most common cause of disability, occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. Two types of stroke are known: ischaemic (due to lack of blood flow) and haemorrhagic (due to bleeding). Paralysis of the arm or leg after stroke causes problems with daily activities and functions, including eating, showering, dressing, and walking. People after stroke with hemiparesis require physical rehabilitation, that is, training of upper and lower limbs, exercise focused on activities of daily living, and fitting of appropriate walking aids (e.g. cane). However, effective treatments are currently limited. rPMS is a painless method of stimulation that has been used to try to improve movement in people with brain or nerve disorders.

Study characteristics This is an update of the review published in 2017. We examined the evidence from four trials of rPMS (three individual RCTs and one cross‚Äêover trial) involving a total of 139 participants. Two studies compared rPMS against 'sham' stimulation (a very weak stimulation or a sound only). Two studies compared rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. 
Key results We found little evidence for the use of rPMS to improve activities of daily living, muscle strength, upper limb function, and spasticity (unusual stiffness of muscles) in people after stroke. Although one trial reported that rPMS reduced spasticity of the upper limb, the effect was small and remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence We classified the quality of the evidence as low for improving activities of daily living, mainly because one study had a small sample size.
