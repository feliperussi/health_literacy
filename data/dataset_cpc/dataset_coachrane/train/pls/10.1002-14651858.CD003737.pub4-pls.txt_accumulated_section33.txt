What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye.
