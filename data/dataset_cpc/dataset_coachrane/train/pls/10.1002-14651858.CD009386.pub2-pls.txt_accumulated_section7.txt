Internet‐based programmes for people with heart disease
Review question 
Are Internet‐based support programmes for people with heart disease helpful in improving their heart disease condition? 
Background 
Heart disease is the most common cause of ill health and preventable death. Cardiac rehabilitation is a programme that helps people with heart disease gain better health. It is held in group classes that take place at hospitals or within the community. People attend these classes once or twice a week for around six to eight weeks. The classes usually involve exercising, and receiving advice on ways to improve their health. People needing these programmes are not always able to attend them. An alternative is to provide this programme through the Internet. In this review we looked at whether programmes delivered through the Internet are helpful in improving death rates, the need for surgery, repeated heart attacks, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, health‐related quality of life (HRQOL), diet, physical activity, medication compliance, healthcare usage, and costs. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to December 2014. We included 18 studies. Eleven are complete, and seven are ongoing. In the completed studies, 1392 people with coronary heart disease were recruited. The average age of participants ranged from 54.9 to 66.27 years. The majority of people recruited were men. Studies were carried out worldwide, and in a variety of healthcare settings. Seven studies tested broad programmes targeting multiple lifestyle factors related to heart disease. Four studies tested programmes focused only on increasing levels of physical activity. The length of the programmes in the included studies ranged from six weeks to one year. These programmes were compared to no intervention in six studies, some support in three studies, and full traditional rehabilitation in two studies.
