Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery
What is the issue? 
Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a ‘breech presentation’ the unborn baby is bottom‐down instead of head‐down. Babies born bottom‐first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head‐first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. We looked at evidence comparing planned caesarean sections and vaginal births at the normal time of birth. 
Why is this important? 
Although having a caesarean might reduce some risks to babies who are lying bottom‐first, the operation itself has other risks for the mother and the baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 3 studies involving 2396 women. (We included studies up to March 2015.) The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was mainly low. In the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. However, children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two, though the numbers were too small to be certain. Caesareans caused some short‐term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain in one study. The studies did not look at effects on future pregnancies, when having had a previous caesarean may cause complications. The studies only looked at single births (not twins or triplets) and did not study premature babies.
