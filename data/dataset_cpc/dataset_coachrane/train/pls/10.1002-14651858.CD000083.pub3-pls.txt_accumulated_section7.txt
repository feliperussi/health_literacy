Effects of turning unborn babies from bottom first to head first at the end of pregnancy (around 36 weeks or more) for reducing problems during childbirth 
What is the issue? 
The best outcomes in childbirth for both mothers and babies are when the baby is born head‐first. If the baby is in another position, there is a higher risk of complications including the need for caesarean section. In a ‘breech presentation’ the baby is bottom‐down instead of head‐down. External cephalic version (ECV) is a technique for turning the unborn baby so it lies head‐down. This review looked at the effects of using ECV on babies that were in the breech position at the end of pregnancy (around 36 weeks or more). 
Why is this important? 
Everyone wants to avoid complications in childbirth and many women want to avoid having a caesarean section. Avoiding the need for surgery is very important in countries with limited resources for healthcare. ECV is sometimes used before the end of pregnancy (around 34 weeks) but the results might be different when it is used just before childbirth. Also, it might not be possible to turn the unborn baby at this late stage. We wanted to know if using ECV at the end of pregnancy resulted in safer childbirth or was harmful. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 8 studies involving 1308 women. (We included studies up to 28 February 2015.) All the studies were randomised and involved women with low‐risk pregnancies. Using ECV around 36 weeks or more increased the chance that babies were born head‐first and reduced the risk of having a caesarean section. There were no clear differences in other outcomes such as the risk of babies dying. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was varied.
