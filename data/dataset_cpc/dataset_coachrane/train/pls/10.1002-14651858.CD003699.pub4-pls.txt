Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure or continuous positive airway pressure for children with acute respiratory failure and shortage of oxygen 
Children develop respiratory failure and shortage of oxygen when they have infectious or non‐infectious respiratory illnesses. Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP) which keeps lungs open by creating negative pressure on the chest or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which keeps lungs open by delivering positive pressure in the lungs during all phases of breathing are used to help increase blood oxygen levels in respiratory failure and thereby reduce organ damage and risk of death. However, the safety and efficacy of these methods of respiratory support are uncertain. The searches for this review were updated in July 2013. 
We included two studies in the review: one study of CNEP included 33 participants younger than one year old who had bronchiolitis and one study of CPAP included 37 participants who had dengue fever related illness. Both studies reported short‐term improvements but no reports of clinically significant outcomes are available. With a small number of patients in both studies, the safety of either approach could not be evaluated. Both studies have methodological issues and were under‐powered (had too few patients to detect a significant difference). No adverse events were reported in ether of the included trials. Well‐designed, multicentre, controlled studies with adequate numbers of infants and which assess clinically important outcomes are needed, as we cannot comment on the safety of the intervention as it was not evaluated in the current studies. The major limitation of this review is that it has a very limited number of studies which include a very small sample of children.
