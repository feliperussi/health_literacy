Anticholinergic drugs versus non‐drug active therapies for overactive bladder syndrome in adults without neurological problems 
Overactive bladder syndrome occurs in adults who have urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence (leakage of urine).  People usually empty their bladders frequently during the day and also at night (nocturia). It is a major problem affecting quality of life, in over 22 million people. It affects men and women, and is more common in women and in older people.  It is also expensive for both patients and the health service.  It is not clear exactly why it occurs, and there are many treatments including drugs and behavioural treatments such as bladder training and pelvic floor exercises.  It is not clear which treatments work best, have the fewest side effects and which are most economical.  Twenty three trials with 3685 participants were included in the review. Participants were more likely to improve if they were using an anticholinergic drug compared with bladder training alone, and also when using a combination of an anticholinergic drug plus bladder training.  More people reported an improvement in their overactive bladder symptoms when using electrical stimulation than an anticholinergic drug, but this was only significant in one trial for one type of electrical stimulation, percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation.  These results have to be viewed with caution as different types and doses of the anticholinergic drugs were used in the trials. The main adverse effect reported was dry mouth, in about a third of the people taking an anticholinergic drug.
