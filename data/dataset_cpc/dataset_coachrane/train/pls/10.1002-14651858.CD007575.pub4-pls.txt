Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy
Nausea, retching or dry heaving, and vomiting in early pregnancy are very common and can be very distressing for women. Many treatments are available to women with 'morning sickness', including drugs and complementary and alternative therapies. Because of concerns that taking medications may adversely affect the development of the fetus, this review aimed to examine if these treatments have been found to be effective and safe. 
This review found a lack of high‚Äêquality evidence to back up any advice on which interventions to use. We examined 41 randomised controlled trials that included 5449 women in early pregnancy. These studies examined the effectiveness of many treatments including acupressure to the P6 point on the wrist, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, vitamin B6, lemon oil, mint oil, and several drugs that are used to reduce nausea or vomiting. Some studies showed a benefit in improving nausea and vomiting symptoms for women, but generally effects were inconsistent and limited. Overall, studies had low risk of bias related to blinding and reporting on all participants in the studies. However some aspects of the studies were reported incompletely in a way that meant how participants were allocated to groups was unclear and not all results were fully and clearly reported. Most studies had different ways of measuring the symptoms of nausea and vomiting and therefore, we could not look at these findings together. Few studies reported maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and there was very little information on the effectiveness of treatments for improving women's quality of life.
