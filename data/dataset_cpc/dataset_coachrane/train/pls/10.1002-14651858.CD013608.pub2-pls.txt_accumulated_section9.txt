D‐mannose (sugar tablets) for preventing or treating urinary tract infections in adults and children 
What is the issue? 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common around the world. At least 50% of females will have a UTI once in their lifetime. Approximately 15% to 25% of adults and children suffer from repeated and long‐term UTIs. In many people, standard antibiotics do not work. 
D‐mannose is a sugar which is part of a normal diet and is believed to create a non‐stick surface on the bladder wall, as well as around the bacteria. It is thought that the bacteria is then expelled when urinating, thus preventing the growth of bacteria which leads to an infection inside the bladder or urinary tract. 
What did we do? 
We reviewed all of the evidence on D‐mannose (tablets or powder) to see whether it can prevent or treat UTIs in adults and children. The evidence is current to 22 February 2022. 
What did we find? 
We found seven studies enrolling 719 participants, mostly in females who experience recurrent UTIs (at least 2 episodes in 6 months or 3 episodes in 12 months) on a long‐term basis. We could not combine the data because each study investigated different D‐mannose preparations, different populations, and different control groups. We were unable to determine if taking D‐mannose compared to no treatment, other supplements, or antibiotics reduced the number of repeated UTIs. Only a small number of participants experienced diarrhoea or vaginal burning as a side effect. 
The quality of the evidence is poor. Studies were conducted using poor‐quality methods and did not enrol enough patients. Only two out of the seven studies blinded the participants to the treatment they receive.
