Ultrasonography for diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease 
Background  Heavy alcohol consumption causes alcoholic liver disease and may lead to a number of other concomitant diseases. Alcohol may damage the function of body organs and can cause cancer. Liver damage due to excessive alcohol consumption is usually presented as fatty liver (build‐up of fats in the liver), steatohepatitis (inflammation of the liver with concurrent fat accumulation in the liver), fibrosis (fibrous degeneration), alcoholic cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and hepatocellular carcinoma (most common type of liver cancer). When liver fibrosis progresses, alcoholic cirrhosis occurs. 
Abstinence from alcohol may help people with alcoholic disease to improve their health at any stage of their disease; however, the more advanced the stage, the higher the risk of complications, co‐morbidities (presence of other diseases), and mortality (death), and lesser the effect of abstinence. Abstinence from alcohol one month after diagnosis of early cirrhosis will improve the chance of a seven‐year life expectancy by 1.6 times. Liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver) is the only radical method that may change the prognosis of a person with alcoholic liver disease; however, besides the difficulties of finding a suitable liver transplant organ, there are many other factors that may influence a person's survival after transplantation. 
Ultrasound is an inexpensive method that has been used for years in clinical practice to diagnose alcoholic cirrhosis. Ultrasound parameters for assessing cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease encompass among others liver size, bluntness of the liver edge, coarseness of the liver parenchyma (part of the liver that filters blood to remove toxins), nodularity (unevenness) of the liver surface, size of the lymph nodes (small glands that filter lymph) around the hepatic artery (which supplies oxygenated blood to the liver), irregularity and narrowness of the inferior vena cava (which carries blood from the lower body to the heart), portal vein velocity, and spleen size.
