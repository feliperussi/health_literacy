Frequency of suctioning inside the tube that is used to ventilate newborn babies
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different strategies in the frequency of suctioning of newborn babies that are on ventilators. Our main interest was prevention of lung damage. 
Background 
Newborns might need help with breathing as their lungs are still maturing. An airway catheter (tube) is inserted into the mouth or nose in order to maintain an open airway (patency) in newborns who are unable to breathe on their own. This procedure is called endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal tube suction is necessary to clear secretions and to maintain airway patency, therefore ensuring that the baby receives enough oxygen. The goal of endotracheal intubation suction should be remove as much of the secretions as possible with minimal side effects associated with the procedure. However, suctioning causes stress, pain, and inflammation (swelling) of the windpipe in newborns. The optimal frequency of suctioning has not been defined. Suctioning inside the airway tube might be performed 'as scheduled' by the specialist or only 'as needed'. Moreover, the 'as scheduled' approach might be more or less frequent. We explored the current evidence, up to October 2015, supporting one schedule or another. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for clinical studies comparing different strategies regarding the frequency of endotracheal tube suction in newborn babies on ventilators. We found only one study recruiting 97 newborns with bodyweights under 2.5 kg (these are called low birthweight infants). Suctioning was performed every six or 12 hours during the first three days of life.
