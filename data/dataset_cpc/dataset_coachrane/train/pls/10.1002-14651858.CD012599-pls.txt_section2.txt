Background  Down's syndrome (also known as Down's or Trisomy 21) is an incurable genetic disorder that causes significant physical and mental health problems, and disabilities. However, there is wide variation in how Down's affects people. Some individuals are severely affected whilst others have mild problems and are able to lead relatively normal lives. There is no way of predicting how badly a baby might be affected.  Expectant parents are given the choice to be tested for Down’s syndrome during pregnancy to assist them in making decisions. If a mother is carrying a baby with Down’s syndrome, then there is the decision about whether to terminate or continue with the pregnancy. The information offers parents the opportunity to plan for life with a child with Down’s syndrome.  The most accurate tests for Down’s syndrome involve testing fluid from around the baby (amniocentesis) or tissue from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling (CVS)) for the abnormal chromosomes associated with Down’s syndrome. Both these tests involve inserting needles through the mother's abdomen and are known to increase the risk of miscarriage. Thus, the tests may not be suitable for all pregnant women. Rather, tests that measure markers in the mother’s blood, urine, or on ultrasound scans of the baby are used for screening. These screening tests are not perfect as they can miss cases of Down’s syndrome and also give high risk test results to a number of women whose babies are not affected by Down’s syndrome. Thus, pregnancies identified as high risk using these screening tests require further testing using amniocentesis or CVS to confirm a diagnosis of Down’s syndrome.
