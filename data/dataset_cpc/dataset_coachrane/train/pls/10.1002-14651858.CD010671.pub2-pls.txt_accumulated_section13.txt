Yoga treatment for chronic non‐specific low back pain
Review question 
Does yoga improve back‐related function and pain in people with chronic non‐specific low back pain? 
Background 
Low back pain is a common health problem. For some people, it may last for three months or more and at this point it is termed 'chronic'. Yoga is sometimes used as a treatment for low back pain. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases for trials comparing yoga to any other treatment or to no treatment in adults (aged 18 years or greater). We also included trials comparing yoga added to other treatments, versus those other treatments alone. The evidence is current to March 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 trials with 1080 participants. Seven studies were carried out in the USA, three studies were carried out in India, and two studies were carried out in the UK. All studies measured changes in back‐related function or pain. Few studies reported on quality of life or depression, and only about half of the studies said anything about harms. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies did not report the source of funding. One study reported not receiving any funding; one study was funded by a yoga institution; and seven studies were funded by charity, university, or government sources. 
Key results 
Seven studies compared yoga to non‐exercise, which included no treatment, delayed yoga treatment, or education (e.g. booklets and lectures). Three studies compared yoga to back‐focused exercise or similar exercise programmes. Two studies had three treatment groups and compared yoga, non‐exercise, and back‐focused exercise. One of the studies comparing yoga to back‐focused exercise compared yoga plus back‐focused exercise to back‐focused exercise alone.
