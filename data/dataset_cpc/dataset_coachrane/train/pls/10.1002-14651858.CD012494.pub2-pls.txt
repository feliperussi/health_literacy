Cholinesterase inhibitors for people with delirium, not including those in intensive care units 
Background 
During a period of illness, people can develop symptoms of confusion and altered consciousness, which is known as delirium. Compared to patients with no delirium, patients with delirium spend a longer time in hospital and are less likely to survive their illness. Treatment of delirium should focus on good care of the underlying illness and strategies such as reorientation of the patient. However, medication‐based treatments are still often used. Medications used for treating the symptoms of dementia (cholinesterase inhibitors) may have a role in treating delirium. 
Review question 
We wished to find out if treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitors reduces the severity or duration of delirium. We were also interested in side effects from cholinesterase inhibitors. Delirium is often seen in severe illnesses that require high levels of medical and nursing care, for example in the intensive care unit. In this review we focused on studies of patients who were not in a high‐level care setting. 
Study characteristics 
We found one trial from the UK, which included 15 participants with delirium. The average age of the participants was 82.5 years; eight participants were male and seven were female. Seven participants also had a history of dementia. This trial compared rivastigmine (a type of cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia) with an inactive treatment (placebo). 
Key results 
The trial did not show any difference in effect between those participants given rivastigmine and those given placebo. The study was conducted and reported appropriately, but the small number of participants limits any conclusions that could be made about rivastigmine as a treatment for delirium.
