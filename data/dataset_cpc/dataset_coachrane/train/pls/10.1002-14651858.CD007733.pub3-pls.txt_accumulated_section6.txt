Aerosols of prostacyclin for management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Background 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results in low oxygen levels in the blood and can develop when fluid builds up in the lungs because of inflammation. A direct or indirect injury to the lungs can cause ARDS in children and adults. Such injuries include sepsis (a serious condition where the body responds to infection by injuring to its own tissues and organs), viral infections, burns, massive blood transfusions, multiple trauma, entry of stomach contents into respiratory system, inflammation of the pancreas, inhalation injury, drug overdose and near drowning. ARDS is a major cause of death in critically ill people. 
Prostacyclin can be administered as an aerosol to critically ill adults and children with ARDS to increase the blood oxygen levels and improve survival. It is a naturally occurring prostaglandin that relaxes blood vessels, stops blood platelets from clotting (antiplatelet aggregation) and has anti‚Äêinflammatory properties in the lungs. 
Study characteristics 
This review was updated in 2017. We included two randomized controlled trials (RCT; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), one involving 14 critically ill children with ARDS and one involving 67 critically ill adults with ARDS. The trials did not measure severity of illness, resolution of organ dysfunction, length of stay in intensive care unit or hospital, and quality of life. The study authors did not report side effects such as bleeding, organ dysfunction, airway reactivity or side effects unrelated to the intervention.
