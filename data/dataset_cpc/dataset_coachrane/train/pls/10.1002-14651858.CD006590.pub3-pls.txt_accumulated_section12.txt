Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for the treatment of localised prostate cancer 
Review question 
How does surgery to remove the entire prostate compare to deferred treatment for patients with prostate cancer? 
Background 
Prostate cancer is a common cancer, especially in older men. Although infrequent, it can cause complaints such as blood in the urine or trouble urinating. It can spread to other organs such as lymph nodes and/or bones. At advanced stages, prostate cancer cannot be cured, can cause other symptoms, and will ultimately lead to death. 
Radical prostatectomy removes the entire prostate. It is a procedure used to treat men in case prostate cancer appears to be limited to the prostate and has not spread beyond. Men may choose not to have treatment at first and to later treat the complications. This is called watchful waiting. Some men will choose not to be treated at first, to monitor their cancer until it becomes more aggressive, and to later have treatment for cure. This is called active surveillance. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature until 3 March 2020. We found four randomised controlled trials, including 2635 men with prostate cancer, that compared radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting (3 studies) and one study that compared radical prostatectomy with active monitoring, which is an earlier form of active surveillance. 
Key results 
Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting  
Radical prostatectomy probably reduces the risk of dying for any reason, reduces the risk of dying from prostate cancer, reduces the risk of cancer becoming more aggressive, and reduces the risk of cancer spreading to other parts of the body (like lymph nodes and bones) after 29 years' follow‚Äêup. 
The number of patients reporting high general quality of life is probably similar after 12 years. Risks of urine leakage and problems with erections are probably greater for patients who receive surgery.
