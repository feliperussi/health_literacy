Corticosteroids for the management of nausea and vomiting not related to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery in adult cancer patients 
Background 
Nausea is a common symptom in advanced cancer. While nausea and vomiting can be related to cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery, a significant number of people with advanced cancer also suffer from nausea unrelated to such therapies. Nausea and vomiting may also cause psychological distress, and have a negative impact on the quality of life of cancer patients; it is often under‐treated. 
Study characteristics 
In August 2016, we found three relevant studies with 451 participants. The trial size varied from 51 to 280 participants. The duration of the included studies ranged from seven to 14 days. Two studies compared dexamethasone to placebo. The third study compared a number of additional medicines in various combinations, including metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, tropisetron, and dexamethasone. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
The current evidence is based on a small number of studies with a small number of participants. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We made the following conclusions from the available evidence: 
1) we found very low‐quality evidence of the effects of steroids on nausea and vomiting in cancer patients; 
2) there was no evidence about how steroids work in different types of cancer; and
3) there were few reported side effects, and the drugs were generally well tolerated. More high quality studies are needed to determine if steroids are effective anti‐nausea agents.
