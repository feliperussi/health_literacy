Urgent‐start peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people with chronic kidney disease 
What is the issue? 
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established form of kidney replacement therapy using the patient’s own peritoneal membrane (inner lining of the abdomen) as a filter for dialysis. Traditionally, initiation of PD has been delayed for 2 weeks after the placement of a PD catheter to allow time for wound healing. However, some patients require dialysis urgently and are unable to wait for 2 weeks. In order to avoid an additional procedure of insertion of a catheter for haemodialysis (HD) in PD patients, there have been studies reporting the successful start of PD urgently within 2 weeks of PD catheter insertion. The review compared the outcomes of PD patients who commenced PD urgently with those HD patients who commenced dialysis using a catheter. 
What did we do? 
We performed a systemic review to look at the benefits and harms of patients with chronic kidney disease who commenced urgent PD (usually within 2 weeks of PD catheter insertion) with those who underwent HD using a dialysis catheter. 
What did we find? 
We identified 7 studies (991 participants) comparing the risks and benefits of urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis using a catheter. We found that patients who underwent urgent PD may have a lower risk of blood‐stream infection (presence of bacteria in the blood) compared with patients who underwent HD using a dialysis catheter. The differences in the risks of having other infectious complications and mechanical complications of a dialysis catheter, or sustainability on the original type of dialysis treatment (PD or HD) between the two modes of dialysis were uncertain.
