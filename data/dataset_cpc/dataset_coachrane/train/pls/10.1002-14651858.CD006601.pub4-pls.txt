Codeine, alone and with paracetamol (acetaminophen), for cancer pain
Codeine is an opioid medication commonly used worldwide to treat pain including cancer pain. Oral codeine, either alone or in combination with paracetamol, provided good pain relief for some people with cancer pain, based on limited amounts of information. 
In this review we set out to estimate how well codeine worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were ‐ for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their oral codeine. We included 15 studies with 721 participants. The studies we found had methodological shortcomings: they were small and of short duration. They also reported results in different ways, so that it was not possible to combine results. In seven of the eight studies that compared codeine with placebo, codeine was better than placebo. In studies that compared codeine with another drug, the results were similar. Codeine at doses of 30 mg to 120 mg, alone or in combination with paracetamol, does seem to provide a good level of pain relief for some people with cancer pain. We cannot be certain about how many people will get this benefit, and we do not know whether, or by how much, adding paracetamol increases its effect. Codeine increases nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and may cause drowsiness or dizziness if used for more than a week. Some people will stop taking codeine because of the side effects. 
More trials comparing codeine with other treatments and using patient‐centred outcomes are needed. The role of codeine in mild cancer pain, in addition to moderate to severe cancer pain, should be investigated.
