What are the benefits and risks of tocilizumab (a medicine that reduces inflammation) for treating giant cell arteritis (a disease of the blood vessels)? 
Key messages· People with giant cell arteritis who have an injection of tocilizumab every week or two weeks have an improved chance of being symptom‐free after a year. People treated with tocilizumab every four weeks probably have an improved chance of being symptom‐free after a year. 
· Tocilizumab probably causes similar numbers of adverse (unwanted) effects to a placebo (dummy treatment). 
· More studies are needed to strengthen the body of evidence and investigate whether duration of treatment affects the success of tocilizumab. 
What is giant cell arteritis?Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammation (swelling) of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries). It usually affects people aged over 50 and can cause: 
· vision problems (such as double vision or vision loss in one or both eye(s));
· jaw pain while eating or talking;
· pain and tenderness over the temples (sides of the head);
· frequent and severe headaches; and
· weight loss.
If untreated, GCA can cause permanent loss of vision or a stroke.
How is GCA treated?GCA is usually treated with anti‐inflammation medicines called steroids. People typically need to take steroids for several years, which can cause adverse effects such as diabetes, osteoporosis (bone loss), hypertension (raised blood pressure), and infection. 
A possible alternative treatment is an injectable medicine called tocilizumab, which aims to stop the body’s defense system (immune system) from mistakenly attacking its healthy tissues and causing inflammation. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to compare the benefits and risks of tocilizumab against those of other treatments for GCA. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared tocilizumab against other treatments for GCA. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes of participant groups. 
What did we find?We found two studies, conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe, involving a total of 281 people with GCA. Everyone taking part in the study was aged over 50 (average age: 70), and 74% were women. Tocilizumab was given every four weeks in one study (30 people) and every week or every two weeks in the other study (251 people). Both studies lasted one year, and compared tocilizumab against a placebo. Both studies were funded by the manufacturer of tocilizumab. 
Tocilizumab given every four weeks compared to placebo 
The evidence suggests that after a year of treatment, compared to placebo, tocilizumab given every four weeks probably: 
· improves the chances of successful GCA treatment (absence of symptoms);
· delays the return of GCA; and
· reduces the need to use steroids to treat GCA.
Tocilizumab given every one or two weeks compared to placebo 
Tocilizumab given either every week or every two weeks for a year:
· improves the chances of successful GCA treatment;
· probably improves the chances of not needing escape therapy;
· probably improves physical and mental quality of life (well‐being); but
· probably makes little or no difference to changes in vision.
Adverse effects 
The most common adverse effect experienced by people taking part in the study was infection. The evidence suggests that tocilizumab probably decreases the number of serious adverse effects compared to placebo.
