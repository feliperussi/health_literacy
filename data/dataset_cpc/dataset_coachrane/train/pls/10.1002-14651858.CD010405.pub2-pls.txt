Co‐enzyme Q10 supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the result of complications of the heart and blood vessels and is a worldwide healthcare burden. However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable risk factors, such as diet. Dietary supplements have received a great deal of attention for the prevention of CVD. One such supplement is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is an antioxidant. Deficiencies in CoQ10 have been associated with CVD. This review therefore assessed the effectiveness of CoQ10 supplementation for CVD prevention. We included trials administering CoQ10 as a single supplement in healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD (but without a diagnosis of CVD) and measuring cardiovascular events or major CVD risk factors, such as blood pressure and lipid levels. We found six completed randomised controlled trials with a total of 218 participants randomised. All were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD. Two examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy. The trials were small and short‐term, none measured cardiovascular events or adverse events, and we regarded two of the six trials as being at high risk of bias. Very few small trials contributed to the analyses and no conclusions can be drawn at this time. We also identified five ongoing trials and the results from these will add to the evidence base in due course. More longer‐term trials are needed to determine the effect of CoQ10 on cardiovascular events.
