Endometrial injection of embryo culture supernatant for subfertile women in assisted reproduction 
Review question: 
Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of endometrial injection of embryo culture supernatant before embryo transfer in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Background: 
Assisted reproduction techniques (ART) includes techniques used for treating subfertility, and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are the most common. Despite both clinical and laboratory efforts and improvements in the success of these treatments, pregnancy rates remain relatively low. In IVF, eggs are retrieved from a woman's ovaries and placed in a dish with sperm from her partner or from a donor, in a liquid called embryo culture medium. In ICSI, a single sperm cell is injected into a woman's egg, and then the egg goes into the culture medium. 
Various factors allow a communication of embryo with maternal tissues. These could affect the receptivity of the lining of the womb (endometrium). Researchers have proposed that injecting the upper layer of the embryo culture's liquid, called supernatant, into the womb before embryo transfer, might stimulate the lining of the womb and facilitate the embryo's attachment to it. This could improve live birth rates and other ART outcomes. 
Although injection before embryo transfer seems to be an encouraging procedure, its effectiveness and safety remain controversial, as there is not much available evidence about outcomes. In this Cochrane Review, we summarised the relevant evidence. We aimed for our conclusions to be as robust as possible, and also to identify any limitations to the evidence.
