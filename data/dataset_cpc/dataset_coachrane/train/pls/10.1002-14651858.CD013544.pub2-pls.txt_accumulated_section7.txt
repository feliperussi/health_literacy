What interventions promote physical activity in people living with neuromuscular disease?
Review question 
We looked at the evidence on ways to increase physical activity in people with neuromuscular disease. We only included studies that measured physical activity as an outcome. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Background 
Physical activity includes any type of everyday activity, such as work, travel, or exercise. Based on well‐known health benefits, international guidance recommends that everyone does enough regular physical activity. This guidance is relevant to people with health conditions, including neuromuscular diseases, which affect the way that muscles and nerves work. However, many people with neuromuscular disease live with disability and face barriers to being more physically active. Research studies also sometimes exclude people who have health conditions. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 13 studies (795 participants from 12 studies; the number of participants was unclear in one study). The studies mostly involved adults who were able to walk, although our review question included people of any age who were able to move around with or without assistance. Only one study intervention had a stated aim to increase physical activity. The main focus of most studies was to assess the effects of physical activity interventions on other aspects of health, fitness, and well‐being. Interventions involved supported exercise or other types of physical activity, advice about being more active, or talking therapies that included changing everyday activity behaviour. Physical therapists and other health and fitness professionals provided the support for most interventions.
