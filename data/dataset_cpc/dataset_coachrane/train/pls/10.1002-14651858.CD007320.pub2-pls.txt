Joint lavage for osteoarthritis of the knee
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of joint lavage for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.  The review shows that in people with OA, joint lavage; 
‐ may not improve pain and function compared to a sham treatment or no treatment.
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects.  
What is osteoarthritis and what is joint lavage 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, and knees. In OA, the cartilage breaks down and may cause swelling and consecutive pain. OA can occur in different areas of the knee or the whole knee. When the cartilage breaks down, bits of tissue are left around the knee joint, which can add to the inflammation and prevent the joint from working properly.   Joint lavage means to wash out any loose tissue or debris from inside the joint space. It involves temporally inserting small tubes into 1 or more entry points into the knee. 
This systematic review discusses three types of joint lavage. Tidal irrigation joint lavage uses only one entry point to alternately inject fluid, and then draw it out.   Non‐arthroscopic joint lavage uses two entry points, one to inject the fluid and a separate one for the withdrawal of the fluid, but no visual inspection of the knee is performed.  Arthroscopic joint lavage is a formal joint lavage in addition to a visually inspection of the knee joints structures as this is done.
