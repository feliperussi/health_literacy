Doppler ultrasound of blood vessels in the placenta and uterus of pregnant women as a way of improving outcome for babies and their mothers 
One of the main aims of routine antenatal care is to identify mothers or babies at risk of adverse outcomes. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to detect the movement of blood in blood vessels. It is used in pregnancy to study blood circulation in the baby, the mother's uterus and the placenta. If abnormal blood circulation is identified, then it is possible that medical interventions might improve outcomes. We set out to assess the value of using Doppler ultrasound of the mother's uterus or placenta (utero‐placental Doppler ultrasound) as a screening tool. Other reviews have looked at the use of Doppler ultrasound on the babies' vessels (fetal and umbilical Doppler ultrasound). We also choose to look at women with low‐risk and high‐risk pregnancies, and in their first or second trimesters. This screening offers a potential for benefit, but also a possibility of unnecessary interventions and adverse effects. The review of randomised controlled trials of routine Doppler ultrasound of the uterus or placenta identified two studies involving 4993 women. All the women were in the second trimester of pregnancy and at low risk for hypertensive disorders. The studies were of good quality but small in size. We identified no improvements for the baby or the mother. However, more data would be needed to show whether maternal Doppler is effective, or not, for improving outcomes. We did not find any studies in the first trimester of pregnancy or in women at risk of high blood pressure disorders. More research is needed on this important aspect of care.
