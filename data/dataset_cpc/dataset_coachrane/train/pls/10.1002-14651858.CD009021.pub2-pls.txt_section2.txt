Each year, a significant number of pregnant women around the world develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance or high blood glucose concentration (hyperglycaemia) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. During normal pregnancy, insulin becomes less effective in transferring glucose from the blood stream to the mother’s tissues to ensure an adequate nutrient supply to the baby. This insulin resistance increases as the pregnancy advances and GDM occurs when a mother does not secrete enough insulin to be able to meet this resistance. Women with GDM are at risk of future type 2 diabetes and their babies are at increased risk of adverse outcomes including being large‐for‐gestational age, having birthweight of at least 4000 grams and birth trauma. The modifiable risk factors for GDM include being overweight or obese; physical inactivity or sedentary lifestyle; low fibre and high glycaemic load diet and polycystic ovarian syndrome. This review aimed to assess the effects of physical exercise for pregnant women in preventing glucose intolerance or GDM and was based on limited evidence from five randomised controlled trials. Two trials involved obese women. The trials provided data from 922 women and their babies and were of moderate risk of bias. The exercise programs including individualised exercise with regular advice, weekly supervised group exercise session or home‐based stationary cycling, either supervised or unsupervised, had no clear effect on preventing GDM (three trials with 826 women screened at 18 to 36 weeks' gestation), or improving insulin sensitivity (five trials) compared with standard antenatal care with normal daily activities. Based on these limited data, conclusive evidence is not available to guide practice. Larger, well‐designed randomised trials are needed. Several such trials are in progress. We identified another seven trials which are ongoing and we will consider these for inclusion in the next update.
