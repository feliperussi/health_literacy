Comparision of two techniques for the placement of a feeding tube to the stomach through the skin in an individual who has difficulty swallowing food 
Review question 
This systematic review was conducted to compare two different methods for placing a feeding tube to the stomach via an opening in the skin (known as percutaneous gastrostomy) in order to provide food to an individual with swallowing difficulties; the aim was to find the most effective and safe approach. 
Background 
Placing a feeding (gastric) tube to the stomach percutaneously (through an opening in the skin) is a less‚Äêinvasive method than open surgery. Percutaneous gastrostomy can be guided either using an optical instrument (or endoscope) that can be used to look inside the body (termed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG) or using guidance from external techniques that are used to obtain an image of the inside of the body (known as percutaneous radiological gastrostomy or PRG). Both PEG and PRG are associated with high rates of success in the placement of gastric tubes, but which is the best method has yet to be determined. 
Study characteristics 
We searched a number of online resources to identify studies that compared PEG and PRG in individuals with swallowing disturbances in a randomised controlled manner. This type of study is the best research method for identifying any differences between two techniques used for the same procedure. 
Key results 
We identified no randomised controlled studies comparing PEG and PRG in individuals with swallowing disturbances. Because of this lack of evidence, we are therefore not currently able to determine which technique is superior to the other for the placement of a gastric tube, and can make no definitive recommendations. Randomised controlled trials are required in order to determine the optimal method for percutaneous gastrostomy in individuals with swallowing difficulties.
