Drugs to prevent the re‐occurrence of narrowing of blood vessels in peripheral arterial disease after the blood vessels have been surgically widened 
Peripheral arterial disease of leg arteries can progressively cause leg pain on walking, pain at rest, ulcers and gangrene because of reduced blood flow. An inflatable balloon catheter inserted into the artery is used to widen and unblock the affected artery (termed angioplasty) yet reoccurrence of narrowing (restenosis) or obstruction (reocclusion) frequently occurs because of platelet clumping (aggregation) and activated blood clotting in the damaged blood vessel. This review of 22 randomised clinical trials, with a combined total of 3529 patients, set out to determine if any drug was more effective than another in preventing occlusion or restenosis of the artery after the blood vessels have been surgically widened. For the majority of comparisons, only one study was available. Evidence suggests that some drugs which reduce platelet aggregation, such as higher‐dose aspirin, can reduce the rate of reocclusion six months after surgery, but evidence on associated side effects and for longer‐term restenosis rates is scarce. There is also some evidence of variation in effect according to different drugs, with reocclusion/restenosis rates lower in people taking cilostazol compared with ticlopidine 12 months after surgery and, in patients with more severe disease, those taking low molecular weight heparin in addition to aspirin compared with aspirin alone. Batroxobin plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone may be an effective treatment in diabetic patients. However, available trials are generally small and of variable quality and side effects of drugs are not consistently addressed. Further good quality, large‐scale randomised controlled trials, grouped by severity of disease, are required.
