Surgery for resolving symptoms associated with malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers 
Background 
Advanced cancer causes a range of complex problems for patients. In gynaecological (for example ovarian and womb) and gastrointestinal (for example colon or bowel) cancers, the bowel can become blocked or obstructed by the original tumour, metastatic deposits or due to the side effects of previous treatments. The decision to operate on patients with bowel obstruction who are already very unwell because of their advanced cancer is difficult. Often, these people develop bowel obstruction as a sign that the cancer is progressing and they are in the process of dying. When the bowel obstructs in this situation, surgery might be useful for some patients, it might make no difference to how long the patient has to live, or it might make the situation worse due to the complications of surgery. When time is short, managing symptoms and maximising comfort for the patient is the priority. Different surgical teams adopt different approaches. We wanted to establish the evidence for the benefit and harm of surgery in these situations and therefore help patients and doctors make good decisions. 
Key findings and quality of the evidence 
We first looked at the evidence in 2000 and this is an update of the original review. In total we found 43 studies examining 4265 people. We looked at adults with advanced gynaecological or gastrointestinal cancer who developed bowel obstruction and had either surgical or non‐surgical treatment. The studies we found were of low quality and measured success and benefit in different ways. It was therefore not possible to compare these studies and conclude whether surgery was of benefit or harm in this situation. Research in this area is problematic and the type of study needed to answer this question would be very difficult to conduct.
