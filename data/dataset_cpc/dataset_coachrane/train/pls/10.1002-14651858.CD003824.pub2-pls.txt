Thiazide diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure
Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs commonly recommended as first‐line treatment for raised blood pressure because they significantly reduce death, stroke and heart attacks. This class includes bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and metolazone. We asked by how much does this class of drugs lower blood pressure and whether there is a difference between individual drugs within the class. We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had assessed this question. The data included in this review was up to date as of February 2014. 
We found 60 trials that randomly assigned 11,282 adult participants, mean age 55 years, 53% male and 47% female, with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg (mean blood pressure 158/99 mmHg) to take one of six thiazide diuretics or placebo for an average duration of eight weeks. Most of the trials (82%) were published before the year 2000 and most were found to have a high risk of bias in the adverse effect data. Co‐morbidities were not reported in most trials. The blood pressure‐lowering effect was modest. Thiazide diuretics reduced blood pressure by 9 points in the upper number (called systolic blood pressure) and 4 points in the lower number (called diastolic blood pressure). Different thiazide drugs have similar effects in lowering blood pressure and thiazides lower systolic blood pressure more than other classes of antihypertensive drugs. 
This review could not provide a valid estimate of short‐term harms from all thiazide diuretics because there was incomplete reporting of metabolic effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, low‐density cholesterol and triglycerides) and the number of participants who dropped out of the trials due to adverse drug effects.
