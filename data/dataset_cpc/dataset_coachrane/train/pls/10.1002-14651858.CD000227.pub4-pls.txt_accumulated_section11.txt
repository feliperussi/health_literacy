Vitamin D and related vitamin D compounds for preventing fractures resulting from osteoporosis in older people 
Why do older people suffer bone fractures? 
Hip fractures and several other types of fractures are very common in post‐menopausal women and older men due to age‐related weakening of their bones (osteoporosis). 
What is the impact of bone fractures in older people? 
Fractures due to osteoporosis often occur in the hip, wrist or spine and can lead to considerable disability or even death. Those who survive often have reduced mobility and may require greater social and nursing care. 
Why might vitamin D help? 
Vitamin D is necessary for building strong bone. Older people often have low vitamin D levels because of lack of exposure to sunlight and low consumption of vitamin D in their diet. Therefore, it has been suggested that taking additional vitamin D in the form of supplements may help to reduce the risk of fractures of the hip and other bones. 
Purpose of this review 
To investigate the effects of vitamin D or vitamin D‐related supplements, taken with or without calcium supplements, for preventing fractures in post‐menopausal women and older men. 
Conduct of this review 
The review authors searched the medical literature up to December 2012, and identified 53 relevant medical trials, with a total of 91,791 people taking part. The trials reported fracture outcomes in postmenopausal women or men aged over 65 years from community, hospital and nursing‐home settings. These trials compared vitamin D or related supplements with – or without ‐ calcium supplements, against fake supplements (placebo), no supplement or calcium supplements alone.
