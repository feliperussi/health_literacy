Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) for treating long‐term constipation in children. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of TES in improving constipation in children. 
Background 
Childhood constipation is a common problem with substantial health, economic and emotional burdens. Currently, most treatment options include the use of laxatives with diet modification. None of the common medications used are found to be consistently effective, and there are concerns regarding side effects and dependence, especially following long‐term use of laxatives. TES is a newer, non‐pharmacological mode of treatment that involves placing the electrodes on the belly of affected children, which generates small electrical wave forms (interferential current) across the belly wall in a dose that is well below a level that may cause concern, aiming to stimulate the bowel to improve bowel motion.

We included research evidence that was current to July 2015.
Study characteristics 
We included a single study with 11 reports that focused on results for different outcomes. The participants of the included study were 46 children aged 8 to 18 years recruited from the clinic of a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia who were diagnosed with long‐term constipation either based on their symptoms and/or X‐ray studies. The studies divided the patients into two groups, one receiving the actual TES , with electrodes placed on their belly and electrical current running, and the other receiving sham stimulation, with identical device administered but without the electrical current. The participants were followed‐up for up to four years, although only outcome information up until the follow‐up period of two months were available in this review. 
Source of funding 
The study was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and Murdoch Children's Research Institute Theme Investment Grants.
