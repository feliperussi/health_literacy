Fetal measurements for guiding the medical management of women with diabetes in pregnancy to improve outcomes for mother and baby 
What is the issue? 
Diabetes during pregnancy affects between one and three in ten pregnant women (10% to 30%), and is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The baby may grow to a large size, leading to injury of the baby during birth, or the need for caesarean delivery. It is known that carefully controlling the mother's blood glucose levels during pregnancy reduces the risk of these and other adverse outcomes. All women with diabetes during pregnancy have their glucose levels closely monitored, and are treated using dietary changes, exercise or medications such as insulin or oral medication, even when their babies are not showing signs of being affected. 
The most common sign of being affected by high glucose and insulin levels is a baby who is larger than expected, and so at risk of macrosomia (weighing more than 4000 g at birth). 
Why is this important? 
Only 14% to 22% of women with diabetes during pregnancy have macrosomic babies (babies weighing more than 4000 g at birth). At present, all women with diabetes during pregnancy, even those whose babies are not showing signs of being larger, are closely monitored. This costs time and money for both the women and the health services. If we are able to prove that targeting intensive monitoring and treatment to those women whose unborn babies are affected by overgrowth does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes, we may be able to save time, resources and anxiety.
