Healthcare strategies for identifying possible or definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings 
Background 
One of the most common inherited conditions is familial hypercholesterolaemia, people with this condition have raised cholesterol from birth. This condition can result in the arteries being narrowed by excess cholesterol sticking to their walls and can lead to heart disease at an early age. However, treatment with cholesterol‐lowering tablets markedly reduces this risk. 
As well as raised cholesterol in the blood, family history of heart disease and the presence of fatty lumps under the skin could indicate familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
It is important that community‐based health professionals, such as general practitioners and community pharmacists, can identify those at risk of possible or probable familial hypercholesterolaemia and refer them to a specialist. Specialists can confirm a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia through examination and a genetic test. 
This review explores the impact of these healthcare strategies in primary care and other community settings to systematically identify people with possible and definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Conclusions 
Currently, there is a lack of evidence regarding the most appropriate healthcare strategy to identify possible or definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings. Better‐designed studies, with diagnosis of definite familial hypercholesterolaemia confirmed by genetic tests, are needed to clearly answer this question.
