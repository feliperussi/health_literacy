Computer programmes for sexual health promotion
Sexual health promotion is a major public health challenge. There is huge potential for health promotion via technology such as the Internet, but it is not known whether interventions are effective. An interactive computer‐based intervention provides information, and also offers personalised feedback. We searched databases for studies which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of computer/Internet‐based interventions which aimed to improve sexual health. We included trials of computer‐based interventions delivered to people of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity or nationality. The review evaluated 15 RCTs involving 3917 participants. Results showed that computer‐based interventions have a moderate effect in improving people's knowledge about sexual health in comparison to minimal interventions such as ‘usual practice' or a leaflet. We also found a small effect on safer sex self‐efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action), a small effect on safer‐sex intentions, and also an effect on sexual behaviour (such as condom use for sexual intercourse). We found that computer‐based interventions seem better than face‐to‐face interventions at improving sexual health knowledge, but there were insufficient data to analyse other outcomes. No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in outcomes). Interactive computer‐based interventions for sexual health promotion are feasible in a variety of settings. They are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and they also improve self‐efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour, but more research is needed to establish whether computer‐based interventions can change outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, to understand how interventions might work, and to assess whether they are cost‐effective.
