Home or foster home alternatives to institutional long‐term care for functionally dependent older people 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of home or foster home alternatives to institutional care for older people who depend on others for their care. 
Key messages 
The studies included different participants and healthcare settings, as well as different interventions. Some of the studies were poorly conducted, which means we have to be careful when interpreting our results. 
At present, there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations for home‐based alternatives to institutional long‐term care for frail older people. 
What we studied in the review 
In many countries, frail older adults with different illnesses may receive long‐term care in nursing homes or other institutions. Due to the increasing number of older adults and the costs associated with care homes, other ways of providing care are necessary, including extra care in a person's own home. We assessed studies that provided care at home versus care in an institution. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that took place in five different countries (USA, Taiwan, Sweden, the UK, and Canada). The studies included 16,377 older people thought to be in need of care services. All studies compared some form of home care setting with long‐term institutional care. Most studies involved people with several different conditions, with the exception of one study that only included participants who had a stroke. 
We are uncertain whether long‐term home care compared to nursing home care decreases the risk of mortality or hospital admission as the evidence was very low‐certainty. Likewise, we are uncertain whether the intervention increases physical function or quality of life, as again the evidence was considered to be low‐certainty. We could not find papers that reported adverse health outcomes.
