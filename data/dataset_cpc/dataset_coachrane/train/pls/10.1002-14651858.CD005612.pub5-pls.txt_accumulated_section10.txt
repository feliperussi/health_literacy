Pregabalin add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
This is an update of a review previously published in 2019.
Background 
Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of people in the UK. Approximately 1 in 400 people with epilepsy have seizures that continue despite antiepileptic drug treatment (drug‐resistant epilepsy). A number of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed to treat epilepsy, of which pregabalin is one. Use of pregabalin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs can reduce the frequency of seizures, but has some adverse effects. 
Aim of review 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add‐on antiepileptic drug in treatment‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
This review examined data from eleven trials, including a total of 3949 participants. Study participants were assigned using a random method to take pregabalin, placebo, or another antiepileptic drug in addition to their usual antiepileptic drugs. 
Key results 
Participants taking pregabalin were more than twice as likely to have their seizure frequency reduced by 50% or more during a 12‐week treatment period compared to those taking placebo, and were nearly four times more likely to be completely free of seizures. Pregabalin was shown to be effective across a range of doses (150 mg to 600 mg), with increasing effectiveness at higher doses. There was also an increased likelihood of treatment withdrawal with pregabalin. Side effects associated with pregabalin included ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, headache, nausea and weight gain. When we compared pregabalin to three other antiepileptic drugs (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin), participants taking pregabalin were more likely to achieve a 50% reduction in seizure frequency than those taking lamotrigine. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and levetiracetam or gabapentin as add‐on drugs.
