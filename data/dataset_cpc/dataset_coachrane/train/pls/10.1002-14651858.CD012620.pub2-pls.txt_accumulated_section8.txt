Which long‐acting inhalers are the most effective and safest for people with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
What is COPD and why does a doctor prescribe an inhaler? 
Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is usually caused by smoking or other airway irritants. COPD damages the lungs and causes airways to narrow which makes it difficult to breathe. 
There are two types of inhalers for COPD: rescue and maintenance. A rescue inhaler is short‐ and fast‐acting, and used as needed for quick relief of symptoms, whereas a maintenance inhaler is long‐acting and used on a daily basis to relieve daily symptoms and reduce flare‐ups. The long‐acting inhalers are usually reserved for more advanced COPD. 
Does it matter which long‐acting inhaler is used in people with advanced COPD? 
Commonly used maintenance inhalers are grouped into four different groups: long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABAs); long‐acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs); LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations; and LABA/LAMA combinations. Combination inhalers are usually reserved for individuals whose single‐maintenance inhaler, such as LAMA or LABA fails. There are not many head‐to‐head comparisons to determine which treatment group or individual inhaler is better compared to the others. Preventing severe flare‐ups and hospital admissions is especially important to people with COPD, healthcare providers, policy makers and society. 
How did we answer the question? 
We collected and analysed data from 99 studies, including a total of 101,311 participants with advanced COPD, using a special method called network meta‐analysis, which enabled us to simultaneously compare the four inhaler groups and 28 individual inhalers (4 LABAs, 5 LAMAs, 9 LABA/ICS combinations, and 10 LABA/LAMA combinations).
