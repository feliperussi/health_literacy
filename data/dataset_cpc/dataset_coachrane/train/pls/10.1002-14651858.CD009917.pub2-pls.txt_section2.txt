People with irregularity in heart activity, mechanical heart valves, and clotting disorders are at increased risk of developing blood clots, which could lead to stroke or death. Taking warfarin significantly reduces this risk. However, taking too much warfarin can lead to excessive bleeding, while taking too little reduces its benefit. To monitor this, patients taking warfarin must have regular blood tests to check if their dose of warfarin is stable enough to find the correct balance. There is some evidence that adding a small dose of vitamin K to the warfarin improves this balance. In this review, our primary outcomes were to assess if the addition of low‐dose vitamin K to warfarin had an effect on the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range; the mean within the therapeutic range; or any adverse events, such as thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or mortality. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range. One study was only available in an abbreviated format, so we were unable to interpret the results fully. Nonetheless, it was suggested that the addition of vitamin K had no benefit. A second six‐month study gave a small dose of vitamin K (150 mcg daily) or placebo to participants taking warfarin with existing poor INR control. This study reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage and found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 mcg oral vitamin K significantly improved their anticoagulation control. However, the study was relatively small. Neither study reported any adverse events, such as thromboembolism, haemorrhage, or death. We conclude that further larger, higher quality studies are needed to conclude whether adding vitamin K to warfarin for patients starting or already on warfarin improves their anticoagulation control.
