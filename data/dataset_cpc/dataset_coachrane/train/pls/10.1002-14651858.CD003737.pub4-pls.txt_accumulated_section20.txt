What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
