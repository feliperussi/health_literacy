Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease
Review question  To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation in sickle cell disease‐related proliferative retinopathy (development of sight‐threatening complications due to excessive growth of blood vessels in the back of the eye). 
Background  Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder affecting many organs including eyes. The back of the eye (retina) can develop problems due to sickle cell disease. A certain number of people with sickle cell disease develop sight‐threatening complications due to excessive blood vessel growth in the retina which is known as proliferative sickle retinopathy. Laser therapy is used to control the growth of new blood vessels in affected eyes. There are different types and techniques of laser used in treatment. However, it is not known whether these various laser treatments offer advantages compared to no treatment or other interventions with regards to effectiveness and safety.

Study characteristics  We included two randomised trials with 341 eyes of 238 participants comparing laser treatment to no intervention. There were 121 males and 117 females with an age range from 13 to 67 years. The trials employed different types of laser treatment. One trial employed scatter laser treatment in which lasers were applied to the retina near the new blood vessels using argon laser. Another employed feeder vessel laser coagulation in which lasers were applied directly to feeding blood vessels using xenon arc as well as argon laser. Participants were followed up for an average of 21 to 47 months.
