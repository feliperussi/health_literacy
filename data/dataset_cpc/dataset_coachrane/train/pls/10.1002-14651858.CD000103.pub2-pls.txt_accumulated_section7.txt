Haemodilution for acute ischaemic stroke
Question 
We wanted to compare the effectiveness of haemodilution (diluting the blood) treatment, started within 72 hours of stroke onset, versus control or no treatment in people with ischaemic stroke to assess the impact on death or dependence. 
Background 
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms of stroke include face drooping, arm weakness and difficulty with speech. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot that interrupts blood flow to a part of the brain. If blood flow is not restored quickly, the brain cells will die. Haemodilution improves the flow properties of the blood so that, theoretically, oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain is improved and brain cells threatened to die could survive. This treatment reduces brain infarct (the area of dead cells) size in animals with experimental stroke. Haemodilution can be achieved by blood‚Äêletting (removing blood), by giving fluids as an infusion or by a combination of both. The fluids used may be salt solutions but colloid solutions, which consist of large insoluble molecule meant to retain fluid intravascularly, are more effective as haemodilution agents. In many countries, haemodilution has been used in clinical treatment of people with acute stroke since the 1970s. Since then, a large number of clinical studies on haemodilution in acute stroke have been published. The goal of this review was to determine if blood dilution could prevent death in people with stroke due to blood clots. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 21 trials involving 4174 adult, male and female participants with presumed acute ischaemic stroke. The evidence is current to February 2014. Many trials followed participants for at least three to six months. Interventions included isovolaemic regimens (replacing a portion of blood volume with fluid) and hypervolaemic regimens (increasing the total volume of blood by adding fluid) using different types of solutions.
