Oral medication for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes
What is the issue? 
Globally the number of women being diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM is an intolerance to glucose leading to high blood sugars, first recognised during pregnancy and usually resolving after birth. Standard care involves lifestyle advice on diet and exercise. Treatment for some women includes oral anti‐diabetic medications, such as metformin and glibenclamide, which are an alternative to, or can be used alongside, insulin to control the blood sugar. This review aimed to investigate benefits of taking oral medication to treat GDM in pregnant women. Another Cochrane Review compares the effects of insulin with oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapies (Brown 2016). 
Why is this important? 
Women diagnosed with GDM are at a greater risk of experiencing complications such as high blood pressure during pregnancy and at birth. They have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life. The babies of women who have been diagnosed with GDM can be larger than normal and this can cause injuries to the mother and the baby at birth. The birth is more likely to be induced or the baby born by caesarean section. These babies are at risk of developing diabetes as children or young adults. Finding the best medications to treat the women and prevent the complications that are linked to GDM is therefore important. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies on 14 May 2016. We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 1487 mothers and their babies (but only eight trials contributed data to our analyses). The evidence was limited by the quality and number of studies and we advise caution when looking at the results.
