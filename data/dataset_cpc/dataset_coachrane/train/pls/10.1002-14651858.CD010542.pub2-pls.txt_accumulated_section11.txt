Transient elastography for measurement of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease 
Background 
Liver fibrosis is a change in the microscopic structure of the liver because of liver inflammation. After many years of excessive alcohol consumption, liver fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis. Abstaining from alcohol may stop the fibrosis from further progression into significant or severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. The latter lead to complications of underlying diseases, including cancer. 
Measurement of the amount of fibrosis is called staging. There are five stages (F0: no scarring (no fibrosis); F1: minimal scarring; F2: scarring has occurred and extends outside the liver area (significant fibrosis); F3: fibrosis spreading and forming bridges with other fibrotic liver areas (severe fibrosis); F4: cirrhosis or advanced scarring). Cut‐off values may distinguish between the different stages of fibrosis, but in people with alcoholic liver disease, the best cut‐off values have not been determined yet. 
Rationale 
Liver biopsy is where a sample of tissue is taken from the liver using a small needle. It is the standard method of detecting and measuring fibrosis. 
Transient elastography measures stiffening of the liver caused by progressive scarring, but it has not been validated in people with alcoholic liver disease. 
Aims 
To find out how well transient elastography may determine the presence or absence of fibrosis and if it can stage fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. 
Methods 
Using Cochrane methods and searching the literature (August 2014), the review authors obtained results from 14 studies (834 participants), out of which only seven included people with only alcoholic liver disease. Participants underwent both transient elastography (the index test) and liver biopsy (the standard test).
