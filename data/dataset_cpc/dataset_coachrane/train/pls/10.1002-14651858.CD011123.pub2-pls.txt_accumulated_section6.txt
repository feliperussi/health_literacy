Systemic treatments (tablets or injections) taken for metastatic melanoma (expanded from its starting point to other parts of the body) 
Background 
Melanoma is the most dangerous common skin cancer. Early diagnosis offers the best chance of cure. People affected by early stage melanoma represent about 70% to 80% of all those with melanoma and can be treated by surgical removal of the original tumour (known as the primary tumour). However, when a primary melanoma is detected at a later stage, there is a risk of disease spreading to the nearest lymph nodes (glands that are part of the body's immune system) and distant sites, such as the lungs, liver, bone and brain. In this case, systemic chemotherapy (giving drugs that kill cells throughout the body) and biochemotherapy (chemotherapy combined with substances that can improve the immune response, known as immunostimulating cytokines, such as interleukin‐2 and interferon‐alpha) have been the main treatments for over three decades. However, only few people experience spontaneous (i.e. not resulting from therapy) regression of the primary tumour. 
Over the past few years, new classes of drugs have been used with promising results. We aimed to look at how new systemic treatments compare with older therapies, as well as with each other, in terms of survival, acceptability, tumour response, and quality of life. We assessed these outcomes in people with metastatic melanoma (AJCC TNM stage IV). 
Review question 
We aimed to assess the effects of systemic treatments for people with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (melanoma of skin tissue). We searched for relevant trials up to October 2017 and included 122 studies.
