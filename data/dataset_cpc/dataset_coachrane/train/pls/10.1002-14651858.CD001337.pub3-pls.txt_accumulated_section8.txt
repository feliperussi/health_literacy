Umbilical vein injection after childbirth for management of retained placenta
What is the issue? 
The placenta provides nourishment for the baby in the womb (uterus) through the umbilical cord. It usually comes out shortly after the baby. If the placenta remains in the womb (a 'retained placenta'), women have an increased risk of bleeding heavily (haemorrhage), infection, and very occasionally death. Manual removal of the placenta involves a doctor passing their hand through the vagina into the womb to remove the placenta. However, it requires an anaesthetic and can have side effects. Use of medicines injected into the placenta through blood vessels (veins) in the umbilical cord is an attractive alternative to remove the placenta. 
Why is this important? 
The injection of oxytocin (a hormone released from the brain into the blood during labour) solution into the umbilical cord after the cord is cut is a cheap and simple intervention that could be performed to deliver the placenta. It is especially attractive for low‚Äêincome countries where there is not easy access to doctors or an operating theatre. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in June 2020 and combined the data from 24 trials involving 2348 women. 
Injection of a saline (salt) solution made little or no difference in the need for manual removal of placenta in comparison to waiting for spontaneous delivery. There is some evidence that injecting an oxytocin solution into the umbilical vein may be beneficial, but many of the studies are at high risk of bias, the results are inconsistent, and the benefits are seen only in a few outcomes. Small studies suggest there may be some effect of an injection of a prostaglandin (that stimulate contractions of the womb; misoprostol or carboprost) when compared to oxytocin solution. One study comparing a carbetocin (which is similar to oxytocin) solution to oxytocin did not show any difference in the need for manual removal.
