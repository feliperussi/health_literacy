Interventions for managing taste disturbances
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what is the best method for the management of zinc‐deficient/idiopathic (of unknown cause) taste disorders and taste disorders secondary to chronic renal failure in children and adults. 
Key messages 
Giving zinc supplements or acupuncture may have some benefit in treating taste disorders. However, we still need more high‐quality studies to ascertain the role of zinc supplements and acupuncture in treating taste disorders. 
What was studied in the review? 
The sense of taste is essential to the health and psychological well‐being of an individual. Taste disorders can range from lack of taste, to distortion of taste, to reduced ability to taste. Any disorder in taste perception can lead to conditions like malnutrition and consumption of poisonous food substances. The cause may be due to disease, drugs, radiation treatment, or ageing; or it may result from unknown causes. 
Various treatment methods have been used to improve taste sensation. These include the use of zinc compounds, pilocarpine, alpha lipoic acid, transcranial magnetic stimulation, ginkgo biloba and acupuncture. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 10 trials in which a total of 581 subjects received different treatments. Nine trials assessed the benefits of zinc compounds and one trial assessed the effects of acupuncture. We only included studies on taste disorders in this review that were either idiopathic, or resulting from zinc deficiency or chronic renal failure.
