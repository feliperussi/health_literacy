Antibiotics to treat adults with acute laryngitis
Review question  Cochrane authors reviewed the available evidence from randomised controlled trials on the use of antibiotics for adults with acute laryngitis. 
Background  Acute laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx. The most common symptoms are hoarseness, fever, sore throat, postnasal discharge and difficulty in swallowing. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed by physicians or self prescribed. Reasons for over‚Äêprescribing antibiotics in upper respiratory tract infections such as acute laryngitis are varied but they often involve physicians' and patients' attitudes and expectations. 
Study characteristics  This review found three studies involving 351 participants evaluating the effectiveness of different antibiotic therapies in adults with acute laryngitis. The evidence is current to December 2014. 
Quality of the evidence  We ranked the quality of the evidence as low to very low, mainly because many studies had methodological limitations, outcome results were based on limited numbers of trials and the trials included participants that could not be pooled. 
Key results  We found that penicillin V and erythromycin appear to have no benefit in treating acute laryngitis. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. Fusafungine could improve the rates of cured patients at day five. Overall, there is no clear benefit for the primary outcome, which is an objective assessment of voice quality, but some improvements are seen in subjective measures (i.e. cough, hoarseness of voice) that could be important to patients. However, we consider that these modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their cost, adverse effects or negative consequences for antibiotic resistance patterns. The implications for practice are that prescribing antibiotics should not be done in the first instance as they will not objectively improve symptoms
