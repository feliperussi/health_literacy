Prenatal progestogens for preventing preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy
What is the issue? 
More than half of women with a twin pregnancy give birth before the 37th week of pregnancy (preterm), and women expecting triplets are even more likely to have a preterm birth. Infants born preterm are more likely to die or have health problems compared with babies born at term. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and is thought to help to maintain pregnancy. 
Since publication of this new review in Issue 10, 2017, we have now moved one study (El‐Refaie 2016) from included to studies awaiting classification, pending clarification about the study data. 
Why is this important? 
It is not known whether giving progesterone (by injection, orally or by vaginal suppositories or gels) to women with multiple pregnancy during pregnancy is beneficial or harmful to the woman and her babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 1 November 2016 and identified 16 randomised controlled trials involving 4548 women for inclusion in the review. 
In studies where women received progesterone by injection into the muscle compared with placebo (dummy treatment) more women gave birth before the 34th week of pregnancy in the progesterone group (low‐quality evidence). There was no clear difference between the groups in the likelihood of the baby dying before or soon after the birth (low‐quality evidence). No studies reported whether any women died or whether any babies had longer‐term developmental problems or disability. There seems to be little or no difference between women receiving progesterone or placebo for other important outcomes, such as preterm birth before 37 weeks (high‐quality evidence); preterm birth before 28 weeks (moderate‐quality evidence) or infant birthweight less than 2500 grams (moderate‐quality evidence). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials.
