Electric fans for reducing the health effects of heatwaves
Heatwaves are set to become more common and their effects can be devastating. For example, up to 30,000 people may have died because of the heatwave that occurred in Europe during August 2003. One way to try to get relief from the heat is to use an electric fan, but whether this will do more good or harm is uncertain. A fan might help to increase heat loss if the temperature is below 35 °C and the fan is not directly aimed at the person, but, when temperatures are above 35 °C, the fan might actually contribute to heat gain. Excess sweating can also lead to dehydration and other health problems. It is important, therefore, to know about the potential benefits and harms of electric fans when choosing whether to use one. This applies if the decision is about your own use of a fan, but it is also relevant to broader public health decisions, such as whether to give electric fans to groups of people during a heatwave. This is particularly important for people who are considered more vulnerable to the effects of heat, such as older adults who are less able to cool down through sweating or increasing the flow of blood to their skin. 
This Cochrane Review tried to provide some of the answers that would help decision makers. We looked for high quality research that had compared groups of people using fans with groups who didn't use them during a heatwave However, we didn't find any research that met our requirements. We did find some studies which used designs that are less reliable for answering this sort of question, and these had mixed results. Some suggested that fans might reduce health problems, while others suggested that the fans might make things worse.
