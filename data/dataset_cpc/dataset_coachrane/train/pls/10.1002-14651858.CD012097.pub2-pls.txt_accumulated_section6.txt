Two surgical techniques for corneal transplant (replacing the clear part of the eye with donor tissue) 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to compare two different ways of doing corneal transplant surgery: Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages DMEK may result in better vision compared with DSAEK. DMEK may be associated with more complications but these complications do not occur often and can be managed without further surgery. 
What was studied in the review? The cornea is the clear (transparent) front part of the eye. In some conditions, for example, Fuch's endothelial dystrophy, the cells that line the inside of the cornea (endothelium) stop working so well. This can lead to cloudy vision. Doctors can restore vision by doing a corneal transplant which means replacing the corneal tissue with donor tissue. When the endothelium only is replaced this is known as 'Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty' or DMEK. An alternative corneal transplant is to replace the endothelium and the next layer of tissue in the cornea as well. This is known as 'Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty' or DSAEK. 
Cochrane Review authors aimed to find out whether vision is better after DMEK or DSAEK, and how the techniques compare with respect to surgical complications. 
What are the main results of the review? The Cochrane Review authors found four studies. These studies included people who had DSAEK in their first eye to receive a corneal transplant followed by DMEK in their second eye to have a transplant. The studies were from Canada, Germany, India and the USA. None of the studies were supported by sponsors with a commercial interest.
