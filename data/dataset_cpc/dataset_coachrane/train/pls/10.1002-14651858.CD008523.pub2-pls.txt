Pacing for drug‐refractory or drug‐intolerant Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease with an autosomal‐dominant inheritance, which can cause obstruction in the left ventricle outflow tract. This obstruction can lead to a variety of symptoms like dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope and palpitations. The prevalence of HCM in the general population, as determined from echocardiographic studies in the United States, Japan, and China, has ranged from 0.16 to 0.29 percent. Treatment options for HCM ranges from drugs to surgery with each having its own limitations. Active cardiac pacing was suggested as a treatment option in some trials. We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of active pacing in drug‐refractory or drug‐intolerant HCM patients. Five studies (reported in 10 papers) were found to be relevant. However, three of the five studies provided un‐usable data. Thus data from only two studies (reported in seven papers) with 105 participants was included for this review. There was insufficient data to compare results on all‐cause mortality, cost effectiveness, exercise capacity, Quality of life and Peak O2 consumption. There was no difference in exercise capacity when comparing active pacing versus placebo pacing. However left ventricular outflow tract obstruction decreased significantly in the active pacing group compared to placebo. New York Heart Association functional class increased in the active pacing group compared to the placebo group and this was also observed when comparing active pacing versus trancoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy. Interpretation of these data needs to be cautious because existing data is derived from small trials at high risk of bias, which concentrate on physiological measures. Their results are inconclusive. Further large and high quality trials with more appropriate outcomes are warranted.
