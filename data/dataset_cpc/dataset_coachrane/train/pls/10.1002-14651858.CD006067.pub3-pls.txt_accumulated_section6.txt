Fundal pressure during the second stage of labour for improving maternal and fetal outcomes 
What is the issue? 
The second stage of labour is the pushing stage, from when the cervix is fully dilated (to 10 cm) until the baby is born. Fetal distress, failure to progress, maternal exhaustion or a medical condition where prolonged pushing is dangerous, can complicate this stage. Applying fundal pressure by pushing on the mother’s abdomen in the direction of the birth canal is often used to assist spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the length of the second stage and reduce the need for instrumental birth (forceps‐ or vacuum‐assisted) or caesarean section. It is particularly relevant in low‐resource settings where options for operative birth are limited or not available. Manual pressure can be applied each time the woman has a contraction. Alternatively an inflatable belt can be worn which inflates to apply pressure during the contractions. 
This review aimed to answer whether fundal pressure during contractions in the second stage of labour helps women give birth vaginally, and whether it causes any negative consequences for the woman or her unborn baby. 
Why is this important? 
A long labour can sometimes be dangerous for some women and their babies. Sometimes the unborn baby and woman can become exhausted during the labour and birth. In many countries, there are trained professionals who can assist with ventouse, forceps or caesarean sections. However in other countries, these resources are often lacking, and long labours can be life‐threatening. Fundal pressure may help the woman to give birth. It may also possibly increase complications for the baby and mother. There is not a lot of knowledge on this topic, and it is important to know how these techniques might affect the women and their babies.
