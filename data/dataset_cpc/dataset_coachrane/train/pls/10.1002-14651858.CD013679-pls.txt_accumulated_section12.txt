Communicating to pregnant woman and parents through their mobile devices to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health 
Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‚Äêbeing. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services.
