Breathing exercises for asthma
Background 
Asthma is a lung disease. Asthma works in two ways. It that causes the airways to become inflamed (the body's response to injury and infection) and it causes the small tubes of the airways to tighten (called airway obstruction). The tightening of the tubes can happen in response to asthma triggers, such as animal fur or feathers, dust or pollen. 
Asthma is very common worldwide and is a major public health problem due to the high healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation and medication. Breathing exercises have been used to treat people with asthma as a way of controlling the symptoms of asthma without medication. People use various breathing techniques to change their breathing pattern. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out how effective breathing exercises are for adults with asthma. We were most interested to know if breathing exercises improved people's quality of life (our primary outcome), and also if they helped improve asthma symptoms, hyperventilation (over‐breathing), and lung function (our secondary outcomes). 
Key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. This means people were selected at random to try either breathing exercises or a control. We included education about asthma or usual asthma care as the controls. 
We found 22 studies involving 2880 adults with mild to moderate asthma. The studies used different breathing exercises. Fourteen studies used yoga, four studies used breathing retraining, one study used Buteyko method, one study used Buteyko method and pranayama, one study used Papworth method and one study used deep diaphragmatic breathing. Twenty studies compared breathing exercises with normal asthma care and two compared breathing exercises with asthma education. Studies assessed quality of life, asthma symptoms and hyperventilation symptoms, number of acute exacerbations (flare‐ups), lung function (breathing tests), and general practitioner (GP) appointments.
