Combined inhalers versus placebo for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of combined inhalers in people with COPD when compared with placebo. We particularly focused on whether combined inhalers are a good but safe treatment for adults with COPD. 
Background 
COPD is a serious respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. In most cases, it is caused by smoking. COPD is often treated by using inhalers. Currently, three types of inhalers combine a steroid and a 'long‐acting beta2‐agonist' (LABA). Steroids work by reducing inflammation in the airways, and LABA work by relaxing the muscles in the airways and opening them up. Using combined inhalers is more convenient than taking the two drugs separately but is also more expensive. We looked for evidence on whether giving a combined inhaler is better or worse than giving placebo (dummy inhaler). 
Study characteristics 
Nineteen studies involving 10,400 people were included in this review. The studies lasted between 4 and 156 weeks. All of the people included in the studies had COPD of different severity. Both men and women were included, and most of the studies included only adults aged 45 or older. 
All studies compared a combined inhaler with a placebo that was identical in appearance to the combined inhaler, so the people in the trials did not know whether they were taking the drug or the dummy inhaler. Some of the studies included two groups treated with the combined inhaler; one group was getting a higher dose and one group was getting a lower dose.
