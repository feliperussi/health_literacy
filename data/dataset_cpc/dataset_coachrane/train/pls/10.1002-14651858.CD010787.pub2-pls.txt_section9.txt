Within six months, operative success as measured by normal blood calcium levels after operation, was found in 97% of participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group compared with 99% in the bilateral neck exploration group. Five years after the surgery the proportions were 90% in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group compared to 95% in the bilateral neck exploration group. About 17% of participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group reported unwanted events around the time of the operation compared with 34% in the bilateral neck exploration group. These events consisted mostly of symptoms of low calcium levels (such as numbness, tingling cramps) occurring in 14% of the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group and in 27% in the bilateral neck exploration group. A total of 5/133 (4%) participants in the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group experienced vocal cord paralysis compared with 2/128 (2%) participants in the bilateral neck exploration group. Other events included bleeding, fever and infection, which were comparable in both groups. The effect on death from any cause was not explicitly reported. There were no clear differences for health‚Äêrelated quality of life between the treatment groups in two studies. There was a possible treatment benefit for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy compared to bilateral neck exploration in terms of cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 18 minutes less for the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy technique compared with bilateral neck exploration. Four studies reported a switch from minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to bilateral neck exploration during the operation where 24/115 (21%) participants underwent the more extensive surgery.
