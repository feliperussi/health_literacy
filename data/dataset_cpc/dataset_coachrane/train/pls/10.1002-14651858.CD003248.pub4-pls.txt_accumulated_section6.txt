Does delaying cord clamping or using cord milking at birth improve the health of babies born too early? 
What is the issue? 
In this Cochrane Review, we set out to determine if delayed cord clamping or umbilical cord milking improves the health outcomes for babies born before 37 weeks' gestation. These interventions were compared with early cord clamping. 
Why is it important? 
Babies born before 37 weeks, or preterm, have poorer health outcomes than babies born at term, particularly if they are born before 32 weeks. Babies born preterm can experience problems with the functioning of many of their major organs including their lungs, gut and hearts. They have a greater risk of dying or having long‚Äêterm problems such as cerebral palsy. After birth, the babies may need blood transfusions and drugs to strengthen their heart contractions (inotropes) and to raise their blood pressure. It is important to try to find ways of improving the health of these tiny babies. 
Early clamping of the umbilical cord has been standard practice over many years. It allows the baby to be transferred quickly to care from a specialised team of doctors either at the side of the room or in another room. Yet, delayed clamping for half to three or more minutes allows continuing blood flow between the mother and her baby, and this may help the baby to adjust to breathing air. Squeezing blood along the umbilical cord towards the baby (milking the cord), can boost the baby's blood volume, and this may improve the baby's health. We wanted to see if there are any benefits or harms from either waiting to clamp or milking the cord.
