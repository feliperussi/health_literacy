Sulodexide for venous leg ulcers
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of sulodexide on people with venous leg ulcers. 
Background 
Venous leg ulcers are a common, chronic and recurring wound on peopleâ€™s legs. Venous leg ulcers are caused by venous disease, particularly in the elderly. Compression therapy (usually using bandages or stockings) is the first choice of treatment for venous leg ulcers. However, compression therapy is not suitable for some people, and some ulcers remain unhealed with compression. Sulodexide (a medicine which reduces blood clotting) has been studied as a treatment for venous leg ulcers. We wanted to find out if there is good evidence for sulodexide improving venous ulcer healing. 
Study characteristics 
The review includes four studies involving 463 people with venous leg ulcers aged between 42 and 93 years old. The studies compared sulodexide used in combination with local treatment (including wound care and compression therapy) with local treatment alone. The duration of the four studies ranged from one month to three months. 
Key results 
Three studies (438 participants) indicated that sulodexide might help to improve ulcer healing, as the proportion of ulcers that were completely healed was increased from 29.8% with local treatment to 49.4% when the participants also received sulodexide. It is unclear whether sulodexide results in more adverse effects (4.4% with sulodexide versus 3.1% without sulodexide). 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of evidence for each outcome varied between low and very low, due to risk of bias, and imprecision (that is, for some outcomes, results from only one, small study were available).
