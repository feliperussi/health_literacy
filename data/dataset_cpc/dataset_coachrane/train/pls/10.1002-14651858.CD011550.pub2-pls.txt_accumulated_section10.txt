The use of standing devices for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What is the effect of using standing devices in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
DMD is a condition that affects only boys. The progressive muscle wasting that occurs with the condition results in decreased walking ability and eventually, use of a wheelchair for mobility. Specialist equipment is used routinely to assist boys with DMD to stand or bear weight. Such equipment includes standing devices (e.g. frames or standing wheelchairs) and orthoses (e.g. braces or splints). We have evidence from other groups of people that standing reduces physical problems, including pain, development of contractures (fixed shortening of muscles) and curvature of the spine. Standing also strengthens bones. However, we have no evidence about the effects of the use of standing frames or orthoses by boys and men with DMD. 
We searched the medical literature for studies that met our inclusion criteria. We required studies to have assessed standing devices for use in DMD compared to no standing device, a different model of standing device, usual care, or an alternative aid to enable weight bearing. Studies had to randomly allocate participants to treatment groups (these studies usually provide the highest quality evidence). 
Key results and quality of evidence 
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria.
Conclusion 
We found no relevant trials eligible for this review to determine the effectiveness of standing devices for boys with DMD. We need further studies to determine whether standing devices have an impact on specific health problems, participation in activities, and quality of life. Future research studies should also focus on the 'dose' of standing (i.e. the duration, frequency and amount of weight bearing) and the use of different orthoses.
