What can individuals do, especially those with long‐term breathing problems, to avoid the effects of air pollution? 
Review questions 
1. What options are there for people with and without long‐term breathing problems to reduce their exposure to outdoor air pollution? 
2. Do these options have any impact on the health of people with long‐term breathing problems? 
Background to the question 
Outdoor air pollution is a major problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 90% of people live in places where air pollution is at harmful levels. It is thought that the average person living in Europe loses one year of life due to poor air quality. 
Air pollution tends to have a bigger effect on people who already have breathing conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Some options to help reduce the effects of air pollution include wearing a mask that filters out pollution when outside, avoiding certain roads with a lot of traffic, or using air pollution alerts. It is not clear how well these options work, and there is also a chance that such options might have unwanted effects or be unpleasant. 
We decided to do this piece of research after meeting a group of people with COPD in London. We asked them to tell us their most important questions about their health. Several group members wanted to know if there was any evidence about what they could do themselves to breathe less air pollution. 
Study identification and selection 
We searched multiple online databases for studies that tried different options, such as masks and air pollution alerts. We looked for studies in any language, published anywhere in the world and at any time, and also unpublished information. Two researchers looked at the lists of studies separately and then agreed on which ones we should include. We carried out our most recent search on 16 October 2020.
