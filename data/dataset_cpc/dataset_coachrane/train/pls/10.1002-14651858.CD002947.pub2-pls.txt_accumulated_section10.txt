Oral herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis
Background: what is osteoarthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints (commonly knees, hips, hands). When joints lose cartilage, bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and limit movement. OA can affect your physical function, particularly your ability to use your joints. 
Herbal medicines are defined as being finished, labelled medicinal products that contain as active ingredients aerial or underground parts of plants or other plant material, or combinations thereof, whether in the crude state or as plant preparations (for example extracts, oils, tinctures). 
Study characteristics 
This summary of an update of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapies consumed orally by people with osteoarthritis. After searching for all relevant studies to August 2013, we included 45 new studies since the last review, giving a total of 49 studies (on 33 herbal interventions) that included 5980 participants, most with mild to moderate symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. Thirty‐three different medicinal plant products were compared with placebo or active intervention controls and many comparisons had single studies only; thus, we have restricted reporting of results here to multiple studies of Boswellia serrata (monoherbal) and avocado‐soyabean unsaponifiables (ASU) (two herb combination) products. 
Key results

Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain):
‐ people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their pain 17 points lower (range 8 to 26 points lower) (17% absolute improvement) at 90 days compared with placebo;
