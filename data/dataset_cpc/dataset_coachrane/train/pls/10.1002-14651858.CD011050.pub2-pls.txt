Do magnesium sulfate infusions reduce the need for hospital admission in children with acute asthma? 
Background 
Many children experience life‚Äêthreatening asthma attacks and require treatment in the hospital emergency department. Some national and international asthma treatment guidelines recommend giving an infusion of a drug called magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) to children having asthma attacks that have not responded well to other treatments. This has been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults, but it is unclear whether it is safe and similarly effective for children. 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies in children that compared an infusion of MgSO4 to a placebo infusion when other treatments had not relieved the attack (usually inhaled bronchodilators, steroids, and sometimes oxygen). These five studies included a total of 182 children. Only three of the studies reported the outcome we were most interested in, which was the need to be admitted to hospital. The studies were published between 1996 and 2000; these were the most current studies we could find when we searched in February 2016. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Fewer children who had an infusion of MgSO4 needed to be admitted to hospital compared with placebo. In fact, for every five children treated with the MgSO4, one admission to hospital was prevented. However, the included studies were small, with only 115 children in the main analysis, and the results did vary, so we cannot be absolutely sure of the benefits and harms. As there were so few studies, we also could not tell whether the reduction in hospital admissions was associated with age, severity of the asthma exacerbation, or whether it made a difference what other treatments were given. There were no reports of harm when the children received MgSO4. The review therefore supports the use of MgSO4 in children, however it must be noted that the evidence for its use is very weak.
