Cooling the brain during surgery to prevent death or severe disability in people with brain aneurysms 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cooling the brain during surgery for brain aneurysms. We found three studies of acceptable quality and analysed the results to see if cooling the brain during open‐skull surgery for brain aneurysms prevents death or severe disability. 
Background 
Intracranial aneurysms are bulges on the cerebral arterial wall. Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is often life‐threatening. People with intracranial aneurysms are classified as good grade or poor grade, based on their clinical manifestations. Surgery is a common option to treat this problem, but it can cause further damage to the brain. Theoretically, cooling the brain reduces its metabolic activity, thus protecting it during an operation. Research on animals supports this theory in general. 
Study characteristics 
The updated evidence is current to August 2015. We found only three appropriate studies with a total of 1158 participants to include. Data primarily came from one high‐quality study with 1000 participants. 
Key results 
Our analysis showed that in good grade patients, it remains possible that cooling the brain during surgery might prevent death or dependency in everyday activities. Very limited information was available for those without bleeding or those with poor grade bleeding. Unfavourable outcomes did not differ between participants with or without hypothermia. The quality of evidence for these outcomes remains unclear because they were reported in a variety of ways. 
Quality of the evidence 
We do not have enough data to be certain about the effect of cooling on death or dependency. The evidence for other outcomes was more uncertain, since we could not combine the data due to variation in the definition and reporting of outcome data. Data in our analyses were primarily from one high quality trial on good grade participants.
