Acupuncture for stroke rehabilitation
Review question 
Acupuncture is a treatment based on ancient Chinese medicine in which fine needles or pressure is applied at certain sites in the body for therapeutic purposes. We wanted to know whether acupuncture is effective in improving the recovery of daily activities, movement, and quality of life in people who had experienced a stroke more than one month previously. 
Background 
Stroke is a major cause of death in the world and can also cause severe disability. Acupuncture is a relatively simple, inexpensive and safe treatment that has been used in China for hundreds of years and is increasingly practiced in some Western countries. However, it remains uncertain whether the existing evidence is sufficiently reliable to recommend the routine use of acupuncture. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 31 studies to July 2015 for inclusion in the review. These included a total of 2257 participants who had had a stroke more than one month previously. They all investigated acupuncture aimed at promoting recovery compared with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture. Outcomes included measures of daily activities (activities of daily living), neurological function, movement, cognition, depression, swallowing, pain, and quality of life. Most of the studies (29/31) were conducted in China; the studies varied considerably with respect to the time of stroke, specific techniques used, and the frequency of acupuncture. 
Key results 
We found some evidence that acupuncture improved activities of daily living and a number of aspects of neurological function. However, these conclusions were based on studies with low quality evidence. No serious side effects were reported and there was no information on the effects of acupuncture on death or the need for institutional care.
