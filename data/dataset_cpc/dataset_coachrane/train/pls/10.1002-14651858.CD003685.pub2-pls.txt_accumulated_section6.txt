Rofecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis
Editor's note: The anti‐inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long‐term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com. 
Does rofecoxib work to treat rheumatoid arthritis and how safe is it?  To answer this question, scientists working with the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group found and analyzed two high quality studies. These studies include over 8700 people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and about 80% were women. Most people received 25 or 50 mg of rofecoxib once a day over 8 weeks or 9 months. These studies provide the best evidence we have today. 
What is rofecoxib (Vioxx)?  Rofecoxib (Vioxx) is often referred to as a 'COX II inhibitor' and is one of the new non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed to decrease pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Other NSAIDS, such as naproxen (Naprosyn) are also prescribed but they come with warnings that they may cause digestive side effects such as ulcers, bleeds and perforations that can be serious. Rofecoxib is thought to be safer on the stomach than other NSAIDS but can be more expensive. 
Rofecoxib was taken off the market at the end of September 2004. A study had shown that people taking rofecoxib to prevent colon cancer had more heart attacks and strokes than people taking a sugar pill. 
How well does it work?  The studies show that more people with RA who took rofecoxib for 8 weeks had relief from their symptoms than people who took a 'sugar pill' or placebo. In fact, people showed a 20% improvement in the number of tender and swollen joints plus a 20% improvement in at least three out of five other measures such as the level of pain they reported, the level of disease activity they described, their ability to do everyday activities, their physical check‐up and their results on blood tests.
