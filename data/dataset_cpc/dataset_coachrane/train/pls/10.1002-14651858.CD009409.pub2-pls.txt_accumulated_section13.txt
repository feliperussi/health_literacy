Periodontal treatment for blood pressure control
Review question 
Can periodontal treatment prevent hypertension or lower the blood pressure of people with hypertension? 
Background 
Periodontitis is a severe form of gingivitis (gum disease) caused by some specific bacteria that are also found in atherosclerotic plaque (a buildup of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in the blood vessels), with the latter exerting significant effects on hypertension (high blood pressure). Multiple studies have shown an association between periodontitis and hypertension. It is important to evaluate whether periodontal treatment can prevent or treat hypertension.

Study characteristics 
We included eight randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 894 participants. The studies looked at the preventive and therapeutic effects of periodontal treatment on changes in blood pressure, with the participants diagnosed with periodontitis of any age and gender with or without hypertension. 
Key results 
Four studies compared periodontal treatment with no treatment in blood pressure changes in people with periodontitis diagnosed with or without other cardiovascular diseases except hypertension. The results showed no difference in blood pressure between the treated and untreated participants for any length of time. 
Three studies compared periodontal treatment with supra‚Äêgingival scaling (by just removing the visible dental calculus with limited treatment effects on periodontitis) in people with chronic periodontitis. The results showed no difference in blood pressure for any length of time. 
Only one study on people with hypertension found a reduction in blood pressure between groups in the short term, with no difference in blood pressure changes for the other comparisons.
