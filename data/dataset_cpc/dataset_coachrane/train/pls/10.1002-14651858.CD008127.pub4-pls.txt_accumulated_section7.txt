Daclizumab, an antibody, as possible alternative therapy to interferon beta in people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
Background 
Monoclonal antibodies such as daclizumab could be a possible alternative immunotherapy to interferon beta treatment in people with multiple sclerosis. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010, and previously updated in 2012. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of daclizumab, alone or combined to other treatments for the improvement in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Study characteristics 
To test the efficacy we measured the disability changes and the proportion of patients who had new relapses, while to test the safety we took into account the number of patients who exhibited any type of adverse events. We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment group) comparing daclizumab, alone or with other treatments versus placebo (a pretend treatment). Patients were aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Evidence is current to May 2013. 
Key results 
We found two studies (funded by Facet Biotech/Biogen Idec and Biogen Idec/AbbVie Biotherapeutics Inc), which met our inclusion criteria, with 851 patients, both male and female, aged 18 to 65 years. The results did not provide sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of daclizumab, and further studies are needed. One study is still ongoing. Daclizumab was generally well‐tolerated, the most frequent adverse events being infections, which were all resolved with standard therapies. In order to have more clear results, the length of follow‐up (where the patients are observed and monitored following treatment) needs to be longer.
