Interventions to prevent silent strokes in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We wanted to determine if there were any safe and effective interventions that prevent silent strokes (also known as silent cerebral infarcts) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). 
Background 
SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy red blood cells, they are also stickier. This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to fewer red blood cells, known as anaemia. Sickled red blood cells can block blood flow in vessels in the brain, leading to a silent stroke. 
Silent strokes are common, occurring in up to 39% of people with SCD by 18 years of age. Two tests have been used to identify children at higher risk of having a first stroke. Transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) measures the speed of blood flowing through arteries in the brain. Children with a high blood flow have an increased risk of stroke. Whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) takes images of the brain to see if there are any small areas of damage called silent strokes. Children with silent strokes have an increased risk of clinical stroke. 
Treatments that have been considered for preventing silent strokes include long‐term red blood cell transfusions, the drug hydroxyurea and stem cell transplantation.
