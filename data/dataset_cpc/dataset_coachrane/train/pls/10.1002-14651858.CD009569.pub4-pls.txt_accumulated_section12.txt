Different gases for insufflation of the abdominal cavity during keyhole abdominal surgery 
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of various gases for insufflation (inflation with gas) of the abdominal (tummy) cavity to allow easier access to organs during laparoscopic (key‐hole) abdominal surgery? 
Background 
Laparoscopic surgery is now widely performed to treat various abdominal diseases. An ideal gas for insufflation of the abdominal cavity, increasing working, and viewing space, should be cheap, colourless, not flammable, inexplosive, easily removed by the body, and completely non‐toxic to participants. Currently, carbon dioxide is the most frequently used gas for this purpose. However, use of carbon dioxide may cause heart or lung complications. So, other gases have been suggested as alternatives to carbon dioxide. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies up to October 2021.
We identified 10 clinical trials with 583 participants, of which three trials (260 participants) compared nitrous oxide (laughing gas) with carbon dioxide, five trials (177 participants) compared helium with carbon dioxide, and one trial (146 participants) compared room air with carbon dioxide. Studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, China, Finland, Iran, and the Netherlands. The mean age of the participants in the trials ranged from 19 to 62 years. 
Study funding sources 
Two of 10 included studies were sponsored by non‐commercial grants. The other eight studies did not report funding sources. 
Key results 
We do not know whether nitrous oxide, helium, and room air are superior, equivalent, or inferior to carbon dioxide in the number of people with heart or lung complications, surgical complications, or serious unwanted events.
