Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that affects many organs (e.g. lung and pancreas). It commonly leads to reduced bone mineral density, known as osteoporosis, which increases the likelihood of fractures. The short‐term and long‐term effects of fractures (e.g. rib and vertebral) may make lung disease worse. Bisphosphonates are drugs that increase bone mineral density by slowing down bone resorption. They are used to treat osteoporosis caused by menopause or the use of corticosteroid drugs. 
The evidence available was limited to six trials with participants who had not undergone lung transplants (total of 203 adults) and one trial with 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation. Bisphosphonates consistently increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip regions. The rates of fractures (vertebral and non‐vertebral) or deaths were not reduced by bisphosphonate therapy. However, this may be related to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials. Severe bone pain and flu‐like symptoms were commonly linked to intravenous bisphosphonates, especially in people not using corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effect of pre‐treatment with corticosteroids. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the stronger drug zoledronate and if corticosteroids lessen or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials are also required to further assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. Trials in larger populations are needed to determine effects on fracture rate and survival.
