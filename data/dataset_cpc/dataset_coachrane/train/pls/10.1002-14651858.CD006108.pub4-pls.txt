Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms
Review question: Is exercise an effective treatment for reducing hot flushes/night sweats in menopausal women with hot flushes? 
Background: Studies suggest that a high proportion of menopausal women will experience hot flushes and night sweats. Hormone therapy is considered to be the most effective treatment for symptoms. However, studies have reported that hormone therapies are potentially associated with some negative health effects; many women are now choosing not to use these and are looking for alternatives. Therefore, it is increasingly important to identify lifestyle modifications that may help to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flushes and night sweats. Review authors from The Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence, which is current to March 2014. 
Study characteristics: Five studies randomly assigned 762 women experiencing hot flushes/night sweats. Three trials and two trials, respectively, were included in pooled comparisons of exercise versus control (n = 454 women) and exercise versus yoga (n = 279 women). One small study (14 women) compared exercise versus hormone therapy. 
Key findings: When exercise was compared with no intervention, no evidence was found of any difference in their effect on hot flushes. One small study suggested that HT is more effective than exercise. Evidence was insufficient to show whether exercise was more effective than yoga. None of the trials found any evidence of differences between groups with respect to adverse effects, but data were very scanty. 
Quality of the evidence: The methodological quality of the studies was variable. We assessed the evidence as of low quality: The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods, inconsistent results and lack of precision.
