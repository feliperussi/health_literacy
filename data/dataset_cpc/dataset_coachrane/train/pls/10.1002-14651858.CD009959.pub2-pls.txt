Interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome
Background 
Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating and ﬂushing of the facial skin when eating, smelling, thinking or even dreaming about food. It usually happens in patients who have undergone surgery to the parotid (salivary) gland. This problem may have an impact on quality of life (for example, restricting normal activity such as eating in public). Many methods are currently used to treat Frey's syndrome, including topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and intradermal (into the skin) injections of botulinum toxin. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these different methods for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We carried out a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention compared to no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Despite extensive searching, we were unable to identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There is no high‐quality evidence to establish which type of treatment is most effective for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. High‐quality clinical trials in this area should be urgently conducted. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo. Subjective (patient) assessment of Frey's syndrome should be one of the outcome measures used. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review is up to date to 28 April 2014.
