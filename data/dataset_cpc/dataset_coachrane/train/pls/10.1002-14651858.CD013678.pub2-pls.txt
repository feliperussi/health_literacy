The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021.
