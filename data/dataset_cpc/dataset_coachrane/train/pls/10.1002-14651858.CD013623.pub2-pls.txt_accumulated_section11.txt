Do beds, mattresses and mattress toppers that apply constant pressure to the skin and are not air‐filled or made of foam prevent pressure ulcers? 
Key messages 
Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether most types of surface that apply constant pressure to the skin and are not air‐filled or made of foam prevent pressure ulcers. 
Lying surgery patients on an operating table with a gel surface that applies constant pressure to the skin and then a hospital bed with a foam surface, rather than using air‐filled surfaces, may increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
Future studies should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‐makers, such as: 
‐ gel surfaces that apply constant pressure to the skin, compared to air‐filled or foam surfaces; and 
‐ whether and when pressure ulcers develop, unwanted effects and costs.
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers are also known as pressure sores or bed sores. They are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. They often occur on bony parts of the body, such as heels, elbows, hips and the bottom of the spine. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
