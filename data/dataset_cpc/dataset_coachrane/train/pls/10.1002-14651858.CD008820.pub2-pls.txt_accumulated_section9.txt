Monoamniotic twins (sharing the same amniotic sac): do they do better if born early?
What is the issue? 
Identical twins who share the same amniotic sac in the uterus are called monoamniotic twins. The amniotic sac is the bag of waters (amniotic fluid) surrounding the baby. Monoamniotic twins are different from the majority of identical twins, who are separated from each other in their own amniotic sac, with their own amniotic fluid. 
Pregnancies with monoamniotic twins are rare – about one in every 10,000 pregnancies is affected, or about 1 per cent of all incidences of identical twins. Monoamniotic twin pregnancies have risks – beyond the risks which apply to all types of twin pregnancy – and these increased risks include the death of both or one of the twins. The higher risks are mostly because the umbilical cords may become compressed, which can be dangerous because these stop the cord from getting oxygen to the baby. 
We wanted to find out if it is better to ensure an earlier birth for monoamniotic twins through induction or caesarean section (‘planned early birth’) before 34 weeks pregnancy, or to wait until later, about 36‐38 weeks (or until labour starts by itself), keeping a close check on the pregnancy and the twins throughout the pregnancy (‘expectant management’). 
Why is this important? 
Monoamniotic twin pregnancies have higher risks than other types of twin pregnancy and these increased risks include the death of both or one of the twins. It could be that making sure the twins are born early – before 34 weeks – reduces the risk of cord compression. However, the effects of preterm birth can be serious, too, and the need for hospital care for some time is almost certain. 
What evidence did we find? 
We looked for randomised controlled trials comparing the outcomes of planned early birth versus expectant management (search date 31 March 2015). We looked for trials in all languages, and with no date restrictions. We did not find any.
