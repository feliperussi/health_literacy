Systemic therapies for preventing or treating aromatase inhibitor‐induced musculoskeletal symptoms in early breast cancer 
What was the aim of this review? 
Hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors is used to treat a type of early breast cancer (hormone‐receptor positive) in women after the menopause. AI cause side effects including joint and muscle pains and stiffness (aromatase inhibitors musculoskeletal symptoms, or so‐called AIMSS), which may cause some women to stop taking their aromatase inhibitors, and potentially worsen survival. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to examine whether systemic therapies (treatments that reach cells throughout the body by travelling through the bloodstream) can prevent or treat AIMSS. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Key messages 
It is very unclear if systemic therapies improve, worsen or make no difference to pain or quality of life for women taking aromatase inhibitors. Most of the evidence was of very low quality. It was very unclear if systemic therapies for AIMSS were safe. 
What did the review study? 
We looked at research studies of systemic therapies, which included medicines, vitamins, and complementary and alternative medicines, to see if these could prevent or treat the joint and muscle pains and stiffness of women taking aromatase inhibitors. We included trials of systemic therapies compared to placebo (dummy treatment), or to standard treatments. Women treated with aromatase inhibitors for early‐stage hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer were included. Most studies were for treatment of AIMSS. 
Outcomes that were studied included changes in pain, stiffness, hand strength (grip strength), safety and side effects of the study treatments, number of women continuing to take their aromatase inhibitors, quality of life for women, how many women developed muscle and joint aches from their aromatase inhibitors, and survival.
