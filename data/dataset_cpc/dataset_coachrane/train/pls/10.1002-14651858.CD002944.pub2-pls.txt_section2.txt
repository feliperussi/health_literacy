Atherosclerosis can cause narrowing and hardening of the main blood vessel supplying the kidneys (renal artery stenosis) resulting in high blood pressure. Even using drugs that lower blood pressure (antihypertensives) atherosclerotic renal artery narrowing tends to progress. Poor blood flow results in a lack of oxygen (renal ischaemia) and loss of kidney function, causing kidney failure. Currently, possible treatments are medical treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs, balloon angioplasty with stent insertion (insertion of a balloon‚Äêlike tube which is inflated to open up the artery followed by insertion of a metal tube which remains in place to try and keep the artery open), and surgery to reconstruct the artery. The review authors identified eight controlled trials in which a total of 2222 adults were randomised to have balloon angioplasty or drug treatment only. The overall quality of the evidence was considered to be moderate because the methodological quality of the studies varied substantially and two of the studies had not provided sufficient data to be able to assess their risk of bias. Overall, the data were insufficient to show that one treatment was better than the other for preventing loss of kidney function or restenosis of the renal artery. Those treated with balloon angioplasty may require fewer antihypertensive drugs or lower doses and experience a slight improvement in diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Balloon angioplasty appears to be safe and there were similar numbers of renal and cardiovascular adverse events in participants treated with either approach. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (collection of blood outside the blood vessel at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), dilated groin artery (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or tear (2.5%) as well as deaths shortly before, during or after the procedure (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.
