Drug treatment of recurrent abdominal pain in children
Review question 
Do medications improve the pain or other symptoms experienced by children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP)? 
Background 
Recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is a term used to describe unexplained episodes of tummy pain for which no cause can be found. The pain is often accompanied by other symptoms, such as diarrhoea or facial pallor. Some researchers have therefore classified different syndromes of unexplained pain according to these other associated symptoms. Recurrent abdominal pain is common in children. It is likely that the underlying cause or trigger differs among children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the scientific literature worldwide up to June 2016 for research studies of drug treatments for children with RAP. We found 16 studies that met our criteria, examining antidepressants, antibiotics, antihistamines, antispasmodics, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and a hormone treatment. Fourteen studies compared drug treatments to a placebo, and two to usual medical care. The trials were carried out in seven countries: seven in the USA, four in Iran, one in the UK, one in Switzerland, one in Turkey, one in Sri Lanka, and one in India. The studies included a total of 1024 children aged between five and 18 years. All children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Follow‐up lasted between two weeks and four months. 
Key results 
This review suggests there is no evidence for the use of medications to improve symptoms or the child's quality of life. Consequently, if medications are prescribed, this should be done within a well‐conducted clinical trial. If a medication is prescribed to a child with RAP, it must be remembered that RAP varies with time, and therefore any improvement or worsening may due to the natural history of the condition rather than a medication response.
