Pulmonary artery catheters for directing management in condition associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy 
Pre‐eclampsia (a condition associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy) or toxaemia affects a significant number of pregnancies and is a major cause of serious illness and even death of mothers and babies during pregnancy and shortly after. Pre‐eclampsia can cause decreased blood flow to the kidneys resulting in kidney failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs and other organs. Managing fluid shifts is, thus, crucial to preventing and managing such complications. The pulmonary artery catheter is one method of monitoring fluid status. The pulmonary artery catheter is a special device placed inside of the pulmonary artery for  measurement of pressures in the different parts of heart, which helps to monitor the fluid balance in the body. Although it seem to be the most reliable method for monitoring of fluid shifts, the placement of pulmonary artery catheters may be associated with the highest risk of complications. No randomised trials involving pulmonary artery catheterisation were found and, thus, there is no robust data to support or disregard the use of this intervention. The complexity of this procedure and the skills needed to perform it may have affected the lack of randomised trials. Nevertheless, fluid management is still an important issue in managing and preventing kidney failure and accumulation of fluid in the lungs and other organs in the context of pre‐eclampsia and pulmonary artery catheterisation is a potential technique for this. We think that further research, especially randomised trials, is needed.
