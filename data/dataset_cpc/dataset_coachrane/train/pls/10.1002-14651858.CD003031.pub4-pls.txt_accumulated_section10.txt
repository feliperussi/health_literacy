Prophylactic drug management for febrile seizures in children
Background 
Seizures occurring with a fever (febrile seizures) in children are common and affect about one in 30 children under the age of six years. On average, one out of three children who have had a febrile seizure will have at least one more. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of drugs to prevent seizures (antiepileptics), drugs to lower temperature (antipyretics), and zinc in children with febrile seizures. 
Objective 
We wanted to know in how many children these drugs would prevent a recurrence of febrile seizures or cause unwanted effects. 
Methods 
We included 32 studies with a total of 4431 children in the review. Children who had had at least one febrile seizure were assigned to one of two or more treatment groups. The studies recorded any further seizures at various time intervals between six months and up to six years of age in each group. Unwanted medication effects were also noted. 
Results 
The study design and evidence quality in the studies of antiepileptic drugs was often low or very low. Poor methods known to lead to obvious risks of bias were used. One issue was with the methods used to assign children to study groups and how random this allocation was. Other issues included whether the parents or doctors, or both, knew which group each child was in or if a treatment was compared to no treatment with no placebo (dummy pill) used. The quality of the trials of antipyretics or zinc was better, with the evidence assessed as moderate to high. 
Zinc therapy was found to provide no benefit. We also found no benefit in treating children just at the time of the fever with either antipyretic drugs or most antiepileptic drugs.
