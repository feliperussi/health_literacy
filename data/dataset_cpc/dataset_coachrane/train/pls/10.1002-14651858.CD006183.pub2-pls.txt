Using antibiotics to reduce infection in babies exposed to meconium
What is the issue? 
ln about 1 out of every 10 pregnancies, babies are exposed to meconium during delivery. Meconium is the baby's first stool. If the baby passes stool before birth, stool containing amniotic fluid can enter the baby's lungs and may cause breathing difficulty while putting the baby at risk for infection and inflammation in the lungs and body. 
Why is this important? 
Infection/inflammation of the lungs can lead to difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen levels, and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been used to prevent infection in babies exposed to meconium during delivery. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched the medical literature for eligible studies through June 2016. We found four studies that compared antibiotics versus placebo for reducing infection among babies born with meconium‐stained amniotic fluid. Two studies were of good quality, and two studies were missing some details regarding study methods. These four studies included 695 babies, who were given various antibiotics or were placed in the control group (no antibiotics). Researchers evaluated several different antibiotic types and treatment lengths. Overall, we found no differences in rate of infection or death between the two groups. We graded the evidence as low quality owing to a poor quality study design and the small number of included babies. 
What does this mean? 
We are uncertain as to whether antibiotics have an important effect on infection in babies exposed to meconium‐stained amniotic fluid. Our results are imprecise, and more studies are needed to determine the role of antibiotics in this situation.
