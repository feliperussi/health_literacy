Discharge planning from hospital
What is the aim of this review 
The aim of this review was to find out if discharge planning that is tailored to an individual improves the quality of health care delivered by reducing delayed discharge from hospital, reducing transfer back to hospital and improving patients' health status. We also wanted to know how much the intervention cost. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. This is the fifth update of the original review. 
Key messages 
When people leave hospital with a personalised discharge plan there is probably a small reduction in length of stay, they are probably slightly less likely to be admitted to hospital after their discharge from hospital. There is little evidence on the impact on patient health status, patient satisfaction with the care received. The cost of discharge planning is uncertain. 
What was studied in the review 
Discharge planning is the development of a personalised plan that assesses a patient's health and social care needs prior to them leaving hospital, to support the timely transition between hospital and home or another setting and improve the organisation of post‐discharge services. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 33 trials that compared personalised discharge plans versus standard discharge care. This review indicates that a personalised discharge plan probably leads to a very small reduction in hospital length of stay and probably slightly reduces readmission rates for people who were admitted to hospital with a medical condition, and may increase patient satisfaction. There is little evidence on health status, or the cost of discharge planning to the health service.
