Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to the blocking of large arteries. Patients with peripheral arterial disease as a result of narrowing of the arteries in the legs may present with cramping pain in the legs or buttocks on walking; this is also known as intermittent claudication (IC). This group of patients are at high risk of a heart attack, stroke and death. Treatment often involves stopping cigarette smoking and the optimising of other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Another treatment often used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with IC is antiplatelet treatment. Antiplatelets make the blood less sticky and therefore block the formation of blood clots, thereby preventing blockages in arteries which can cause heart attacks and strokes. Antiplatelet treatments include drugs such as aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole, but there is limited evidence to date on the benefits of antiplatelet therapy in patients with IC. Twelve studies with a total of 12,168 patients were included in this review. The analyses show that, in patients with IC, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of death from all causes, and from heart attack and stroke combined when compared with placebo. When aspirin was compared with other antiplatelet agents, there was some evidence that the alternative antiplatelet had a more beneficial effect in reducing all cause mortality or of suffering a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke. However, this was based on only two trials. Antiplatelet usage, however, does increase the risk of indigestion and may also increase risk of major bleeding events. Despite its widespread use, the evidence for first line use of aspirin in patients with IC is weak and further research is required to determine whether aspirin would be better replaced by a different class of antiplatelet agent which has a greater beneficial effect with fewer side‚Äêeffects.
