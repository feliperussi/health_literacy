Primary cryotherapy for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer
Review question 
How does freezing of the prostate gland (cryotherapy) compare to other treatments in men with prostate cancer who have not been treated before? 
Background 
Prostate cancer is commonly treated with surgery or radiation if it has not yet spread to other organs. These treatments can have serious side‚Äêeffects. Freezing of the prostate is another way to treat prostate cancer. This can be done by freezing the whole prostate (whole gland cryotherapy) or only the part of the prostate where the main cancer is (focal cryotherapy). We do not understand well how freezing of the prostate compares to other treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for evidence from trials up to 6 March 2018. We found two randomised trials that compared freezing of the whole prostate to radiation treatment. These included 307 randomised men with prostate cancer (cryotherapy 154 men, radiation 153 men). Their average age was around 70 years. These studies followed men for eight to nine years after treatment. We did not find any studies that compared freezing the prostate to surgery. Also, we did not find randomised trials that compared freezing of parts of the prostate (focal cryotherapy) to radiation, surgery or no treatment. 
Key results 
We are uncertain of the effects of freezing of the whole prostate compared to radiation treatment on the time to death from prostate cancer, quality of life for urinary, bowel, and sexual function and serious unwanted treatment reactions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes meaning that the real effect of whole gland cryotherapy may differ a lot from the findings in this review. Further research is very likely to change these findings.
