Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities.
