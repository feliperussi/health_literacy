Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm (normal heartbeat) after reversing atrial fibrillation (correcting an irregular heartbeat) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antiarrhythmic medicines on mortality (death), stroke, side effects that cause people to stop taking the medicine and recurrences of irregular heartbeat, in people who had recovered normal heart rhythm after having atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat). 
Background 
Atrial fibrillation is a disease where the heart rhythm is irregular (called arrhythmia) and often, but not always, too fast. Atrial fibrillation may produce complications, either in the heart (heart failure, fainting) or in other organs by causing embolisms. Embolisms are blood clots that form in the cavities of the heart which may then travel to other places, for example the brain. 
Atrial fibrillation can be reverted, restoring normal heart rhythm, by using medicines or a controlled electrical shock. However, a major problem is that atrial fibrillation frequently recurs. A variety of medicines have been used to avoid these recurrences and keep the normal heart rhythm. 
Study characteristics 
This is an update of a review previously published in 2006, 2012 and 2015, and includes results of a search for new studies in January 2019. We found 59 studies testing various antiarrhythmic drugs and involving 20,981 participants. The average age of participants was 65 years. The most frequent diseases were hypertension (high blood pressure) and diseases of the arteries and valves of the heart. We found studies for nine medicines: quinidine, disopyramide, propafenone, flecainide, metoprolol, amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone and sotalol.
