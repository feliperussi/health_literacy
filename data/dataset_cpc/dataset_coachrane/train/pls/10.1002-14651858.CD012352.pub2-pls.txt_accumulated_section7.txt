Screening for malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer)
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of screening for malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in people who were not suspected of having this cancer i.e. people with no suspicious mole or lesion (an area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin), compared with no screening. We included any type of screening (e.g. skin self‐examination, or by health professional) of any person not suspected of having malignant melanoma, irrelevant of age or gender. We included studies in people thought to have a high risk of developing malignant melanoma, but not those known to previously have had melanoma. 
Background 
Malignant melanoma is a skin tumour that can cause death by spreading to other parts of the body; the number of tumours is rising, while in many countries the risk of dying from the disease has not increased in a similar way. Screening for malignant melanoma is performed by visual self‐examination of the skin, or visual inspection by a doctor or other health professional. Screening has the potential to reduce deaths from melanoma. However, there are also potential harms from screening people without symptoms of melanoma, such as finding melanomas that would never have caused symptoms if they had remained undetected (i.e. overdiagnosis), unnecessary surgery, and possible psychological stress. It is important to establish the evidence base for screening. 
Study characteristics 
Two studies met our inclusion criteria. The first study, based in the US, aimed to investigate how to increase the frequency people undertake skin self‐examinations. All 1356 participants were asked to complete follow‐up telephone interviews at 2, 6, and 12 months after randomisation. The average age of participants was 53.2 years; 41.7% were men.
