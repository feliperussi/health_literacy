Can brief interventions delivered in schools reduce substance use among adolescents?
Review question: We reviewed evidence on the effects of brief school‐based interventions for substance use and substance‐related problem behaviours among adolescents. We found six studies. 
Background: Adolescents worldwide are known to use both legal and illegal substances, which can lead to other problems. These high rates of substance use are concerning, as early initiation of substance use is a risk factor for substance use disorders in later life, and alcohol and illegal drugs have been associated with years lost due to disability among youth aged 10 to 24 years. 
We wanted to learn whether brief school‐based interventions had an effect on substance misuse in adolescents. Brief interventions are short programmes that aim to help reduce or stop substance use. This review updates a previous review published in 2014. 
Search date: The evidence is current to February 2015. 
Study characteristics: We included six studies in this review, with 1176 adolescents overall. The mean age of adolescents was 16.9 years. We were interested in studies with short‐, medium‐, and long‐term follow‐up periods to assess whether any effects were due to the brief intervention. The studies compared brief intervention programmes with two major kinds of comparison or control groups: 1) an information provision only (general health promotion materials and harm reduction information) group and 2) an assessment‐only group, where adolescents received no intervention but were evaluated on substance use and other behaviour at follow‐up appointments at different time periods following delivery of the intervention. Three studies with 732 adolescents compared brief interventions with information provision only, while the other three, with 444 adolescents, compared brief interventions with assessment only.
