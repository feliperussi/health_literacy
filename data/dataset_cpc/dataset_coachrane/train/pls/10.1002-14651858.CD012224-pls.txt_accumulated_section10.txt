Manual therapy and exercise for rotator cuff disease
Background 
Rotator cuff disease is a common cause of shoulder pain. People with rotator cuff disease often describe their pain as being worse at night and exacerbated by movement in specific directions including overhead activity. It is often associated with loss of function and some people describe weakness. 
Manual therapy comprises movement of the joints and other structures by a healthcare professional (e.g. physiotherapist). Exercise includes any purposeful movement of a joint, muscle contraction or prescribed activity. The aims of both treatments are to relieve pain, increase strength and joint range, and improve function. 
Study characteristics 
This summary of an updated Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise compared with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention in people with rotator cuff disease. After searching for all relevant studies published up to March 2015, we included 60 trials (3620 participants), however only 10 looked at manual therapy and exercise in combination. Among the included participants, 52% were women, average age was 51 years and average duration of the condition was 11 months. The average duration of manual therapy and exercise interventions was six weeks. 
Key results: one trial of manual therapy and exercise compared with placebo (inactive ultrasound therapy) for 10 weeks in people with chronic rotator cuff disease 
Overall pain (higher scores mean more improvement in pain reduction) 
People who had manual therapy and exercise had improvements in pain that were little or no different to people who had placebo. Improvement in pain was 6.8 points more (ranging from 0.7 points less to 14.3 points more) at 22 weeks (7% absolute improvement). 
People who had manual therapy and exercise rated their change in pain score as 24.8 points on a scale of 0 to 100 points.
