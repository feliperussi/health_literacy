Swallowing therapy for difficulties with swallowing in stroke survivors who have had a recent stroke 
Question 
We wanted to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for stroke survivors with dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). We looked at swallowing therapy in survivors up to six months after stroke. 
Background 
Stroke often results in difficulty swallowing. This can lead to choking, chest infections, poorer quality of life, longer hospital stay, and increased risk of death or discharge to a care home. Therapy to improve swallowing aims to speed up recovery of swallowing function and reduce these risks. 
Study characteristics 
This is an update of the review originally published in 1999 and previously updated in 2012. We have now included a total of 41 studies (2660 participants), and the evidence is current to June 2018. Swallowing therapy comprises several different treatment types, and we looked at eight of these: acupuncture (11 studies), behavioural interventions (nine studies), drug therapy (three studies), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES; six studies), pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES; four studies), physical stimulation (three studies), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; two studies), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; nine studies). 
Key results 
Swallowing therapy did not result in less death or disability among stroke survivors, nor did it lead to a safer swallow after treatment. However, some individual swallowing therapies seemed to reduce hospital length of stay, lessen the chance of getting a chest infection or pneumonia, or improve swallowing ability and recovery from swallowing problems. Many of the swallowing therapies involved different methods of delivery, so it is still not clear which approach is most effective for each type of therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was generally very low, low, or moderate. Additional high‚Äêquality studies are needed.
