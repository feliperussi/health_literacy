How accurate are tests to measure the level of ferritin (a protein that stores iron) in the blood at diagnosing iron deficiency and overload? 
Key messages 
‐ Tests that measure the level of ferritin in the blood may be reasonably accurate for diagnosing iron deficiency (low iron levels) in people: 
‐ seeking medical care; and
‐ whose doctors suspect iron deficiency.
‐ The accuracy of ferritin blood tests for diagnosing iron overload (high iron levels) is unclear, due to a lack of robust evidence. 
‐ To strengthen the evidence, we need future studies to:
‐ investigate a wider range of populations; and
‐ identify the levels of ferritin in the blood that are the best indicators of iron deficiency and overload. 
Why is it important to diagnose iron deficiency and overload? 
Iron is a mineral found in every cell of the body. It comes from iron‐rich foods like red meat, beans and fortified cereal (to which iron has been added artificially), among others, or from supplements (iron tablets, micronutrient powders, drops or syrups). The body needs iron to make: 
‐ red blood cells; and
‐ haemoglobin, a protein in blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. 
An iron test can show if someone has too little iron (iron deficiency) or too much iron (iron overload). It is important to test iron levels because: 
‐ iron deficiency can cause anaemia (low levels of red blood cells or haemoglobin), tiredness and weakness. It can be a sign that someone has a serious health problem, such as internal bleeding; while 
‐ iron overload can damage the liver, heart and other organs permanently.
What tests can be used to diagnose iron deficiency and overload? 
There are several different tests available to check the level of iron in the body. The most accurate tests involve using a needle to collect a small sample of:
