Using a probe to clear a blockage in a child's tear duct
What is the aim of this review?  Sometimes children are born with a blocked tear duct. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether it is better to immediately clear this blocked tear duct, using a probe, or to wait to see if the blockage clears on it's own. Cochrane review authors collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found two studies. 
Key messages  It is not clear whether immediate probing results in more treatment success than waiting for the blockage to clear on its own. In children with only one eye affected, immediate probing may be more beneficial than waiting. 
What was studied in this review?  In normal newborn eyes, the tear or nasolacrimal duct allows for drainage of tears. Some babies are born with a blockage in the nasolacrimal duct that creates excessive tearing. This condition is known as congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). Although the condition often resolves on its own, children with NLDO have a greater chance of infections in the eye and eyelid. Treatment options for NLDO include regular observation to determine whether the condition resolves on its own, massaging the tear duct (the inner corner of the eye, by the nose), or probing, which involves inserting a probe into the duct to relieve the blockage. Probing is a minor procedure that can be performed with or without anesthesia. While probing may resolve symptoms of NLDO, there are potential complications. The aim of this review is to assess the safety and success of probing to treat congenital NLDO and see if it results in better treatment success than waiting to see if the blockage clears on its own.
