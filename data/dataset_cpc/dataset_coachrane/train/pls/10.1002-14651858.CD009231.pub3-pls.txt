Home‐based end‐of‐life care
What was the aim of this review? 
We systematically reviewed the literature to see if the provision of end‐of‐life home‐based care reduced the likelihood of dying in hospital and what effect this has on patients' and caregivers' satisfaction and health service costs, compared with being admitted to a hospital or hospice. This is the fifth update of the original review. 
Key messages 
People who receive end‐of‐life care at home are more likely to die at home. There were few data on the impact of home‐based end‐of‐life services on family members and lay caregivers. 
What was studied in the review? 
Several countries have invested in health services to provide care at home to people with a terminal illness who wish to die at home. The preferences of the general public and people with a terminal illness seem to support this, as most people indicate that they would prefer to receive end‐of‐life care at home. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We included four trials in our review. We found that people receiving end‐of‐life care at home were more likely to die at home. Admission to hospital while receiving home‐based end‐of‐life care varied between trials. People who received end‐of‐life care at home may have been slightly more satisfied after one month. The impact of home‐based end‐of‐life care on caregivers, healthcare staff and health service costs was uncertain. There were no data on costs to participants and their families. 
How up‐to‐date was this review?
