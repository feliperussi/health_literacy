Drugs to dissolve pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)
Background 
A pulmonary embolus is a potentially fatal blood clot that lodges in the main artery of the lungs, straining the right side of the heart and affecting blood circulation. People with this condition are at risk of new emboli forming (recurrence). In the case of a massive pulmonary embolism, treatment to restore blood flow is urgently required. Heparin thins the blood, but newer drugs that actively break up the clots (thrombolytics) may act more quickly and may be more effective. These newer drugs include streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant tissue‐type plasminogen activator. The major complication of this treatment is bleeding. 
Key results 
We searched the literature and included 21 studies in this update (evidence current to 17 August 2020). These trials involved 2401 adult participants with pulmonary embolism, who were randomly assigned to a thrombolytic agent followed by heparin or heparin alone or heparin plus placebo. No studies compared thrombolytics versus surgical intervention. We were able to use data from 20 clinical trials with a total of 2371 participants. Thrombolytics may lower the likelihood of death and recurrence of blood clots compared to heparin. On the other hand, thrombolytics caused more side effects, including major and minor bleeding events (haemorrhagic events) and haemorrhagic stroke, than heparin alone. Limited information from a number of individual trials show that thrombolytics might be better at improving blood flow through the lungs, heart function, reducing the need for further treatment and time spent in hospital. None of the studies reported on post‐thrombotic syndrome or compared the costs of the different treatments.
