Xiongshao capsule preventing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary heart disease 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the world. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement is the standard nonsurgical treatment for CHD. However, its main limitation is the repeated blocking of blood vessels following a stent procedure. Data from experimental and human studies have suggested that Xiongshao capsule, a Chinese herbal medicine product, may be beneficial in preventing restenosis of blood vessels after a PCI procedure. We systematically reviewed currently available evidence with the goal of performing a reliable assessment of the effects and safety of Xiongshao in repeated blocking of blood vessels after PCI. 
We identified four trials that tested treatments based on Xiongshao capsule. Two trials compared Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine plus placebo; the other two trials compared Xiongshao capsule plus conventional western medicine with the same conventional western medicine alone for preventing restenosis after a PCI procedure in CHD patients. These trials reported that use of Xiongshao capsule caused a significant reduction in the incidence rates of restenosis, recurrence angina pectoris, and serious cardiovascular adverse events with no substantive adverse effects following a PCI procedure. Therefore Xiongshao capsule may represent a choice for the prevention of in‐stent restenosis following a PCI procedure. However, although summary estimates indicate a protective effect of Xiongshao on restenosis, evidence is derived in part from small randomised trials, all conducted in China, with some methodological limitations that undermine the validity of the findings. Additional high‐quality research trials with sufficient sample size are required.
