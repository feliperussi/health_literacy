Restrictive or liberal red blood cell transfusion policies for people with blood cancer
Review question 
To determine the benefit and harm of a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy when compared with a liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy for people diagnosed with a blood cancer (for example leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma) who were receiving intensive treatments for their disease (chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation). 
Background 
People with blood cancers often have anaemia (low haemoglobin level) due to their underlying cancer or its treatment (chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant. Haemoglobin is essential for carrying oxygen around the body. 
A red blood cell transfusion is given to increase the haemoglobin level to prevent symptoms of anaemia occurring, or to treat symptoms of anaemia. The decision to give a red cell transfusion should balance its benefits with its potential risks (e.g. rash, fever, chills, developing breathing problems). These reactions are usually mild and easily treated, severe reactions to red blood cell transfusions are extremely rare. In high‐income countries the likelihood of getting an infection from a red blood cell transfusion is very low, however the risk is much higher in low‐income countries. The need for a red cell transfusion is usually guided by the haemoglobin level. In people with other conditions a transfusion is usually given if the haemoglobin level drops to around 70 g/L to 80 g/L (restrictive transfusion strategy). People with blood cancers may benefit from a higher haemoglobin level (100 g/L to 120g/L, liberal transfusion strategy), they may bleed less and have an improved quality of life. In people undergoing surgery or people who are admitted to intensive care units a restrictive transfusion strategy has been shown to be as safe as, or safer than a liberal transfusion strategy.
