Are communication interventions effective for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder? 
Background 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that is characterised by difficulties with the social aspects of communication, and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive body movements such as hand flapping, sensory sensitivities and circumscribed interests). People with ASD commonly also have language difficulties, and around 25% to 30% of children are unable to use verbal language to communicate or are minimally verbal (use fewer than 30 words). The ability to communicate is a crucial life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of negative consequences such as poorer academic performance, poorer quality of life and behavioural difficulties. Communication interventions generally aim to improve children's ability to communicate either through speech or by supplementing speech with other means (e.g. sign language or pictures). 
What did we look at? 
We searched 18 databases and trials registers in November 2016 and updated the search in November 2017. 
What did our study find? 
We identified two trials involving 154 minimally verbal children who had ASD (aged 32 months to 11 years). The studies randomly divided participants into those that received a communication intervention and a control group that did not receive the intervention but received treatment as usual in the community. Both studies focused primarily on communication outcomes (verbal and non‚Äêverbal). One of the studies also collected information on social communication. Neither study collected information on adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes.
