Interventions for eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what treatments work well to improve eye position and eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury, and when is the best time to use them. 
Key messages The evidence on the benefits and harms of treatments for eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury is currently very low‚Äêcertainty. 
What was studied in this review? Acquired brain injury is any injury that occurs after birth and causes damage to the brain's function. Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes are out of alignment, with one or both eyes turned in, out, up or down. Ocular motility (eye movement) disorders are defects that prevent normal movement of the eyes. Nystagmus is a condition where the eye movements are not steady and, instead, the eyes wobble. Treatment options include eye therapy, glasses, prisms, occlusion, botulinum toxin or surgery, to reduce the deviation or movement of the eyes. Currently there are no clear recommendations on when is best to provide these treatments, how much these treatments cost and whether treatments are of benefit to people with eye alignment and movement disorders occurring after acquired brain injury. 
What are the main results of this review? Cochrane researchers found five relevant studies with a total of 116 participants. One study was from the UK and looked at botulinum toxin compared to observation in people with recent onset sixth nerve palsy. One study from the USA compared eye movement training with sham (false) training in people with mild traumatic brain injury. Three studies took place in Germany or the USA and compared medical drug treatments in people with acquired nystagmus. The review provides:
