Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for children with specific learning disorders
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), compared with placebo or no treatment, on reading, writing or mathematical abilities of children up to 18 years of age who have specific learning disorders. 
Background 
Children with specific learning disorders are those whose abilities in reading, spelling, writing and mathematics are considerably below what is expected for their age, and whose problems are not a result of lower intelligence, inadequate teaching or social deprivation. A child may have a single disorder, such as a reading disorder, or a combined disorder, such as a reading and mathematics disorder. Children may have other problems too, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with a specific learning disorder. 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to be necessary for normal brain development and function. The best known PUFAs are the omega‐3 fatty acids, which include docosahexaenoic acid (commonly known as DHA), but the omega‐6 fatty acids are also well known. Polyunsaturated fatty acids must be obtained from foods or supplements, as the human body cannot make them from other types of fat. Because they are needed for normal brain growth and development, PUFAs might help children with specific learning disorders. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2015.
We found two small studies involving 116 children that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies gave children a combination of omega‐3 and omega‐6 capsules as the intervention for three months. Most of these studies involved boys between 10 and 18 years of age ‐ one was conducted in a school setting, and the other at a specialised clinic. One of the studies was funded by the company that supplied the omega‐3 and omega‐6 supplements.
