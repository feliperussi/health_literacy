Inpatient hospital care compared to outpatient or day care for people with eating disorders 
Why is this review important? 
International clinical practice guidelines recommend that overall, people with eating disorders should receive their treatment in an outpatient setting. Most people also prefer to avoid a hospital admission, as it takes more time and resources. However, it is not known if outpatient care is as effective as more intensive inpatient or partial (day) hospital care, or if it is more acceptable for people. Those who are at medical or psychiatric risk of harm or suicide, and those with anorexia nervosa who are severely underweight or rapidly losing weight may not be safe in an outpatient setting. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
People with lived experience of eating disorders and people who care for them will be interested in this review. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched medical databases and trial registers to find randomised controlled studies that compared inpatient care to partial hospital care or outpatient care, alone or in combination, to July 2018. We included four trials that included 511 people with anorexia nervosa, and one trial of 55 people with bulimia nervosa. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There was not enough evidence from trials to support any one setting for people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorders. There was no clear difference in weight gain for people with anorexia nervosa who were treated in different settings, but they seemed more likely to complete treatment when some or all of it was offered in settings outside the hospital. The evidence was low or very low‚Äêquality, so we are uncertain about these results.
