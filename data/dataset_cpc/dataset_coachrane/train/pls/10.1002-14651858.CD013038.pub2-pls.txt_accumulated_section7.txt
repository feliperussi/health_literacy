Exposure to the smell and taste of milk to accelerate feeding in preterm infants
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence available from clinical studies to find out about exposing infants born early (preterm) to the smell and taste of milk with feedings given by a tube which goes through the nose or mouth into the stomach. We compared this with not exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds, to see which approach would decrease the time required to achieve full sucking feeds, without causing side effects. 
Background 
Preterm infants often need to be fed via a thin tube inserted through the mouth or nose into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric) until they are able to suck all of their feeds. Initially, only small volumes of milk are given, and this is gradually increased depending on how well feeds are tolerated. Infants who are fed by tube may not experience the smell and taste of milk because the milk is placed directly into the stomach. Smell and taste have a significant role in assisting with digestion and absorption of food. Therefore, providing some milk for the infant to smell and to taste when milk is given via an orogastric or nasogastric tube could potentially help them tolerate greater volumes of milk more quickly. 
Study characteristics 
In a search up to 1 June 2018, we identified three completed studies involving 161 preterm infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a tertiary hospital. One study involved 51 preterm infants, and each infant had an equal chance of being chosen to receive either treatment (a randomised controlled trial). One study involved 80 preterm infants who were sequentially assigned to control and treatment groups (a quasi‚Äêrandomised trial). One study was a prospective randomised trial involving 30 infants, but the way it was reported meant there was not enough information for us to include in our analyses.
