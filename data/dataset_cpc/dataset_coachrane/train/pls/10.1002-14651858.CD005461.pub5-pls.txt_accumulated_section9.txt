Effect of partograph use on outcomes for women in spontaneous labour at term
What is the issue? 
Does the use of the partograph during spontaneous labour at term improve the health outcomes for women and babies? Do different partograph designs make any difference to the health outcomes for women and babies? 
Why is this important? 
A partograph is usually a pre‐printed form, the aim of which is to provide a pictorial overview of labour progress and to alert health professionals to any problems with the mother or baby. It has been unclear whether a partograph should be used and, if so, which design of partograph is better for women and babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in August 2017 and have now included 11 studies involving 9475 women. Three studies looked at using a partograph versus no partograph, seven studies looked at different partograph designs, and one study looked at using a partograph versus a new labour scale. 
Partograph versus no partograph (3 studies, 1703 women) 
It is uncertain whether using a partograph has any effect on the number of women having a caesarean section or babies born with low Apgar scores (a score which measures the physical condition of the newborn, with a low score indicating poor condition) because the quality of evidence is very low. Using a partograph may make little or no difference to length of labour (low‐quality evidence), or the number of women who receive oxytocin to speed up their labour (moderate‐quality evidence).
