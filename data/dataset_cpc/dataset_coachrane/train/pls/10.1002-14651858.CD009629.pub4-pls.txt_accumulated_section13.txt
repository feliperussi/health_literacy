Bipolar versus monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction 
Review question 
How does surgery using bipolar technology compare with traditional monopolar technology for men with an enlarged prostate causing difficulty with urination? 
Background 
People with an enlarged prostate can experience difficulty passing urine. This occurs because the enlarged prostate compresses the urinary tube from which urine leaves the bladder. One option for treatment of this condition is telescopic surgery, which acts to remove prostate tissue and relieve the blockage. This is traditionally performed using a technology called monopolar TURP (short for 'transurethral resection of the prostate'). In recent times, a technique called bipolar TURP has been developed. This approach uses saline instead of other watery fluids and may put men at lower risk for a problem called TUR syndrome, which is a rare but potentially serious complication caused by fluid absorption, but it is unclear how the two procedures compare overall. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The studies included in this review are those that were available via an electronic database search conducted on 19 March 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for clinical trials up to 19 March 2019. We found 59 randomised trials that compared BTURP with MTURP. These studies included a total of 8924 patients. The longest period of follow‐up for the outcomes of interest was 12 months after treatment. 
Key results 
Compared to MTURP, BTURP probably results in similar reduction in urinary symptoms and bother. 
It probably slightly reduces both the risk of TUR syndrome and the need for blood transfusion. 
Erectile function is probably similar after both procedures, as is the risk of urinary incontinence and the need for a repeat procedure.
