The effectiveness and safety of treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) 
Review question 
Cochrane authors set out to investigate the effectiveness and safety of drug treatments or non‐drug treatments (such as complementary and alternative medicines) for women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush). 
Background 
Thrush of the vaginal/vulvar area is caused by Candida, a form of yeast that is commonly found in the vagina as part of normal flora without causing symptoms. For unknown reasons, Candida can start growing and cause symptoms of vulvovaginal candidiasis (commonly named thrush). Symptoms of vulvovaginal thrush include itching, swelling, and irritation of the vaginal and vulval areas. It is estimated that uncomplicated vulvovaginal thrush affects up to 75% of women at some time during their reproductive years. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) occurs when a woman has four or more fungal infections during a 12‐month period. Up to 5% of women suffer from RVVC. Some doctors advise taking antifungals as a prevention, but there are no clear evidence‐based guidelines. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 23 studies involving 2212 participants between 17 and 67 years old with a diagnosis of RVVC confirmed by a positive test. The studies compared a range of antifungal medicines (taken by mouth or inserted into the vagina), and some complementary or alternative treatments (such as Lactobacillus vaccines or probiotics and special underwear). The studies reported the effects on recurrence of thrush after 6 and 12 months. Only one study reported the number of clinical recurrences at 12 months. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and nine studies did not report their funding source. The evidence is current to October 2021.
