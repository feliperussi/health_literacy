Human milk‐derived fortifier in preterm infants fed with all breast milk
Review question: In preterm infants fed only breast milk, does the use of extra nutrients (to provide extra protein and energy) made from human milk compared to nutrients from cow's milk decrease the chances of illnesses, death or improve growth? 
Background: Preterm infants fed with breast milk need extra energy and protein to support their growth. Hence, nutrients (multi‐nutrient fortifiers) are added to the breast milk. It is not clear if nutrients made from human milk, when compared to nutrients made from cow's milk, decrease the risk of death and other illnesses, and improve growth in preterm infants who are fed only with breast milk. 
Study characteristics: We found one well‐performed study that enrolled 127 infants addressing this question. Evidence is up to date as of 20 September 2018. 
Key results: The use of nutrients made from human milk, when compared with nutrients made from cow's milk, did not reduce the risk of intestinal disease (necrotizing enterocolitis), feeding problems, death, infections, or improve growth in preterm infants fed with breast milk. 
Conclusions: Nutrients made from human milk (multi‐nutrient fortifier), when compared with nutrients made from cow's milk, may not change the occurrence of illnesses or improve the growth in preterm infants fed only with breast milk. This evidence is insufficient to conclude whether nutrient made from human milk (multi‐nutrient fortifier) when provided to preterm infants fed only with breast milk is beneficial or not. More studies are needed to address this important question.
