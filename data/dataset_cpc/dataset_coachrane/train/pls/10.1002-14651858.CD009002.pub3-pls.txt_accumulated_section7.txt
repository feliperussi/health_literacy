Omega‐3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia
Background 
Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‐3 PUFAs) are assumed to have a beneficial effect on the function of the brain. It has been suggested that they might improve or delay decline in memory and ability to carry out everyday tasks in people with dementia. In this review, we investigated randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing omega‐3 PUFAs, given in the form of supplements or enriched diets, with placebo (a pretend treatment) in people with the most common types of dementia. 
Included trials 
We included three trials that investigated 632 people with Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity. We found no trials on other types of dementia. In all trials participants took either placebo or omega‐3 PUFA supplements. The quality of the trials was good. The participants were allocated to the groups randomly. The participants and most of the investigators did not know which treatment was given. 
Results 
When we combined the results of the trials, we found that taking omega‐3 PUFA supplements for six months had no effect on cognition (learning and understanding), everyday functioning, quality of life or mental health. One very small study observed that omega‐3 PUFAs improved cognitively complex daily activities, such as shopping, when taken for a longer period of time. However, the quality of the evidence was only moderate, so this should be confirmed in further trials. Omega‐3 PUFAs also had no effect on ratings of the overall severity of the illness. The trials did not report side effects very well, but none of the studies reported significant harmful effects on health.
