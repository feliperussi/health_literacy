Biologics or tofacitinib alone for people with rheumatoid arthritis who had not improved with traditional disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs 
In people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the joint lining making joints inflamed, swollen, stiff and painful. We looked for trials of biologics (large molecules administered by injection) or tofacitinib (small molecules given by mouth) in people with RA. 
The review shows that in people with RA compared to salt water (placebo) or traditional drugs such as MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy (without MTX/other DMARDs) improves or probably improves signs and symptoms of RA (tender or swollen joints), function and chances of RA remission (disappearance of symptoms). Compared to salt water (placebo) or MTX/other DMARDs, biologic monotherapy may increase slightly or make no difference to the number of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. In the short‐term evidence summarised here, biologic monotherapy does not increase the risk of cancer compared to MTX/other DMARDs. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with RA taking biologic monotherapy 
Monotherapy versus placebo 
RA Symptoms 
29 people out of 100 on biologic monotherapy experienced improvement compared to 6 people out of 100 who were on placebo, that is 23 more people out of 100 (23% absolute improvement). 
Function improvement by Health Assessment Questionnaire 
People who took biologic monotherapy rated that their function improved by 0.46 points on a scale of 0 to 3 compared to 0.14 points by people who took placebo, that is 0.32 points more (11% absolute improvement). 
Remission 
95 people out of 100 had disappearance of all symptoms of their RA compared to 85 people out of 100 who were on placebo, that is 10 more people out of 100 (10% absolute improvement). 
Progression of disease damage as measured on X‐rays (on a scale of 0 to 448) 
No studies provided data on this comparison.
Withdrawal from study due to adverse events 
52 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy withdrew from the study compared to 32 people out of 1000 who were on placebo, that is 20 more people out of 1000 (2% more withdrawals). 
Serious Adverse Events 
92 people out of 1000 who took biologic monotherapy had serious adverse events (most commonly infections) compared to 72 people out of 1000 who were on placebo, that is 20 more people out of 1000 (2% more withdrawals). 
Cancer 
No studies provided data on this comparison.
Monotherapy versus other traditional drugs (MTX/other DMARDs) 
RA Symptoms 
42 people out of 100 who were on biologic monotherapy experienced improvement compared to 29 people out of 100 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 13 more people out of 100 (13% absolute improvement). 
Function improvement by Health Assessment Questionnaire 
People who took biologic monotherapy rated that their function improved by 0.43 points compared to people who took MTX/other DMARDs, whose function improved by 0.16 points on a scale of 0 to 3, that is 0.27 points (9% absolute improvement). 
Remission 
21 people out of 100 had disappearance of all symptoms of their RA compared to 15 people out of 100 who were on MTX/other DMARDs, that is 6 more people out of 100 (6% absolute improvement).
