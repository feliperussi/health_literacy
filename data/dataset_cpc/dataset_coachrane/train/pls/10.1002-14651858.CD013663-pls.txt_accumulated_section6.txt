Mechanical and surgical interventions for treating women with severe bleeding after childbirth 
This review considers evidence from randomised controlled trials on using mechanical and surgical interventions for stopping severe bleeding after giving birth. Other Cochrane Reviews consider the use of drugs that promote blood clotting or contractions of the uterus. 
What is the issue? 
Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) occurs when a mother has excessive vaginal bleeding within 24 hours of giving birth (typically > 500 mL or > 1000 mL). The most common cause of primary PPH is failure of the uterus to contract after birth, and usual care is based on using drugs to reverse this. Other causes include retained placenta, vaginal or cervical tears, and failure of the blood to clot. Surgical and mechanical methods apply direct pressure on blood vessels to reduce uterine blood flow. Pressure can be applied from inside the uterus by inflating a balloon within the uterus. Alternatively, pressure can be applied on the outside surface of the uterus. This can be directly (using a hand), or by passing a stitch through the front and back walls of the uterus to compress the uterine walls together. Blood flow can also be stopped by tying off or blocking the blood vessels that feed the uterus. 
Why is this important? 
PPH is a common cause of maternal death and illness worldwide. Nearly 300,000 pregnant women die annually across the world with approximately 25% of those deaths caused by haemorrhage. It can also lead to the mother having significant long‐term medical and psychological problems.
