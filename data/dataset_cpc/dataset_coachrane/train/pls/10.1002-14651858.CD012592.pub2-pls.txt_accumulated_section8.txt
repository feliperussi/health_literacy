Morphine‐like drugs for cancer pain
Bottom line 
In about 19 of 20 people with moderate to severe pain from cancer, morphine‐like drugs (opioids) can probably reduce pain to mild or no pain within 14 days if they can tolerate the side effects. Most people will have side effects, and about 1 in 10 to 2 in 10 will need to change their treatment because of side effects. 
Background 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Morphine taken by mouth has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. In 1986 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended taking morphine‐like drugs for moderate to severe pain from cancer. A number of different drugs are available, some taken by mouth, but others applied in stick‐on patches. 
Study characteristics 
In this overview of Cochrane Reviews we examined all the evidence on how well morphine‐like drugs worked, mostly when taken by mouth or through a skin patch, how many people had side effects, and how severe or troublesome those side effects were — for example, whether they caused participants to stop taking their medicines. 
In May 2017, we found nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524 participants. The studies were often small, and compared many different preparations. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were often not reported.
