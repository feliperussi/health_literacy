PEP therapy in bronchiectasis
Review question: We reviewed the evidence to identify the effects of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy compared to other airway clearance techniques (ACTs) in people with bronchiectasis. 
Background: People with bronchiectasis have a chronic cough and frequently produce mucus. ACTs assist in the removal of mucus in people with bronchiectasis, with PEP therapy a technique which is commonly prescribed. A previous review suggested that ACTs may be beneficial compared to no treatment, although the strength of this evidence was low. We wanted to discover what the effects were of PEP therapy compared to other ACTs when used by people with bronchiectasis, and whether it provided advantages over other ACTs. 
Study characteristics: Nine studies were included, with a total of 213 people. The average age of participants ranged from 45 to 74 years. Treatment duration ranged from a single session to up to four weeks of treatment. Eight studies examined people who were stable and one study examined people who were experiencing an exacerbation (flare‐up) of bronchiectasis. PEP therapy was compared to a range of ACTs. 
Key results: Two small studies indicated that PEP therapy is as effective as other ACTs at improving quality of life. The duration of hospitalisation when using PEP therapy or other ACTs during a flare‐up was similar. Both PEP therapy and other techniques appear to have a similar effect on the clearance of mucus from the lungs and on lung function. Similiar levels of breathlessness were experienced with PEP therapy and other ACTs. Other outcomes of interest were the rate of hospitalisation but these have not yet been reported. On the basis of this information, the prescription of PEP therapy for people with bronchiectasis is as suitable as any other type of ACT, with no greater advantage of PEP therapy.
