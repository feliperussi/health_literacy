Quinine for muscle cramps
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of quinine on muscle cramps.
Background 
Muscle cramps can occur anywhere and in anyone; however, leg cramps are especially common in older people. Quinine is a medicine which has been used to treat cramps for many years. There is conflicting evidence for its ability to reduce cramps. Quinine can cause serious, even fatal adverse events, especially in overdosage. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes 23 trials, with 1586 participants. The trials compared quinine or quinine‐based medicines against inactive treatment (placebo) or other active treatments. We found no new studies when we searched the medical literature again and updated the review in 2014. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
The risk of bias in the included trials varied considerably. All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but many failed to clearly describe how participants were assigned to treatments. There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death. 
Low or moderate quality evidence shows there is no significant difference when comparing quinine to vitamin E or to a quinine‐vitamin E mixture. There is evidence from one trial that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone. In a single trial there was no significant difference when comparing quinine to xylocaine injections.
