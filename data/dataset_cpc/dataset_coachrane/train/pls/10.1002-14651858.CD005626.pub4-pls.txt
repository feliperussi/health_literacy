Rutosides for prevention of post‐thrombotic syndrome
Background 
Blood clots in the veins of the leg are a common problem and are termed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). One in three patients with a DVT develops a complication known as post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS). This syndrome involves ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and also skin changes. At the current time the main way of preventing PTS is to wear compression stockings. However, it is known that patients frequently find the stocking uncomfortable and would prefer to take an oral medication to prevent the problem. 
Rutosides are a herbal remedy which have been shown to reduce swelling and skin changes in other conditions affecting the veins such as in chronic venous insufficiency. This review aimed to evaluate the existing literature to see if there was evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness of rutosides in preventing PTS following a DVT. We also aimed to investigate whether there were any side effects from the treatment. 
Search methods and selection of studies 
We searched existing databases (current until 21 August 2018) for trials relating to the use of rutosides for the prevention of PTS following DVT. Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion and intended to extract results in line with prescribed criteria. 
Key results and conclusions 
We did not find any trials of rutosides versus an alternative therapy for the prevention of PTS that were suitable for inclusion. We therefore have no evidence to support the use of rutosides in the prevention of PTS and high quality randomised controlled trials are required.
