What is the best way to help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stop smoking? 
Review question 
We wanted to find out the best way to help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to stop smoking. 
Background 
Quitting smoking is the most important treatment for smokers with COPD. Treatments to help this group of people stop smoking can be categorised into behavioural support (such as motivational interviewing) and medication (such as nicotine replacement therapy). Although much research exists looking into what works for 'healthy' smokers, less is known about what is most effective for smokers with COPD. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for studies that included adult men and women who were current smokers and had a diagnosis of COPD. We included studies that assessed the effectiveness of any behavioural support or medication, or both as an aid to quit smoking. We included studies that compared different types of treatment or compared treatment to stop smoking with no treatment or 'usual care'. We only included studies that reported how many people had stopped smoking after at least six months of follow‐up. We carried out the most recent search for studies in March 2016. 
Key results 
We found high‐quality evidence from a collection of four (1,540 participants) of the total 16 included studies (13,123 participants) in this review. Overall, we found evidence that smokers with COPD who receive a combination of high‐intensity behavioural support and medication are more than twice as likely to quit as people who receive behavioural support alone. We found no clear evidence that one particular form of behavioural support or medication is better than another. It is still unclear whether smokers with COPD are different from smokers without COPD with regard to which treatments work best to help them stop smoking.
