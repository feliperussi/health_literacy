How accurate are computerised tomography (CT) scans for detecting liver cancer?
Key messages 
In people with chronic liver disease,
· computerised tomography (CT: cross‐sectional scans inside the body) probably misses liver cancer in 22.5% of people who would not receive timely or appropriate treatment, and also, CT incorrectly finds liver cancer in 8.7% of people who would receive unnecessary treatment. 
· CT probably misses liver cancer in 28.6% of people with liver cancer who could have surgery to remove part of their liver, and CT incorrectly finds liver cancer in 7.7% of people who undergo inappropriate surgery. 
· The studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw firm conclusions based on the evidence. 
Why is it important to diagnose liver cancer accurately? 
Liver cancer, or ‘hepatocellular carcinoma’ occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease, regardless of the cause. It is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the fourth most common cause of death due to cancer. It is difficult to diagnose because early symptoms are similar to those of liver disease. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest liver cancer may go on to have further tests, such as scans that produce images of the liver, or biopsy where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined. If liver cancer is detected early, people may be treated with surgery to remove part of the liver (a liver resection) or with a liver transplant. If the liver cancer is more advanced, people may need chemotherapy. If liver cancer is missed, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing liver cancer when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment.
