What are the benefits and risks of healthcare workers using antimicrobial mouthwashes or nasal sprays to protect themselves when they treat people with COVID‐19? 
Why is this question important? 
COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Most people infected with COVID‐19 develop a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection). Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care. 
COVID‐19 spreads from person to person primarily through droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. A person can also become infected by touching a surface or object that has viral droplets on it, and then touching their own mouth or nose. 
Healthcare workers who treat people with COVID‐19 are at risk of becoming infected themselves. Self‐administered use of an antimicrobial mouthwash (to rinse the mouth) or nasal spray (sprayed into the nose) might help healthcare workers to protect themselves against infection. Antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays are liquids that kill or stop the growth of micro‐organisms such as viruses or bacteria. 
As with any medical treatment, antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays have potential risks as well as benefits. It is possible that using mouthwashes or nasal sprays could cause a variety of unwanted (adverse) effects, including irritation, allergic reactions or loss of smell. They may also remove micro‐organisms from the mouth or nose that are useful for protecting the body against infection. 
To assess the benefits and risks of self‐administered antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays for healthcare workers treating patients with COVID‐19, we set out to review the research evidence.
