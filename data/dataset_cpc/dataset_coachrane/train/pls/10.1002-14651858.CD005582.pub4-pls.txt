Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia
Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful condition that is one of the most common complications of an acute herpes zoster infection. Herpes zoster presents as a localised rash resembling localised chicken pox, often called 'shingles'. Postherpetic neuralgia may persist lifelong once it occurs and has major implications for quality of life and use of healthcare resources. Corticosteroids have a potent anti‐inflammatory action, which it has been suggested might minimise nerve damage and thereby relieve or prevent the pain experienced by people suffering from this condition. Five trials were identified from a systematic search of the literature which were of high enough quality to be included in the review. These trials involved 787 participants in total. We were able to combine the results from two trials (114 participants) and there was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and control groups in the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. Two of the three other included trials reported results at less than one month, so these participants did not fulfil the current criteria for a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia. The last trial reported results in a format unsuitable for meta‐analysis. There were no significant differences in serious or non‐serious adverse events between the corticosteroids and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. It can be concluded that, based on moderate quality evidence, corticosteroids are not effective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.
