Face‐to‐face interventions to inform or educate parents about early childhood vaccination
Review question 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether face‐to‐face information or education delivered to parents or expectant parents improved vaccination status, parental knowledge or understanding of vaccination, attitudes or beliefs about vaccination, or intention to vaccinate. We also looked for evidence about any negative impacts of the intervention, such as anxiety, and evidence about cost and parents’ experiences of the intervention. 
This is an update of a review originally published in 2013. In this update, we found four new studies, for a total of ten studies. 
Background 
Childhood vaccination is an important and effective way to reduce childhood illness and death. However, many children do not receive the recommended vaccines, because their parents or caregivers do not know why vaccination is important, do not understand how, where, or when to get their children vaccinated, or have concerns or doubts about vaccine safety and efficacy. 
One way to inform or educate parents about vaccination is through face‐to‐face discussions, either one‐on‐one, or in groups. This strategy can be used and adapted in any setting. 
Study characteristics 
We included trials published up to July 2017. We found ten studies with a total of 4527 participants that looked at the effects of face‐to‐face information or education for parents. Seven studies were from high‐income countries, and three were from low‐ or middle‐income countries. The interventions were a mix of short (under ten minutes) and longer sessions (15 minutes to several hours) that were delivered to new or expectant parents.
