What are the benefits and risks of giving corticosteroids to pregnant women at risk of premature birth? 
Why is this question important? 
Babies born prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) can have trouble breathing if their lungs are not sufficiently developed. Up to half of babies born before 28 weeks, and a third of babies born before 32 weeks, have problems breathing and many babies do not survive. Others may become disabled due to the lack of oxygen they suffer because of the breathing difficulties experienced at birth.    
Women who may be at risk of giving birth prematurely can be given corticosteroids to prevent their babies from having trouble breathing once they are born. Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammation medicines that help the baby’s lungs mature before being born. They are usually given to women at risk of early labour, typically as two injections, though they can also be given before planned preterm birth and in some cases a repeat course can be given.  
To find out about the benefits and risks of giving corticosteroids to women at risk of giving birth early, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids against: 
‐ a placebo (dummy) treatment; or
‐ no treatment.
We compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies.
