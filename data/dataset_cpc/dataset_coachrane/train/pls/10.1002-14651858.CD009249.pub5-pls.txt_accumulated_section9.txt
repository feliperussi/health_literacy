Antibiotic treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis who were infected with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 
Background 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a bacterium which is resistant to several antibiotics and over the last 10 years it has been found more and more often in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Long‐term infection with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been linked to lung infections. However, at present, it is unclear if people with cystic fibrosis should be treated for this lung infection when it is identified. The purpose of this review is to determine whether treatment with different antibiotic combinations for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia will improve lung function or decrease the frequency of hospital admission in people with cystic fibrosis. We also want to review the effect of treatment of long‐term Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection so as to remove it totally from the lungs of a person with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review.

Trial characteristics 
We did not find any randomized controlled trials (trials where the people taking part are put into different treatment groups completely at random) which we could include in the review. We did find one trial of antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease in the airways) which included people infected with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, but the people in the trial also had infections caused by other bacteria and we were not able to obtain separate data for the different causes of infection.
