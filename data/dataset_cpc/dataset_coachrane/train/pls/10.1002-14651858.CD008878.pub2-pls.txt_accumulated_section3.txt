Analgesia for forceps delivery
Forceps are instruments designed to aid in the delivery of the baby by gripping the head. Many different types of forceps have been developed. Forceps may be used when the baby fails to progress to delivery or to help to shorten labour for the mother when there is a need, for example when the mother is exhausted in the second stage of labour, if there is suspected distress of the fetus, or when the mother has a medical condition such as a cardiac, respiratory or neurologic condition that may prevent her from pushing. A woman who requires forceps to be used to assist her baby's birth needs effective pain relief (analgesia) so that she can remain comfortable to help the doctor perform the procedure safely. 
This review found that there is not enough evidence from the four included randomised controlled trials, involving 388 women and their babies, to determine the most effective and safe analgesic agent or technique for women who are undergoing a forceps delivery. Three of the four trials compared diazepam with alternative agents (ketamine, vinydan‐ether, or "other" anaesthesic agent) to provide general anaesthesia during forceps delivery. A number of different methods were used to measure pain relief and the results could not be combined. The data from one trial could not be included in the review. Women who received diazepam were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women who received vinydan‐ether in one small trial. In another small trial, however, no difference in pain relief was shown when diazepam was compared with ketamine. In the trial that compared spinal analgesia with pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were more likely to report their pain relief as adequate and were less likely to report severe pain. None of the four trials reported on serious complications or death for the mother or baby.
