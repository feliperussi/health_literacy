Treatment of amblyopia (lazy eye) caused by strabismus (squint) with patching or optical treatment (glasses or penalisation) or both 
Review question: Treatment of amblyopia (lazy eye) caused by strabismus (squint) with patching or optical treatment (glasses or penalisation) or both.  Background: Amblyopia is a common childhood condition which causes a reduction in vision of one or both eyes which is not caused by any eye disease. Amblyopia can be caused by the presence of a squint (misalignment of the eyes where one eye may turn inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards). This review aims to look at the treatment of reduced vision caused by the presence of a squint, not the treatment of the squint itself.  Search date: Searches were last run 30 January 2014.  Study characteristics: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the United States were included in this review.  Key results: The results of one of these trials indicate that patching therapy combined with any necessary glasses is more effective than glasses alone in the treatment of this condition. Two of the trials analysed the role of adding near activities to supplement patching therapy. These trials suggest there may be benefit to adding near activities to prescribed occlusion regime. No trial examining the role of optical penalisation (altering glasses strength) or using partial occlusion (frosted lens opposed to a patch) was found. The effectiveness of optical penalisation and partial occlusion for the treatment of strabismic amblyopia is unknown.  Quality of the evidence: The quality of the available evidence is high.
