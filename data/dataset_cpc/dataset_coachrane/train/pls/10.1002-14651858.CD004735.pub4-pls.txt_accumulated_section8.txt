Is it better for the baby to be born immediately or wait for labour to start if the waters break without contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy? 
What is the issue? 
If a pregnant woman's waters break without contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy there are two options: for the baby to be born as soon as possible, or to wait for labour to start naturally. We need to carefully look at the risks and benefits of both options. 
Why is this important? 
Being born too early can increase the chance of problems linked to prematurity, such as breathing difficulties and longer stays in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, staying in the womb may cause infections for both mother and baby that can lead to serious health problems and even death. This review aims to find out which is the best option. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 12 trials that involved 3617 women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. Women were randomly selected to either early birth or expectant management (wait for birth).The women were between 25 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. The studies happened in 16 countries between 1977 and 2013. Overall, the 12 studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias and the evidence was of moderate to high quality. 
We found no difference in the rate of infant infection or infant death before birth between the two groups. However, early birth increased the risk of infant death after birth, as well as breathing problems, with the newborn needing extra help to breathe. The babies of women who had a planned early birth were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care, and were born earlier than babies of women who waited to give birth. Early birth also increased the rate of caesarean section, induction of labour and the risk of infection of the lining of the womb but decreased the risk of infection in the membranes. Women had a longer hospital stay if they were randomised to waiting.
