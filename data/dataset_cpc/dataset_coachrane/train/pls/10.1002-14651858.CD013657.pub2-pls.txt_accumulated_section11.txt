Mental health support in the community for refugee children and adolescents in high‐income countries 
Refugee children and adolescents who have settled in high‐income countries are at risk of mental health problems due to the many challenges they face before, during, and after migration. 
Key message 
The evidence to date is not of sufficient quantity or quality to recommend what interventions should be implemented in practice. It is necessary for existing mental health support programmes and interventions for child refugees and asylum seekers to be evaluated so that they can add to the evidence on what works to support mental health in this population. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to assess the evidence for mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment taking place in the community for refugee children and adolescents living in high‐income countries. Some programmes or interventions may focus on mental health promotion (to improve mental health) through community‐building and social support, while others may focus on the treatment of mental health problems with individualised specialist care. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies in online databases and registries on 23 February 2021. 
Studies of any design were eligible as long as they included child or adolescent refugees aged 18 years or younger and evaluated a community‐based mental health intervention in a high‐income country.  
What did we find? 
We included 38 studies with a wide range of study designs, participant characteristics, and interventions. Three studies used a randomised controlled trial design where the treatments people received were decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. We used these studies to assess the effectiveness of interventions and the acceptability as indicated by the occurrence of adverse events.
