Antibiotics to prevent infection of the brain coverings (meningitis) in patients with basilar skull fracture 
Review question 
Is it beneficial for patients with basilar skull fractures to receive a course of intravenous antibiotics? 
Background 
Basilar skull fracture (7% to 15.8% of all skull fractures) places the central nervous system in contact with bacteria from the nose and throat and may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid leakage (occurring in 2% to 20.8% of patients). Blood or watery discharge from the nose or ears, bruising behind the ear or around the eyes, hearing loss, inability to perceive odours or facial asymmetry may lead physicians to the diagnosis of basilar skull fracture. Patients with a basilar skull fracture may develop meningitis and some doctors give antibiotics in an attempt to reduce this risk. 
Study characteristics 
This review examined five randomised controlled trials, comprising a total of 208 participants with basilar skull fracture, which compared those who received preventive antibiotic therapy with those who did not receive antibiotics, to establish how many participants developed meningitis. The evidence is current to June 2014. 
Key results 
The available data did not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics, as there is no proven benefit of such therapy. There was a possible adverse effect of increased susceptibility to infection with more pathogenic (disease‚Äêcausing) organisms. We suggest that research is needed to address this question, as there are too few studies available on this subject and they have overall design shortcomings and small combined numbers of participants studied. 
Quality of the evidence 
We ranked the evidence as being of moderate quality because it is based on randomised data, although with some methodological limitations in design that caused us to downgrade the quality of the trials.
