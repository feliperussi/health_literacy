Eating nuts to prevent cardiovascular disease
Review question 
This Cochrane review aims to answer the question whether or not eating nuts can prevent cardiovascular disease. 
Background 
Cardiovascular diseases are a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. They are a major cause of death worldwide. The food we eat may influence the risk of getting cardiovascular disease. Nuts, if consumed regularly and at relatively high doses (50 g to 100 g), are believed to reduce total cholesterol and low‚Äêdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (bad cholesterol). 
Study characteristics 
This review includes randomised controlled trials, which lasted at least 12 weeks. Participants were between 37 to 54 years old on average. The evidence is current up to 30 July 2015. 
Key results 
We included five trials (435 participants), one of which had two treatment arms. All five trials investigated the effects of eating nuts. No studies were found which investigated the effect of giving advice to eat more nuts. None of the studies reported on deaths or cardiovascular events. None of the results show a clear effect on total cholesterol levels and blood pressure. One study reported one case of an allergic reaction to nuts. Three studies reported no significant weight gain with increased nut consumption. No other adverse events were reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials are small, with 60 to 100 participants, and have a high level of variation (heterogeneity). Therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Overall we regarded the included trials as being at unclear risk of bias.
