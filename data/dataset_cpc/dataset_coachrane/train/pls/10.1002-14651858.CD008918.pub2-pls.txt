Morphine injections for pain relief after knee arthroscopy
Background 
Knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure on the knee. The surgery is minimally invasive, which means that only a small cut (incision) is needed. An examination, and sometimes treatment, of damage is performed using an arthroscope, which is inserted into the joint through the small incision. Knee arthroscopy is used to assess or treat many orthopaedic (musculoskeletal) conditions, and patients may have pain after surgery. Morphine injected directly into the knee (intra‐articular morphine) to relieve pain has been widely studied, but we do not know how well it works. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
In May 2015, this review identified 28 small, low quality studies involving 2564 participants looking at intra‐articular morphine for pain relief after knee arthroscopy. From 9/20 studies we did not find evidence that intra‐articular morphine given at a dose of 1 mg was better than placebo for pain relief. From the limited evidence available we were unable to determine how intra‐articular morphine compared with morphine injected into the muscle (intra‐muscular morphine). There was also low quality evidence for the effects of 1 mg intra‐articular morphine compared with intra‐articular bupivacaine, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sufentanil, fentanyl and pethidine, so we were unsure which worked best. We were unable to determine how similar the rates of side effects such as nausea and vomiting were between intra‐articular morphine and placebo. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. 
Future research should focus on finding effective analgesics for knee arthroscopy.
