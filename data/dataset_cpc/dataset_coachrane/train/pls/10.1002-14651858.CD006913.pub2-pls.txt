Psychological interventions in inflammatory bowel disease
This review examined the effect of psychological interventions in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) on health related quality of life, emotional state and disease activity. Overall, 21 studies were included in the review, but not all provided sufficient data for the different study questions. All studies were of low methodological quality. Most studies examined combination therapies, often aimed at improving stress management. For example, a therapy might include patient information sessions, training in relaxation techniques and psychotherapy sessions, such as group therapy. Others were restricted to just providing information materials to patients. None of the included studies reported any side effects of psychological interventions. 
In adults, psychotherapy was not effective at 6 and 12 months for all outcomes (quality of life, emotional status/depression and relapse/disease activity), based on 3 studies. There was no difference by type of disease (Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis) or intensity of the therapy. In adolescents, there was a small positive effect for all outcomes (quality of life, coping, depression and anxiety), but only short term effects were reported in this group. Disease activity and relapse rates were not examined in adolescents. In adults, educational interventions were also not effective to improve quality of life and the course of the disease over 1 year, based on 5 studies. 
Generally, at this moment, it can not be recommended that all patients with IBD receive psychotherapy. We assume that adolescents, and patients with special needs (e.g. emotional problems) may benefit from psychological therapy. More research is needed to examine the effect of psychotherapy focusing on the individual psychological situation of IBD patients.
