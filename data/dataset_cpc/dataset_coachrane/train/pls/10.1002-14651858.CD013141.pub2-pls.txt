Early versus late intravenous nutrition in critically ill term and late preterm babies
Review question: to evaluate the benefits and risks of early (within 72 hours of admission) versus late (after 72 hours of admission) commencement of intravenous nutrition in unwell term babies (those born at 37 weeks of pregnancy or more) and late preterm babies (those born between 34 and 37 weeks of pregnancy). 
Background: when very unwell term babies and late preterm babies are unable to tolerate milk feeds due to their illness, it is necessary to give nutrition (such as glucose, amino acids and fat) to these babies via an intravenous drip (a tube that is inserted directly into a vein). Recent studies in sick children and adults suggest that it is better to administer only intravenous glucose initially and to delay giving intravenous amino acids and fat by about a week. 
Study characteristics: this review found two small studies that evaluated the effects of early versus late commencement of intravenous amino acids and fat in full term babies. However, relevant results were available from only one study, with evidence up to date as of 5 April 2019. 
Key results: late commencement of intravenous nutrition resulted in increased survival during hospital stay and in the first 28 days of birth.The timing of intravenous nutrition was not associated with an increased risk of hospital‚Äêacquired blood stream infections, growth and duration of hospital stay. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. However, the quality of the evidence was considered to be low because the sample size was very small and the results were from only one study. 
Conclusions: while there were some benefits of late commencement of intravenous nutrition in term and late preterm babies, the quality of the evidence was low and so our confidence in the results is limited. Further trials are needed which investigate the best time to start intravenous nutrition in unwell newborn babies.
