Oral paracetamol for treatment of acute episodic tension‐type headache in adults
Bottom line 
This review found that few people with two to 14 tension‐type headaches a month get good pain relief from taking paracetamol 1000 mg. There are questions about how studies of this type of headache are conducted. These questions involve the type of people chosen for the studies, and the types of outcomes reported. This limits the usefulness of the results, especially for people who just have an occasional headache. 
Background 
People with frequent episodic tension‐type headache have between two and 14 headaches every month. Tension‐type headache stops people concentrating and working properly, and results in much disability. When headaches do occur, they get better over time, even without treatment. 
Paracetamol is a commonly used painkiller, available without prescription (over the counter) in most parts of the world. The usual dose is 1000 mg (usually two tablets) taken by mouth. 
Study characteristics 
In October 2015, we searched the medical literature and found 23 studies involving 8079 participants looking at paracetamol for frequent episodic tension‐type headache. About 6000 participants were involved in comparisons between paracetamol 1000 mg and placebo (a dummy tablet). Results were usually reported two hours after taking the medicine or placebo. The International Headache Society recommends the outcome of being pain free two hours after taking a medicine, but other outcomes are also suggested. Few studies reported pain free at two hours or other outcomes, so there was limited information to analyse for some outcomes. 
Key results 
The outcome of being pain free at two hours was reported by 24 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg, and in 19 out of 100 people taking placebo, meaning that only 5 in 100 people benefited because of paracetamol 1000 mg (high quality evidence). The outcome of being pain free or having only mild pain at two hours was reported by 59 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg, and in 49 out of 100 people taking placebo (high quality evidence), meaning that only 10 in 100 people benefited because of paracetamol 1000 mg. 
About 10 in 100 people taking paracetamol 1000 mg reported having a side effect, which was the same as with placebo (9 in 100 people) (high quality evidence). Most side effects were mild or moderate in intensity. No side effects were serious. 
We found a very small amount of information comparing paracetamol 500 mg or 650 mg with placebo, and comparing paracetamol 1000 mg with other painkillers. There was no difference between any of these treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate or high for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with placebo, and low or very low for paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg compared with placebo, and for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with other painkillers. High quality evidence means that we are very certain about the results. Low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results.
