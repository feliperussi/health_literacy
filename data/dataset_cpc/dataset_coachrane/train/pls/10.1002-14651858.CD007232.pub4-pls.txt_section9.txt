Combining the results of these studies provides us with evidence that training or exercises aiming to improve sit‐to‐stand performance have beneficial effects compared with usual care, no treatment or an alternative intervention: people who participated in training or exercises got faster at rising to stand and increased the amount of weight that they took through the leg affected by the stroke. There was also some evidence that these beneficial effects were still present several months after the end of training. Sit‐to‐stand training did not seem to affect the number of falls that people had, although the evidence was of poor quality. There was not enough evidence to say what the ideal amount of training or exercise was, but the results do suggest that training three times a week for two to three weeks may be enough to have a beneficial effect. We did not find any evidence of effects on outcomes other than time to sit‐to‐stand or the weight through the affected leg, or any evidence that the length of the training programme or the time since the participants had their stroke made any difference to outcomes. The studies that we found mainly included people who were able to walk and sit‐to‐stand independently at the start of the study, so these results are only relevant to this group of people. In other words, these results are not relevant to people who are unable to sit‐to‐stand independently and further research is needed to investigate the effect of sit‐to‐stand training for these people. The available studies suggest that effective interventions can either be specific repetitive training of sit‐to‐stand or exercise programmes that include repetitive sit‐to‐stand. The evidence is insufficient to reach conclusions relating to the duration or intensity of training.
