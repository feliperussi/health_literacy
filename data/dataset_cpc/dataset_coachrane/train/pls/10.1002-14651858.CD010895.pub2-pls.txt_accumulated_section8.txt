Different types of implants for reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy
Review question 
We assessed the effects of different types of breast implants on short‐term and long‐term surgical complications, cosmetic outcomes, satisfaction with the surgical procedure and the quality of life in women undergoing breast reconstruction following a mastectomy (breast removal). 
Background 
An estimated 28% to 60% of women affected by breast cancer will undergo a mastectomy (i.e. surgical removal of the breast). Following a mastectomy, women can choose from many breast reconstruction options and achieve a natural feel with appropriate size and shape of the breast, according to individual needs. These reconstruction options are also available for the increasing number of women at high risk of developing hereditary breast cancer who undergo risk‐reducing mastectomy. Options include implants that are silicone‐filled (filled with an inert, man‐made polymer in gel form), saline‐filled (a silicone shell, filled with sterile salt water), anatomically shaped or round, textured or smooth, and of fixed‐volume or variable‐volume. We wanted to examine if different types of breast implants are associated with better or worse surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 2015. We conducted a review to compare short‐ and long‐term surgical complications (such as scar tissue forming around the implant and squeezing it ‐ referred to as 'capsular contracture', and 'implant rupture'), cosmetic outcomes, women's postoperative quality of life and satisfaction with different types of breast implants used in breast reconstruction. We found five randomised studies involving 202 women that provided data for five different comparisons: rough versus smooth surface, implant filler materials compared to each other (silicone versus saline, and hydrogel versus saline), anatomical versus round shape, and variable‐ versus fixed‐volume. Four studies included women who received a mastectomy for breast cancer and one study included women who had bilateral mastectomies for preventive purposes. 
The authors of two studies reported that they did not have competing interests; the authors of three studies did not report this information. Three studies reported that their studies received financial support from research foundations; the other studies did not report any information regarding the source of their funding.
