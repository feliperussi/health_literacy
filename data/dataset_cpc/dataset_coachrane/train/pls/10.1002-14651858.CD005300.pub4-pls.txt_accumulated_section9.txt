Specialised antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy with the aim of improving outcomes for babies and mothers 
What is the issue? 
Women carrying more than one baby (multiple pregnancy) are at increased risk of complications which can affect the health of both mother and babies. We asked if 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with multiple pregnancies would improve outcomes for these women and their babies compared with attending standard antenatal clinics. 
Why is this important? 
Babies of multiple pregnancies are more likely to be born too early (preterm birth) and to thus have problems with immature organs e.g. lungs. These babies are also less likely to survive. Women carrying more than one baby are at increased risk of complications like high blood pressure, diabetes and bleeding. So it is important to see if specialised clinics during pregnancy can improve outcomes for these babies and mothers. These specialised clinics might include seeing the same midwife throughout pregnancy, having more antenatal appointments and additional information. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found one small study involving 162 women and their babies (searched date 31 May 2015). The quality of the study was very low to moderate for our outcomes. The study was too small to provide answers to our question as we were most interested in the chance of the babies being born too early, their health and whether they survived. We did find that mothers with multiple pregnancies were more likely to have a caesarean birth if they attended specialised multiple pregnancy clinics. 
What does this mean? 
There is insufficient good quality evidence to support the use of specialised clinics for women with multiple pregnancies. There is an urgent need for more good quality studies to answer this important question.
