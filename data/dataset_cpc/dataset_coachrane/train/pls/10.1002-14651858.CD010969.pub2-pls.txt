Harms of off‐label erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents for critically‐ill people
Bottom line 
Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESAs) are medicines which stimulate red blood cell production. They can be given into a vein or under the skin. They are used in critically‐ill people, despite not being licensed by marketing authorities for this indication (i.e. off‐label). We were unable to find relevant harms associated with these medicines but found beneficial effects on the likelihood of dying, based on low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence. 
Background 
Critically‐ill people frequently suffer from a decrease in the amount of red blood cells or haemoglobin in their blood. If preventive measures do not work, transfusion of donor blood is an effective treatment but it carries known risks including allergic/immunologic reactions, volume and electrolyte overload, and infections. Alternatively, ESAs can be used to stimulate a person' own red blood cell production. However, this needs to be balanced against the risks associated with ESAs, which are not licensed by marketing authorities for most critically‐ill people. 
Study characteristics 
We searched 10 databases for studies where ESAs were used to treat critically‐ill people. The evidence is current to February 2017. We found 53 studies, involving 945,240 participants treated with epoetin‐alfa, epoetin‐beta, and darbepoetin‐alfa or placebo. Five studies are awaiting classification. 
Key results 
Based on mainly low‐quality evidence, we were unable to exclude relevant harms in terms of adverse effects of ESAs. 'Adverse effects' included any adverse events and problems from blood clotting in the veins. However, we found low‐quality evidence for protective effects on the overall risk of dying in critically‐ill people.
