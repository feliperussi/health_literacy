Fetal pulse oximetry for fetal assessment in labour
Using fetal pulse oximetry to assess the baby's well‐being during labour does not change overall caesarean section rates. 
During labour, the well‐being of the baby can be assessed intermittently using a Pinard stethoscope or hand‐held monitor to listen to the heart rate, or continuously using cardiotocography (CTG), sometimes called electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). There are also additional tests that can be used if the baby is thought to be getting short of oxygen, like testing the baby's blood in a sample taken from the baby's head or bottom, or through the recording of the electrical activity of the heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Fetal pulse oximetry measures how much oxygen the baby's blood is carrying. It uses a probe that sits on the baby's head whilst in the uterus and vagina during labour. The probe is said not to interfere with the woman's mobility during labour. This review looked at fetal pulse oximetry and found trials that used it in conjunction with a CTG. We compared the outcomes for this combined oximetry and CTG, with outcomes where only the CTG had been used, or a combination of CTG and fetal ECG had been used. 
The review identified seven trials involving 8013 women. Fetal pulse oximetry plus CTG showed no difference in caesarean section rates overall, nor any difference in the mother's or newborn's health, compared with CTG alone. If there was concern about the baby's well‐being before the fetal pulse oximetry probe was placed, the use of fetal pulse oximetry reduced caesarean sections performed for the baby's well‐being. The one trial of oximetry with CTG compared with CTG and fetal ECG showed an increase in the caesarean rate in the oximetry group. In two of the trials, the company making the fetal pulse oximetry machines provided some funding. A better method than fetal pulse oximetry is needed for checking on the well‐being of the baby during labour.
