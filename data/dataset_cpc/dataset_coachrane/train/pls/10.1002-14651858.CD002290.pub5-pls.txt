Non‐corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications for steroid‐sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children 
What is the issue? Children with nephrotic syndrome lose large amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs. The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems have been lost. Corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but it often happens again (relapse). Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis and high blood pressure. 
What did we do? To find out if there was evidence about non‐corticosteroid drugs for children with nephrotic syndrome, and to assess what the benefits and harms of these drugs were, we analysed 43 studies that enrolled 2541 children. 
What did we find? The studies compared several drugs and found that cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, levamisole and rituximab compared with corticosteroids may reduce the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing steroid‐sensitive nephrotic syndrome. 
Conclusions 
Rituximab may be a valuable additional agent for the treatment of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, where relapses persist despite treatment with other non‐corticosteroid agents. Because studies, directly comparing other medications, are too small to determine whether any agents are more likely to maintain remission than any other, currently the use of levamisole, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, or alkylating agents can be considered for children with relapsing nephrotic syndrome based on family and physician preference. New larger studies are needed that compare different drug treatments to determine how these medicines should be used in children with nephrotic syndrome.
