Immunosuppressive treatment for people with proliferative lupus nephritis
What is the issue? 
In lupus, the body’s immune system for fighting infection attacks different parts of the body, including the kidneys. About half of all people with lupus have kidney problems. An estimated one in every 10 people who have lupus kidney disease (lupus nephritis) can develop kidney failure. The goal of treatment is to protect kidney function and avoid side‐effects. 
While the life expectancy of patients who have lupus has dramatically improved, available treatments can cause serious side effects such as hair loss, serious infection, and infertility. It is important to know about which treatments help to treat lupus while causing the fewest side‐effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 2 March 2018 and we combined all studies testing treatments aimed to control the body’s immune system for lupus nephritis. 
What did we find? 
In this review update, 74 studies involving 5175 patients with lupus nephritis could be studied. Treatments included intravenous (given through a vein) cyclophosphamide, oral (tablets by mouth) mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine, and tacrolimus (used alone or together with MMF). We also found studies of treatments called “biologic” therapies, that have been designed to change very specific parts of the body’s immune system that cause it to attack itself. We looked particularly at key outcomes such as whether treatment prevented patients from needing dialysis and controlled the lupus damage to the kidney tissue (called remission). We also looked at serious side‐effects including death, infection, infertility, and hair loss.
