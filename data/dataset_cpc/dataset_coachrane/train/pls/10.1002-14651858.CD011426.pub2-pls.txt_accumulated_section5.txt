Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) for preventing surgical site infection in wounds that are stitched or held together another way 
Background 
The presence of micro‚Äêorganisms, such as bacteria, at wound sites following surgery can result in surgical site infections for patients. Surgical site infections can result in increased healthcare costs, delays in wound healing and pain. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria or prevent them from developing. Antibiotics can be taken by mouth (orally), directly into veins (intravenously), or applied directly to the skin (topically). Topical antibiotics are often applied to wounds after surgery because it is thought that they prevent surgical site infection. There are thought to be benefits in using antibiotics topically rather than orally or intravenously. As topical antibiotics act only on the area of the body where they are applied, there is less likelihood of unwanted effects that affect the whole body, such as nausea and diarrhoea. Topical antibiotics are also thought to reduce the chances of bacterial resistance (bacteria changing to become resistant to medication). However topical antibiotics can also have unwanted effects, the most common being an allergic reaction on the skin (contact dermatitis), which can cause redness, itching and pain at the site where the topical antibiotic was applied. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about how effective topical antibiotics are in preventing surgical site infection if applied directly to wounds after surgery. We focused on the effect of topical antibiotics on the type of surgical wound where the edges are held closely together so that the wound heals more easily (known as healing by primary intention). The edges of these wounds can be held together with stitches, staples, clips or glue.
