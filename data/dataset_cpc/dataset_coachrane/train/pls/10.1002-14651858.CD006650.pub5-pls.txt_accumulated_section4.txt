Blood thinners for the long‐term treatment of blood clots in people with cancer
BackgroundPeople with cancer are at an increased risk of developing blood clots and might respond differently to different types of blood thinners (anticoagulants). 
Study characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long‐term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. 
Key resultsWe found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding.
