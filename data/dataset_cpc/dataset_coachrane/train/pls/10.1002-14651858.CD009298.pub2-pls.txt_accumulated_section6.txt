Prophylactic manual rotation for fetal malposition to reduce operative delivery and reduce complications for mothers and babies 
Background 
Most babies are in a position where the baby is looking backwards (an anterior position for the back of the head) before and during delivery. When the baby is looking forwards (in the posterior position) or sideways (the transverse position), the baby's head has a wider profile in the birth canal so descent may be more difficult. The posterior and transverse positions are associated with longer labour, more painful labour, the need for epidural pain relief, higher rates of vaginal tears that sometimes includes the anus and rectum, bleeding after birth and infection in the uterus after the birth. It is also more common for the woman to have a forceps, vacuum or caesarean birth, in some instances in the late first or early second stage of labour, and usually when the mother's cervix is fully dilated. 
Manual rotation may be performed to turn the baby's head to the anterior position. Manual rotation entails the use of the accoucheur's hand or fingers to rotate the baby's head. It may take two or three contractions to be performed and the position is commonly held for two contractions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and other databases for clinical trials comparing manual rotation with expectant management (waiting), speeding up of labour or operation. The women were at term (at least 37 weeks of pregnancy). The results are current to October 2014.
