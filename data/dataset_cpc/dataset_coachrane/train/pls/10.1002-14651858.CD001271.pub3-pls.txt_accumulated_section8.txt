Nurses as substitutes for doctors in primary care
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what happens when primary healthcare services are delivered by nurses instead of doctors. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 18 studies for inclusion in the review. 
What are the key messages of this review? 
Delivery of primary healthcare services by nurses instead of doctors probably leads to similar or better patient health and higher patient satisfaction. Nurses probably also have longer consultations with patients. Using nurses instead of doctors makes little or no difference in the numbers of prescriptions and tests ordered. However, the impacts on the amount of information offered to patients, on the extent to which guidelines are followed and on healthcare costs are uncertain. 
What was studied in this review? 
In most countries, the population is growing older and more people have chronic disease. This means that the services that primary healthcare workers need to deliver are changing. At the same time, many countries lack doctors and other healthcare workers, or people struggle to pay for healthcare services. By using nurses instead of doctors, countries hope to deliver care of the same quality for less money. 
In this review, we searched for studies that compared nurses to doctors for delivery of primary care services. We looked at whether this made any difference in patientsâ€™ health, satisfaction, and use of services. We also looked at whether this made any difference in how services were delivered and in how much they cost.
