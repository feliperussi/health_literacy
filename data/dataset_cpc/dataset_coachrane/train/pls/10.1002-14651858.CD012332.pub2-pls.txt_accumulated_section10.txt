Oral NSAIDs for treating fibromyalgia pain in adults
Bottom line 
We found very low‐quality evidence that oral non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have no effect on pain or other symptoms in people with moderate or severe pain from fibromyalgia. Ibuprofen and diclofenac are common NSAIDs. 
Background 
Fibromyalgia is characterised by persistent, widespread pain, sleep problems, and fatigue. NSAIDs are drugs with analgesic (pain‐killing), antipyretic (fever‐reducing) effects, and also with anti‐inflammatory effects at higher doses. NSAIDs are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. 
Our definition of a good result was someone who had a high level of pain relief and was able to keep taking the medicine without side effects that made them want to stop. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for clinical trials in which NSAIDs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. The latest search was in January 2017. Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 292 participants to treatment with NSAID or placebo. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. Study duration was between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported the outcomes of interest. 
Key results 
We found no difference between NSAID or placebo for a range of outcomes. Pain reduction by half or better was experienced by 1 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain reduction by a third or better was experienced by about 2 in 10 with both NSAID and placebo. Side effects were experienced by 3 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo.
