Spinal cord stimulation for cancer pain
People with cancer often experience pain. Cancer pain or cancer‐related pain is one of the worst factors for these patients. This type of pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Despite better analgesics (pain killers) and techniques, cancer pain is still a problem for many people. 
Traditionally, cancer pain was controlled by drugs. When these drugs do not work, other ways of reducing pain can be used, such as neuromodulation (electrical stimulation of the nerves). Spinal cord stimulation is the most common method of neuromodulation. 
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) involves putting electrodes on the spinal cord to control pain. The electrodes deliver impulses that may reduce pain. The technique is reversible and minimally invasive. SCS appears to have very few side effects, e.g. tiredness, compared to drugs used for pain relief. This technique has been widely used in non‐cancer patients, yet the role of SCS for cancer pain is still unclear. 
In the original review, we intended to evaluate how well SCS worked for cancer pain, compared with standard care (e.g. drugs). We also planned to look at harm and side effects of the treatment. To update this review, in October 2014 we looked for clinical trials that used SCS to treat cancer pain. We found no randomised controlled trials and four before‐and‐after case series studies (a total of 92 participants with cancer). All studies were small and of low quality. 
SCS participants used fewer drugs than standard treatment group. The main side effects were infection and pain at the sites of electrodes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, dislodged electrodes, and system failure. However, we could not tell which side effects occurred more frequently in cancer patients compared to non‐cancer patients. 
There is not enough good quality evidence to know whether SCS is better than drugs to relieve cancer pain. More trials comparing SCS with other ways of relieving pain are needed.
