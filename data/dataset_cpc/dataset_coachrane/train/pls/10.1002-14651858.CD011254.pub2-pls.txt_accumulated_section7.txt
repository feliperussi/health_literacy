Agents that prevent the development of abdominal adhesions following surgery: an overview of Cochrane reviews 
Background 
Abdominal adhesions are web like structures that commonly form following abdominal or pelvic surgery. They are a result of damage to the lining of the abdomen and can cause multiple conditions such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Many types of solid, liquid, gel and pharmacological agents have been developed which, when applied during surgery, supposedly reduce the chance that adhesions will develop. However, there has been considerable disagreement as to which agent is more effective. We aimed to summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews regarding anti‐adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery. 
Search results 
Our search up to 31 August 2014 identified two Cochrane reviews. One focused on solid agents, while the other focused on liquid and gel anti‐adhesion agents as well as drugs that may prevent adhesions from forming. All reviews were high quality, though the quality of specific comparisons in each review ranged from low to high as a result of the limitations of the original studies. The characteristics of the women who underwent the trials were recorded poorly among the trials. 
Overview of the effectiveness of different anti‐adhesion agents 
There was no evidence of a difference between liquid agents compared to no treatment or placebo on pelvic pain, pregnancy rates or live birth rates following surgery (moderate quality of evidence). There were no studies that investigated other anti‐adhesion agents in preventing pelvic pain or infertility directly. Adverse events were reported as an outcome by only 10 of the 47 primary studies. These reported no adverse events.
