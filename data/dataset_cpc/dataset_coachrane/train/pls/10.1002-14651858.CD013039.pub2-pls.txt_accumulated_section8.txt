Comparing treatments for advanced tooth decay
Key messages 
For decayed baby (primary) teeth, putting an off‐the‐shelf metal crown over the tooth or only partially removing decay before placing a filling may be better than the conventional treatment of removing all decay before filling. 
For decayed adult (permanent) teeth, partial removal of decay before filling the tooth, or adding a second stage to this treatment where more decay is removed after several months, may be better than conventional treatment. 
What is the condition?  
Dental caries (tooth decay) is very common and can cause pain, eating and speaking difficulties, and self‐consciousness. Teeth are made up of three layers: enamel (hard outer layer), dentine (hard inner layer), and pulp (nerves and blood vessels). Our mouths contain bacteria, which grow in a sticky film over our teeth known as dental plaque. The bacteria live on sugar from our diet and turn it into acid that dissolves the teeth. Saliva can reverse this process, but if there is too much sugar in the diet or bacteria are not removed often enough by toothbrushing then the acids continue to erode the teeth. This can progress into the dentine, eventually causing a hole in the tooth (known as a cavitated carious lesion). If it reaches the pulp, it can cause infection.  
How is the condition treated? 
Dentine/cavitated carious lesions can be treated by complete removal of decayed parts of the tooth and placement of a filling. Dentists call this non‐selective carious tissue removal and conventional restoration (CR). Although effective, this risks weakening the tooth or causing problems if the pulp of the tooth is exposed. Newer alternatives involve removing less or none of the carious tissue:
