Laparoendoscopic single‐site donor nephrectomy (LESS‐DN) versus standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy 
Background 
Kidney transplantation is well established and has a vital role in improving quality of life and longevity for people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD). Open surgical techniques lead to more postoperative pain, a longer hospital stay and a poorer cosmetic outcome for donors but advances in surgical techniques has meant that keyhole surgery is now the gold standard for removing donors' kidneys for transplantation. Keyhole surgery has shorter recovery times, minimal scarring and better outcomes for both donor and recipient. An alternative of this technique is for the surgeon to make a single incision (single site) in the patient's abdomen to enable removal of the kidney. 
We aimed to assess if LESS‐DN provided benefits compared with standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched to literature up to January 2016 and found three studies (reported in 5 publications that involved 179 participants) that compared these two types of kidney donor surgeries. 
Key results 
LESS‐DN was found to be as safe as standard keyhole surgical techniques; pain at discharge was significantly less with LESS‐DN, however there were no other discernible benefits over the standard technique. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, we found there was a low risk of bias for all studies; however, funding sources were not reported in two or three studies, and there was high risk of attrition bias in one study. The small number of studies with few participants eligible for inclusion indicates a need for future research in this area.
