Pulmonary rehabilitation for interstitial lung disease
Review question: we reviewed available evidence on the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on exercise capacity, shortness of breath and quality of life in people with interstitial lung disease (ILD). 
Background: people with ILD (a condition where the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult) often have reduced exercise capacity and shortness of breath during exercise. Pulmonary rehabilitation can improve well‐being in people with other chronic lung diseases, but there is less information regarding the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation in ILD. We wanted to discover whether pulmonary rehabilitation provided advantages over no pulmonary rehabilitation for people with ILD and whether it can be performed safely. We also looked at whether people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a type of ILD that can progress rapidly, could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. 
Studies we found: we included 21 studies involving 909 people with ILD. We combined and compared the results of 16 studies (356 participants received pulmonary rehabilitation and 319 participants did not receive pulmonary rehabilitation). Nine studies included only people with IPF, three studies included only those with sarcoidosis (small patches of red and swollen tissue within the lungs), two studies included only those with occupational dust‐related ILD, and the other eight studies included people with a variety of ILDs. The average age of participants ranged from 36 to 72 years. All pulmonary rehabilitation programmes consisted of endurance training (stepping, walking, cycling or a combination of modalities) and some also included the addition of strength‐training exercises. Most pulmonary rehabilitation programmes lasted for eight to 12 weeks, with participants attending two or three sessions per week.
