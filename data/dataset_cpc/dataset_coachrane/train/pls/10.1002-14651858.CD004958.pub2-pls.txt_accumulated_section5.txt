Fusion techniques for degenerative disc disease
Degenerative disc disease is part of the natural aging process of the human spine and can cause complications stemming from the nerve root or spinal cord. Degenerative disc disease of the spine can result in significant pain, instability, disturbances with the nerve roots or spinal cord, or a combination of symptoms. The cause of these symptoms comes from compression of the nerves. 
When symptoms do not respond to conservative treatment, surgical treatment is considered. The goals of surgical treatment should be to remove pressure from the nerves, restore the alignment of the vertebrae and stabilize the spine. The common surgical technique to treat cervical disc disease is removal of the damaged disc with or without fusing the two adjacent vertebral bodies. Bone grafts (harvesting bone from other sites of the body) are usually used to stimulate the fusion process. 
This review of 33 small studies (2267 participants) evaluated fusion techniques used to treat degenerative disc disease. The major treatments were discectomy (removal of the damaged disc) alone, addition of a fusion procedure (bone transplanted from another part of the body, cement, or cage), and addition of a plate. 
None of the evidence from this systematic review indicates that one technique is better than another for clinically significant pain relief for patients with chronic cervical degenerative disc disease or disc herniation. The choice for a specific technique cannot be made on the most important aspect, pain relief, which was the primary outcome parameter in our review. There is moderate quality evidence that there was little or no difference in Odomâ€™s criteria (a tool that measures the success of the surgery at relieving the symptoms that were troublesome prior to the surgery) between those who received a bone transplant from the hip and a metal cage to help with fusion.
