Thrombopoietin mimetics for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
Background 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders associated with anaemia, bleedings or infections as a result of peripheral cytopenias and a premature progress to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Patients mainly suffer at an elderly age. Bone marrow transplantation remains the only curative option. Thrombocytopenia represents a life‐threatening complication in the course of illness and alternative treatment options to platelet transfusion are limited.The introduction of TPO mimetics (raising platelet counts by imitating the effect of human TPO) in the treatment of MDS may extend the range of therapy. 
Review question 
With this review we aimed to take a closer look at TPO mimetics in the treatment of MDS patients. We intended to focus on changes of overall survival, mortality during study, transformation to AML, incidence of bleeding events, transfusion requirement, health‐related quality of life, all adverse events, and serious adverse events to explore the effect of TPO mimetics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases such as Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries (January 2000 to August 2017). No trial evaluated one TPO mimetic (romiplostim or eltrombopag) versus another. We found eight eligible trials (six included, two ongoing, one of which is completed but without final results for MDS patients) and we included 746 adult patients in our review. The trials were randomised, double‐blinded and used either romiplostim or eltrombopag versus placebo. In four trials hypomethylating agents or immunomodulatory drugs were administered in combination to romiplostim or eltrombopag. Only adults were included.
