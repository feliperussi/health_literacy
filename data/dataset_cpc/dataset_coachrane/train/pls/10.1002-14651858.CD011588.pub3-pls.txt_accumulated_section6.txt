Iron treatment for low red blood cell count prior to surgery
Review question: we reviewed the evidence for giving iron treatment to people with a low red blood cell count (anaemia) before they had major surgery, to see if it reduced their need for blood transfusions around the time of surgery. We found six studies that looked at this question. 
Background: anaemia is a common problem for people about to have surgery. Anaemia can cause dizziness, shortness of breath and lack of energy, as well as increase the risks of surgery and of blood transfusion. Anaemia is commonly due to lack of iron, and iron treatment ‐ with tablets or injections ‐ has been shown to be effective in other situations for treating anaemia. Limited research has looked at whether iron treatment works before surgery. 
Search date: on 30 July 2018 we conducted a wide ranging search of the medical literature to identify relevant medical studies. 
Study characteristics: we looked at adults with anaemia who were due to have an operation, who received iron treatment or usual care, or a 'pretend' iron treatment (placebo) prior to their surgery. We also compared different forms of iron therapy with each other. We included six studies and a total of 372 participants. 
Key results: iron treatment did not reduce the risk of blood transfusion. There is currently insufficient evidence to say whether iron therapy given before surgery prevents transfusions. To date, too few studies involving too small a number of people have been undertaken, and it is not yet possible to obtain a reliable result for the effects of this treatment.
