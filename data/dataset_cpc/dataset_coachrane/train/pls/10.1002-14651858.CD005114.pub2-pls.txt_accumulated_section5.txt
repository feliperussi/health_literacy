Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for lupus erythematosus
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for lupus. The review shows that: 
DHEA probably leads to little or no difference in disease activity in people with mild to moderate disease, but probably slightly improves overall well‐being. These results are based on moderate quality evidence.  DHEA may improve disease activity in people with severe or active lupus, but this result is based on low quality evidence so there is not enough evidence to be certain.  It is not known whether DHEA reduces the damage that lupus causes to organs as damage was not measured in the studies.  Possible side effects may include acne, excessive hair growth, and menstrual changes. But we often do not have precise information about side effects and complications.  It is not known whether DHEA causes long term side effects such as heart problems or cancer. This is because there were not many people in the studies and the longest study was only 1 year long. 
What is Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone)? 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or simply 'lupus' is a group of diseases in which the body's immune system attacks the body. It can affect any organ system involving connective tissue, including the skin, kidneys, eyes, lungs, heart, muscles and bones, nervous system, and gastrointestinal system. The symptoms can range from mild to life‐threatening. Lupus occurs mainly in young women, but also in men and children.  DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone in the body. People with lupus tend to have lower levels of DHEA, so taking DHEA supplements in pill form may help control the immune system. DHEA might also cut the need for corticosteroid treatment which means less side effects from corticosteroids.
