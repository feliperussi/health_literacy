Local anaesthetic nerve block for pain management in labour
Most women find labour painful, although a few do not. Women who give birth more than once, can find very different levels of pain in their different labours. Women generally seek ways to help themselves cope with the labour, and some women look for additional help to manage the pain. 
We looked at different types of local anaesthetic nerve block for control of pain in labour. We considered  the paracervical block, which is an injection of local anaesthetic solution around the cervix, mostly used during the first stage of labour. Also, we looked at the pudendal block, which is an injection of local anaesthetic solution in the area of pudendal nerve in the pelvis, and is generally used in the second stage of labour.  
We found 12 studies involving 1549 women. The studies were small and not of good quality and so we are not sure of the findings. The data suggested that both these local anaesthetics were more effective for pain relief than placebo. There was no difference in regards to pain relief with the use of different local anaesthetic solutions when performing local anaesthetic nerve blocks. Side effects of decreased fetal heart rate, giddiness, sweating and tingling in legs lasted only a short time and were reported in one study of local anaesthetic nerve blocks versus placebo. 
Further good‐quality studies are needed to confirm the findings, to assess other outcomes and compare local anaesthetic nerve blocks with other forms of pain relief in labour.
