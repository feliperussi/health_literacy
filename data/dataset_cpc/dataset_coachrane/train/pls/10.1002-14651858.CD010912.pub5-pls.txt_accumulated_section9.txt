Workplace interventions (methods) for reducing time spent sitting at work
Why is the amount of time spent sitting at work important? 
Time spent sitting and being physically inactive at work has increased in recent decades. Long periods of sitting may increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and premature death. It is unclear whether interventions that aim to reduce sitting at workplaces are effective. 
The purpose of this review 
We wanted to find out the effects of interventions aimed at reducing sitting time at work. We searched the literature in various databases up to 9 August 2017. 
What trials did the review find? 
We found 34 studies conducted with a total of 3,397 employees from high‐income countries. Sixteen studies evaluated physical changes in the workplace design and environment, four studies evaluated changes in workplace policies, 10 studies evaluated information and counselling interventions, and four studies evaluated multi‐category interventions. 
Effect of sit‐stand desks 
The use of sit‐stand desks seems to reduce workplace sitting on average by 84 to 116 minutes per day. When combined with the provision of information and counselling, the use of sit‐stand desks seems to result in similar reductions in sitting at work. Sit‐stand desks also seem to reduce total sitting time (including sitting at work and outside work) and the duration of workplace sitting bouts that last 30 minutes or longer. One study compared standing desks and sit‐stand desks but due to the small number of employees included, it does not provide enough evidence to determine which type of desk is more effective at reducing sitting time.
