How effective are home improvements and other strategies designed to help older people with low vision move around safely? 
Why this question is importantLow vision that cannot be corrected by standard glasses or any medical treatment is called visual impairment. It is common for people to become visually impaired in later life. Older people with visual impairment tend to avoid physical activity; for example, they might walk fewer steps in a day than people who are not visually impaired. They are also more likely to experience anxiety or depression, or to sustain an injury through falling. 
Changes to a person’s environment or behavior can be made to help older, visually impaired people move safely around ‐ inside and outside ‐ their homes. These include adaptations to the home to enable safe movement around it, or improvement to the person’s balance through exercise. 
To find out if strategies designed to help people move around safely are effective for older people with visual impairment, a team of Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence from research studies. Specifically, we wanted to know if these strategies: 
• increase physical activity;• reduce risk of falling;• decrease fear of falling;• increase quality of life. 
How we identified and assessed the evidenceFirst, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low‐, low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty. 
What we foundWe found six studies in a total of 686 older people with visual impairment who were followed for between two and 12 months. People who took part in the studies were aged 80 years on average, and they lived either at home or in a residential setting.
