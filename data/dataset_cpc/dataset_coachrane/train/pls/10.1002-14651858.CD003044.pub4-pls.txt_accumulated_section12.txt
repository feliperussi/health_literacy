Are non‐absorbable disaccharides associated with beneficial or harmful effects in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy? 
Background 
Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with cirrhosis may develop hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that results in poor brain functioning. Hepatic encephalopathy may be clinically obvious (overt) with changes including poor concentration, tremor, and alterations in consciousness. Others have no obvious clinical changes (minimal) but, when tested, some aspects of brain function such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are impaired. 
The reason why people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex. The accumulation of ammonia plays a key role. The non‐absorbable disaccharides, lactulose and lactitol, are indigestible sugars that reduce the levels of ammonia in the blood. 
Review question 
We investigated the use of non‐absorbable disaccharides for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis by reviewing randomised clinical trials (RCTs). 
Search date 
The search date was October 2015.
Study funding sources 
Seven RCTs received financial support and 11 RCTs received lactitol or inactive placebo free of charge from a pharmaceutical company. 
Study characteristics 
We included 29 RCTs comparing non‐absorbable disaccharides with inactive placebo or no intervention and nine RCTs comparing lactulose with lactitol. Seven of the included RCTs evaluated the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy and 31 evaluated the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Sixteen of the treatment RCTs included people with overt hepatic encephalopathy while 15 included people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The duration of treatment varied depending on the type of hepatic encephalopathy from five days to one year.
