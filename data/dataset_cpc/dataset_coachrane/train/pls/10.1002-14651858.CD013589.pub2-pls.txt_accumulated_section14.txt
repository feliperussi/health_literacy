Therapies for treating pain in ulcerative colitis
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether treatments for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) can improve pain. 
We analysed data from five studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We cannot draw conclusions about any of these treatments for the management of pain in UC because of the very low certainty of the evidence. 
It is unclear whether any of the therapies considered are better than each other, but there is limited evidence due to low numbers of studies and participants, and issues due to low certainty of the reporting of the research studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
People with ulcerative colitis commonly suffer pain, whether their disease is active on inactive. 
Several types of therapies have tried to reduce pain in ulcerative colitis, including diets, psychological therapies, drugs, exercise therapies and brain therapies. 
There is currently no agreement amongst clinicians as to which therapy is better.
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing any treatment with another or with a dummy/placebo treatment. We found five RCTs looking at 360 participants. 
1) Authors reported improvement in pain for a relaxation training compared to no relaxation training, but we cannot draw conclusions about whether this is really the case because of the very low certainty of the evidence.
