Image‐guided surgery for brain tumours
Background 
Surgery has a key role in the management of many types of brain tumour. Removing as much tumour as possible is very important, as in some types of brain tumour this can help people to live longer and to feel better. However, removing a brain tumour may be difficult because the tumour either looks like normal brain tissue or is near brain tissue that is needed for normal functioning. New methods of seeing tumours during surgery (called imaging) have been developed to help surgeons better identify tumour from normal brain tissue. 
Questions 
Is image‐guided surgery more effective at removing brain tumours than surgery without image guidance? 
Is one image‐guidance technology or tool better than another?
Study characteristics 
Our search strategy is up to date as of May 2020. We found four trials looking at three different tools to help improve the amount of tumour that is removed. The tumour being evaluated was glioma. Imaging interventions used during surgery included: 
– magnetic resonance imaging during surgery to assess the amount of remaining tumour;– fluorescent dye to mark out the tumour (5‐aminolevulinic acid);– imaging before surgery to map out the location of a tumour, which was then used at the time of surgery to guide the surgery (neuronavigation); or– ultrasound imaging during surgery to assess the amount of remaining tumour. 
All the studies had compromised methods, which could mean their conclusions were biased. Some studies were funded by the manufacturers of the image guidance technology being evaluated. We intended to use a form of analysis called network meta‐analysis (which can incorporate comparisons of interventions even if they have not been directly compared within trials) to compare each of these interventions and identify which single technology might be best.
