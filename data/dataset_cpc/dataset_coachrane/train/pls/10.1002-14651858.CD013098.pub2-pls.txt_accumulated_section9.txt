Changing the length of time a worker is allowed to take time off work because of illness without a physician's certificate 
What was the aim of this review? 
To find out if it is possible to affect sickness absence by changing the length of time a worker is allowed to take time off work because of illness without a physician's certificate. We found five studies. 
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether changing the length of time a worker is allowed to take time off work because of illness without a physician's certificate has any effect on sickness absence, as the included studies reported very different results, and the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. 
What was studied in the review? 
Sickness absence prevents a person from working and thus may reduce income and causes costs to employers. Usually employers require a physician to certify sickness absence. This may not be meaningful in cases of less severe illnesses that pass quickly with rest. Self‐certification of sickness absence is already used at many workplaces for sickness absence periods lasting typically from one day up to two weeks. In this review, we evaluated how change in the length of the self‐certification period affects the mean number of sickness absence days, number of sickness absence periods, and the amount of lost work time at workplaces. 
Why is this topic important? 
Sickness absence is costly to society and to employers. Employers may have to continue paying the sick employee’s salary. After the employer’s obligation to pay has ended, insurance covers sickness benefits. Changing the practice of sickness certification in short sickness absences is expected to change employees' attitudes and behaviour, co‐operation and climate at the workplace, and diminish sickness absence. Self‐certification makes more healthcare resources available for other purposes.
