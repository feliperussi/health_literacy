Interventions for metabolic bone disease in children with chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) resulting in reduced kidney function and the need for dialysis and kidney transplant is associated with abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus levels leading to high levels of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and to bone disease. This may result in bone deformities, bone pain, fractures and reduced growth rates. Commonly used treatments (vitamin D compounds and phosphate binders) aim to prevent or correct these outcomes. However, these treatments may raise levels of blood calcium, allow calcium and phosphorus deposition in blood vessels and lead to early cardiovascular disease, which is known to be a problem in adults with CKD. 
This review identified 18 small randomised studies involving 576 children comparing different vitamin D compounds administered via different routes and frequencies and different phosphate binders. Only five studies reported growth rates and no differences were detected between treatments. Bone disease, as assessed by changes in PTH levels, was improved by all vitamin D preparations regardless of preparation or route or frequency of administration. Fewer episodes of high blood calcium levels occurred with the non‐calcium‐containing binder, sevelamer, compared with calcium‐containing binders. As newer treatments for renal bone disease are developed, comparisons with the current standard therapies will be required in well‐designed randomised studies in children using outcome measures including those of direct clinical relevance to children and their families such as rates of growth, reduction in bone fractures and bone pain and reduction in calcification in blood vessels.
