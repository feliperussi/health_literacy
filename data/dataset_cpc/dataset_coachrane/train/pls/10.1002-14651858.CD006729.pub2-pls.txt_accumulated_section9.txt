Assistive technology for rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of assistive technology in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, only one trial met the inclusion criteria for the review. The study deals with assistive technology used to administer eye drops. This is not a commonly used device. 
Assistive technology devices are intended to make life with rheumatoid arthritis easier. It is defined as any equipment used to improve or maintain function in persons with disabilities. Assistive technology is one of the most frequent interventions used for persons with rheumatoid arthritis, besides medications and surgery. 
There is very limited evidence for the effect of assistive technology for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is an urgent need for high‐quality research investigating commonly used devices. 
The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis: 
‐ An eye drop device may improve the ability to squeeze out drops, aim drops, and control the number of drops.  ‐ An eye drop device may prevent side effects caused by the eye drop bottle touching the eye itself. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is an eye drop device? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints, making them inflamed.  Inflammation makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful and may lead to loss of function and disability. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so the treatments focus on reducing inflammation, relieving pain and stiffness, and improving function in daily life. 
An eye drop device is an assistive technology that makes it easier to give yourself eye drops by making the bottle easier to hold, easier to squeeze and to get the drops right into your eye.
