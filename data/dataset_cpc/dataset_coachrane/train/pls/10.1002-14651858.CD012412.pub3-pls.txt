Protein hydrolysate versus standard formula for preterm infants
Review question 
Does feeding preterm infants cow's milk formula containing predigested (hydrolysed) proteins, rather than whole proteins, improve digestion and reduce the risk of severe bowel problems? 
Background 
Preterm infants often find cow's milk formula more difficult to digest than human milk, and cow's milk formula may increase the risk of severe bowel problems for preterm (born before their due date) infants. If preterm infants are fed cow's milk formula (when human milk is unavailable), then using a formula in which the protein is already partially digested (called 'hydrolysed') rather than a standard formula (with intact proteins) might reduce the risk of these problems. However, hydrolysed formulas are more expensive than standard formulas, and may have specific side effects not seen with standard formulas. Given these concerns, we have reviewed all available evidence from clinical trials that compared these types of formula for feeding preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
In searches of medical databases up to 28 January 2019, we found 11 relevant trials; most were small (involving 665 infants in total) and had methodological weaknesses. 
Key results 
Currently available evidence suggests that feeding preterm infants hydrolysed formula (rather than standard formula) during their initial hospital admission has no important benefits or harms. However, this finding is not yet conclusive, and larger trials of better quality are needed to provide evidence to help clinicians and families make informed choices about this issue. 
Quality of evidence 
Data from these trials provide no strong or consistent evidence that feeding preterm infants hydrolysed formula rather than standard formula improved or worsened digestion or changed the risk of severe bowel problems.
