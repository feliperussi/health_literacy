Vitamin K supplementation to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is a global burden and varies between regions, and this variation has been linked in part to dietary factors. Such factors are important because they can be modified to help with CVD prevention and management.This review assessed the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation as a single supplement at reducing cardiovascular death, all‐cause death, non‐fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of vitamin K supplementation in healthy adults or those at high risk of developing CVD. We did not include people who already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to September 2014. 
Key results 
Only one small trial met our inclusion criteria. It included 60 participants aged 40 to 65 years. This study looked at the effects of vitamin K2 supplements on CVD risk factors (blood pressure and lipid levels) over three months in healthy participants. No differences in these risk factors were seen between the comparison groups, but this was a small study and the findings are limited. The trial did not look at fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular endpoints as it was small and short term. 
The evidence is currently extremely limited and further high‐quality trials are needed so that the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation for CVD prevention can be determined.
