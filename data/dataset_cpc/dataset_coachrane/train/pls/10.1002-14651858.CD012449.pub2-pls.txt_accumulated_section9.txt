Perceptions and experiences of labour companionship
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore how women, families, and health workers experience women going through labour and childbirth with a support person ('labour companion'). A labour companion may be the woman’s partner, family member, trained supporter (doula), or nurse/midwife. We collected and analysed all relevant qualitative studies to answer this question. 
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review by Bohren and colleagues from 2017 that assesses the effect of continuous support for women during childbirth. Continuous support improves health and well‐being for women and babies but factors affecting successful implementation are not well understood. 
Key messages 
Labour companions provide women with information, practical, and emotional support, and can speak up in support of women. Companions can help women have a positive birth experience and need to be compassionate and trustworthy. However, not all women who want a labour companion have one, especially in lower‐resource settings. 
What was studied in this synthesis? 
We use the term 'labour companionship' to describe support provided to women during labour and childbirth. In high‐income countries, women are often accompanied by family members or a doula. But in health facilities in low‐ and middle‐income countries, women may not be allowed to have any support person, and may go through labour and childbirth alone. 
Bohren's review from 2017 shows that supporting women during childbirth has positive effects on women's experiences and on their health. We sought to understand how women, partners, and healthcare providers felt about labour companionship, and what factors might influence women's access to labour companionship.
