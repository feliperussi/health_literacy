What did this review study? Diabetes is a life‐long condition that means that there is too much sugar in the blood. Usually, our bodies regulate the levels of sugar in the blood with a hormone called insulin. In diabetes, either there is not enough insulin to deal with the sugar, or the insulin does not work. People with diabetes can experience problems with their eyes. High blood sugar can affect the blood vessels at the back of the eye. This is known as diabetic retinopathy and can lead to problems with vision, including blindness in severe cases. 
Worldwide, many medicinal herbs or herbal extracts are used to treat diabetic retinopathy. The Cochrane researchers looked at six different types of herbal medicines: Ruscus extract tablet, Sanqi Tongshu capsule, tetramethylpyrazine injection, Xueshuantong injection, Xuesaitong injection and Puerarin injection. These treatments lasted from two weeks to 12 months. 
What were the main results of the review? The Cochrane researchers found 10 relevant studies involving 754 participants; nine studies were from China and one was from Poland. 
These studies compared herbal medicine combined with conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone for people with diabetic retinopathy. None of the studies reported where the funding for the study came from. The findings were as follows.
