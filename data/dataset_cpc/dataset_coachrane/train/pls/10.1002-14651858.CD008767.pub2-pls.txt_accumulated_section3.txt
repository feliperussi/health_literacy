This review searched for trials of women followed up after their first treatment for cervical cancer to find out the best approach to this care.  
Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death in women worldwide. The development of new diagnostic, treatment and follow‐up strategies for cervical cancer merits attention. After completing treatment for cervical cancer, women are followed‐up at regular intervals by their doctor/healthcare professional to identify whether the cancer has come back or has continued to grow even before the woman experiences symptoms of this. Follow‐up also helps doctors to monitor for side effects that have happened because of the treatment. Currently, women in the UK usually have follow‐up appointments every three months for one year, every six months for the next two years and then yearly for five years after completion of treatment. The idea behind these follow‐up appointments is that women will receive prompt treatment if the cancer has come back, and this will improve their survival from the cancer and their quality of life. Evidence from RCTs is needed to ascertain whether this is the case. If it is, we also need to know how often it is best for women to have follow‐up appointments, which healthcare professional should conduct the follow‐up and what should happen at follow‐up appointments, for example, what investigations would be useful. 
In this review, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different follow‐up approaches after first treatment for cervical cancer. We aimed to compare follow‐up that is medical or nurse‐led and is set down in a written procedure versus follow‐up that is medical or nurse‐led but responsive to the needs of women rather than being written in a procedure and delivered at pre‐set times. We also wished to compare these types of follow‐up versus follow‐up initiated by the patient.
