Zinc supplementation for improving the health and survival of infants less than six months old 
Review question: does zinc supplementation reduce mortality, morbidity and increase growth in infants aged less than six months old? 
Background: zinc deficiency is prevalent in the world. Adequate zinc levels are linked to decreased deaths, illnesses and improved growth in all populations particularly in developing countries. Zinc supplementation in older children has shown some positive effects. 
Study characteristics: we searched for studies through January 2020 that enrolled healthy infants aged less than six months old and provided at least six months of zinc supplementation. We included eight studies that covered zinc supplementation compared with placebo, zinc and riboflavin compared with riboflavin only, zinc, riboflavin and B complex vitamins compared with riboflavin and B complex vitamins. 
Key results and certainty of evidence: zinc had no effect on decreasing deaths or illnesses in children younger than 12 months. Moderate‐ to good‐certainty evidence from three studies suggested an increase in weight‐for‐age Z‐scores and weight‐for‐length Z‐scores after zinc supplementation for six months compared to placebo only. Only one study could be analysed for zinc and riboflavin supplementation compared to riboflavin only, and the results suggested a decrease in wasting after 24 months of supplementation and an increase in stunting after 21 months. 
Conclusion: with this evidence, we cannot strongly recommend clinicians to prescribe zinc supplements to children under six months of age. We also encourage the development of trials that will provide zinc as well as other micronutrients in this age group and for such trials to evaluate outcomes such as death, disease, side effects and growth.
