Use of small volumes of breath insufflation for intraoperative mechanical ventilation during surgery 
Background 
Inspiration (breathing in) is produced by the shortening (contraction) of various muscles that stretch the lungs to increase their size like rubber balloons. During this phase, oxygen enters the lungs. When these muscles stop their contractions, the lungs go back to their initial size. During this phase, carbon dioxide goes out of the lungs. When people are cared for under general anaesthesia, some of the drugs used will stop the movements of the muscles controlling lung size. Insufflation is the act of mechanically forcing air into a person's respiratory system. A machine is required to replace the effects of the muscles. A mixture of gas containing oxygen is blown into the lungs. It is actually not known whether it is better to blow small volumes of gas at a higher rate or bigger volumes at a lower rate. In this review, we tried to determine whether this volume should be lower or higher than 10 millilitres per kilogram of body weight. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases up to 19 May 2017. We included 19 studies with 1548 adults of both sexes. The participants had had operations on the abdomen (tummy), heart, blood vessels of the lungs, back, lower limbs or various surgeries. Two studies mentioned financial support from the pharmaceutical industry or from medical equipment manufacturers. We do not think that this had an effect on the results as high or low volumes may be administered with any machine.
