Desmopressin for treating nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms
Review question 
Is desmopressin effective for treating nocturia in men?
Background 
Nocturia is the bothersome symptom of waking one or more times per night to pass urine. It is common in older men. More than half of men older than 70 years of age have nocturia, and there are many reasons for this. Desmopressin is a drug that regulates urine volume and concentration in the body. It is also used to treat nocturia. 
Study characteristics 
The search is up‐to‐date to 1 August 2017. We identified 14 clinical trials including 2966 men. We compared desmopressin alone or in combination with other medicines used for urinary problems (such as alpha‐blockers or anticholinergics) against placebo (pretend treatment), behaviour changes, or medicines used for urinary problems alone or in combination. Most of the included studies enrolled only older men. 
Key results 
Treatment with desmopressin for three to 12 months may reduce how often men urinate at night in a small number of men compared to placebo. Serious side effects were not increased. We do not know how the use of desmopressin compares to changes in behaviour. The effect of desmopressin on how often men urinate at night is likely to be similar to that of alpha‐blockers when given for up to three months (i.e. short‐term treatment) without major side effects. Adding desmopressin to an alpha‐blocker seems to work little better than an alpha‐blocker alone or an alpha‐blocker combined with an anticholinergic. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence to be low in most cases, meaning that we cannot fully trust the results. The included studies were poorly designed, small, and only followed people for a short time (usually three months or less).
