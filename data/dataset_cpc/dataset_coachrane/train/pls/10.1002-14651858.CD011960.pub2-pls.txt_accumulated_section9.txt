Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes.
