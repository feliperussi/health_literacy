The role of removing lymph nodes as part of standard surgery for endometrial cancer
The issue  Cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer) is now the most common gynaecological cancer among women in western Europe and North America. Most of these women (75%) have tumours confined to the body of the womb at the time of diagnosis, and three‐quarters of women will survive for 10 years after diagnosis. Lymph node metastases can be found in one in 10 women who appear to have cancer confined to the womb at the time of diagnosis, and removal of all pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes has been advocated, even for women with presumed early‐stage cancer. This recommendation is based on non‐randomised studies that suggested improvement in survival following removal of pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes. However, treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not be beneficial, and additional treatment to lymph nodes might not necessarily be better treatment, especially as surgical removal of lymph nodes has serious potential short‐term and long‐term harmful effects. 
The aim of the review  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lymphadenectomy in the management of endometrial cancer. 
What are the main findings?  We found only three trials that compared lymphadenectomy with no lymphadenectomy among women with endometrial cancer. One of these trials could not be included in the meta‐analysis of this review, as it provided insufficient information about outcomes for women. When we combined findings from the two remaining trials, which included 1945 women, we found no evidence that women who received lymphadenectomy were less likely to die or have a relapse of their cancer. In addition, severe adverse events experienced as a consequence of lymphadenectomy outnumbered those reported when no lymphadenectomy was performed.
