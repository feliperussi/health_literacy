Doxycycline plus ivermectin for preventing and treating river blindness (onchocerciasis)
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of adding doxycycline to ivermectin, the usual treatment for people with river blindness (RB). RB also is known as onchocerciasis. 
Background 
RB is caused by an infection of worms. The worms are transmitted from person to person by a small biting fly, which breeds in fast flowing rivers and streams, mainly in West Africa. Both tiny (young) and large (adult) worms exist in the infected person. These worms cause severe itching and thickening of the skin. Only the tiny worms can enter the eyes. They can damage the eye, causing loss of vision. 
RB is treated with ivermectin, which targets the tiny, young worms. It does not kill the large, adult worms. Adult worms need a certain type of bacteria (Wolbachia) to live. Doxycycline is an antibiotic. If doxycycline is able to kill this type of bacteria in the body, adult worms cannot live. The purpose of this review is to find out if combining the antibiotic doxycycline with ivermectin might provide additional benefit in preventing and treating RB. 
Study characteristics 
As of 15 July 2015, we identified three randomized controlled trials. A total of 466 people with RB participated in the three trials. The trials were conducted in Cameroon, Ghana, and Liberia. In the Cameroon and Ghana trials, people with RB took doxycycline or placebo (sugar pills) for four weeks or six weeks. One dose of ivermectin was then given four or six months later. People were then followed for two to three years. In the trial from Liberia, people with RB were divided into two groups. One group was given doxycycline for 6 weeks followed by a single dose of ivermectin. The other group was given ivermectin alone. Both Liberian groups were followed up for six months.
