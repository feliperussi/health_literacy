Mental illness during pregnancy and the postnatal period can consist of a short period of mood swings, crying spells, irritability (baby blues), depression and postnatal psychosis. Postnatal depression (PND) falls along this spectrum. The morbidity caused by PND is enormous. Possible symptoms can include depressive mood, loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, feelings of guilt, and thoughts of suicide in the first three months after giving birth. These can negatively impact on infant feeding, maternal‐infant interaction and the mother's perceptions of infant behaviour. Several psychological or psychosocial interventions appear to be effective for treating the disorder, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy, counselling with or without antidepressants, health visitor‐led counselling, peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. In regard to prevention however, psychosocial or psychological interventions have not shown a clear benefit in preventing the development of PND. Although hypnosis has been used for a long time to reduce pain during labour and birth, the effectiveness of hypnosis for preventing PND has not yet been evaluated. Hypnosis can be described as a heightened state of focal concentration and receptivity to the suggestions of another person. This person brings about the hypnotic state by focusing the person's attention on a monotonous routine. This review included one study (involving 63 women) but it did not contribute any data to this review. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether hypnosis is effective for preventing PND when compared with usual antenatal, birthing, or postnatal care procedures. Two trials are currently underway however, which may provide further information in the future.
