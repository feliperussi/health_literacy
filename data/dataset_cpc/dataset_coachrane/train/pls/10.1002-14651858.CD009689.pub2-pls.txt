Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following treatment of spasticity after stroke 
Stroke can cause muscle stiffness, spasms or tightness in the affected arm or leg, with pain and abnormal positioning of the limb. Consequently, there may be difficulties using the arm or leg in everyday activities or in caring for the affected limb. Treatments for spasticity may include botulinum toxin and other injected medications that paralyse the affected muscles. Following such injections, a multidisciplinary (MD) rehabilitation programme (usually delivered by two or more health professionals) is often employed. Interventions may include stretching, splinting, gait training, repetitive practice in using the arm for tasks, and orthotic prescription. Therapies are aimed at reducing spasticity to improve limb use or positioning, or to make it easier to care for the affected limb. The outcomes of such programmes focus on attainment of functional goals that are important to affected people in their everyday life. We included three relevant studies in the review, which investigated different types of MD rehabilitation interventions after botulinum toxin injections into the arms of 91 adults with previous stroke. There was low quality evidence for intensive forced use of the affected arm in improving spasticity, and very low quality evidence for elbow splinting with occupational therapy. We did not identify any studies of MD rehabilitation in children with post‚Äêstroke spasticity or after other injected medications. The review findings are limited by the small number of studies that are methodologically flawed. More research is needed into what rehabilitation modalities and treatments are most effective for spasticity management following stroke.
