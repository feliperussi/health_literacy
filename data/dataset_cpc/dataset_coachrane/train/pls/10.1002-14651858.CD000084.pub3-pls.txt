External cephalic version for breech presentation before term
Babies born bottom first (in the breech position) may have more problems during birth than those who are born head first (in the cephalic position) because there may be some delay in birth of the head and pressure on the umbilical cord as the head passes through the birth canal. During an external cephalic version (ECV) a breech baby is turned to the head down position by gently pushing on the mother's abdomen. Research shows that ECV after 37 weeks reduces the number of babies in the breech position at full term, and the number of caesarean sections. 
This review included five randomised controlled studies with an overall total of 2187 women, the studies were at low or unclear risk of bias although it was not possible to "blind" women and staff to this intervention. Results showed that if ECV is done near the middle of the third trimester (32 to 34 weeks), it increases the chances that the baby will be lying head down at full term. Three trials including 1888 women found that beginning ECV at between 34 and 36 weeks compared with beginning ECV after 37 weeks (at term) had a 19% decrease in the rate of non‚Äêcephalic presentation at birth, a 10% reduction in the risk of failing to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth, and a considerably reduced chance of a breech vaginal delivery, however, early ECV may significantly increase the chances of late preterm birth. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was graded as high. The evidence on the possible advantages and disadvantages of early (before 37 weeks) external cephalic version (ECV) will require careful discussion with women about the timing of the ECV procedure so that they can make informed decisions.
