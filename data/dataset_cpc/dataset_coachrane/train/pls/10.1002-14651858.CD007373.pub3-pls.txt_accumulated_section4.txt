Methods to reduce pain with insertion of intrauterine contraception
Fear of pain with insertion of intrauterine contraception (IUC) may cause women to avoid using this very effective method of birth control. IUC includes devices with copper and with the hormone levonorgestrel. Researchers have studied many ways of reducing pain with IUC insertion. These include drugs that lessen uterine cramps, soften and open the cervix (uterus opening), or numb the cervix. 
We reviewed randomized trials of reducing pain during IUC insertion through 22 June 2015. We found 33 studies with a total of 5710 women. Most were recent trials. Methods tested were nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lidocaine, misoprostol, and other treatments. Lidocaine 2% gel had no effect on pain during IUC insertion (three trials) or pain with tenaculum (type of forceps) placement (two trials). Other types of lidocaine showed some effect. Pain score for IUC insertion was lower with a lidocaine and prilocaine cream and with 10% lidocaine spray. With 4% lidocaine gel, pain scores were lower shortly after IUC insertion. With 1% lidocaine injection, pain score at tenaculum placement was lower compared with no intervention. 
With four misoprostol trials, the pain score with IUC insertion was higher for misoprostol versus placebo ('dummy' treatment). Two other trials showed higher pain scores with misoprostol versus placebo either at IUC insertion or after. However, another study showed the misoprostol group had less serious IUC‐insertion pain. Also, the misoprostol group rated the insertion more favorably. In analysis of four trials, cramping was more likely with misoprostol versus placebo. Within two other trials, the misoprostol group was more likely to have shivering, headache, or abdominal pain. In one study, the misoprostol group was less likely to choose the treatment again or recommend it.
