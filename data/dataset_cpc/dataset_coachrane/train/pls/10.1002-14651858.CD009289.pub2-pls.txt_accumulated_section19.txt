Do azole medicines taken as a cream or drops work for treating otomycosis (a fungal ear infection)? 
Key messages 
Due to weak evidence, we do not know if:
‐ azoles taken as a cream or drops are better than no treatment or a placebo (dummy) treatment; 
‐ some azoles are better at ending infections than others.
There is a need for well‐conducted studies that investigate the risks and benefits of these treatments for otomycosis. 
What is otomycosis? 
Otomycosis is an ear infection caused by micro‐organisms called fungi (related to yeast and mushrooms). It mostly affects people who live in warm or tropical areas. Otomycosis typically causes an itchy ear, and can also cause ear pain, hearing loss and a fluid (discharge) that comes out of the ear. 
Otomycosis can be treated with many different creams or drops that fight fungi and are applied to the ears (topical treatments). The most widely used of these come from a group of medicines called azoles. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the risks and benefits of using topical azoles to treat otomycosis. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared topical azole treatment against:
‐ a placebo (dummy) treatment;
‐ no treatment; or
‐ other azole treatments.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies that involved 559 people from Spain, Mexico and India. Three studies included children and adults, and one included only adults.
