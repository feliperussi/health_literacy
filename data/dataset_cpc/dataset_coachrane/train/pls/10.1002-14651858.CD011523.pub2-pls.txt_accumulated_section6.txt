Medical or operative treatment for ulcers in the stomach and upper small intestine resistant to medical treatment 
Review question 
In people who have stomach or upper small intestinal ulcers (peptic ulcers) that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment (refractory peptic ulcers) or comes back after healing (recurrent peptic ulcers), is medical or surgical treatment better? 
Background 
Approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 800 people have peptic ulcers. The major causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and smoking. People who have peptic ulcer have upper abdominal pain, which is sometimes accompanied by dyspepsia (that is fullness, bloating, loss of appetite after eating a small amount of food, or nausea). The most serious complications of peptic ulcers are bleeding from the ulcer and perforation of the peptic ulcer, which results in stomach or upper small intestinal contents or both leaking into the tummy. About 1 in 10 people with bleeding peptic ulcer and 1 in 4 people with perforated peptic ulcer die. Peptic ulcers cause approximately 3000 to 4500 deaths per year in the US. 
Currently, medical management, usually with a group of drugs called proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole and lansoprazole), is the mainstay treatment for uncomplicated peptic ulcers. Recently concerns have arisen about the risk of fractures with long‐term use of proton pump inhibitors. The alternative to medical treatment for refractory and recurrent peptic ulcer is surgical treatment to decrease the acid secretion in the stomach with the goal of curing the peptic ulcer. It is not known whether medical or surgical management is a better option for people with a refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer. We attempted to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies comparing medical and surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcers.
