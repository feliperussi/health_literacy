Drugs and pacemakers for transient loss of consciousness
Neurally mediated reflex syncope (including fainting) is the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness. It is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure and/or lowering of heart rate. The main treatment goal therefore is to increase blood pressure and heart rate. In most patients, this can be achieved by non‐pharmacological treatment measures (e.g. adequate fluid and salt intake, physical counterpressure manoeuvres). In patients not responding to this treatment, pharmacological or pacemaker treatment might be considered. We investigated the effectiveness of these treatments for different subtypes of neurally mediated reflex syncope, namely vasovagal syncope (fainting), carotid sinus syncope (fainting due to pressure on the neck) and situational syncope (fainting when passing urine of faeces or swallowing). Where data were available, we determined the treatment effectiveness for different outcome measures including occurrence of syncope, amount of (pre‐)syncopes per year during follow‐up and quality of life. 
We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope. No studies on situational syncope matched the criteria for inclusion in our review. Studies in general were small with a median size of 42 patients. A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using placebo control treatment. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. The type of outcomes reported by studies varied considerably with only 16 studies reporting on non‐provoked recurrences during follow‐up. As a consequence of all these differences, results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. In some studies significant results were reported for one type of outcome, but not for other outcomes.
