Antibiotic prophylaxis for third‐ and fourth‐degree perineal tear during vaginal birth
Background 
Most women are able to give birth without serious damage to their perineum. However, severe perineal trauma, which affects the muscle or tissue in the back passage, occurs in 1% to 8% of women giving birth and is common when forceps are used. There is an increased chance of infection when this happens. Pain in this area can impact not only on a woman's daily activity but also on her relationship with her baby and her partner. 
When a woman has a severe perineal tear during vaginal birth, there is thought to be an increased risk of infection. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent infection. 
Review question  To assess how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is to prevent perineal wound infection compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent perineal wound infection and to compare different antibiotic regimens. 
Main findings 
The review identified one trial, involving 147 women. This trial was conducted to explore the benefit of routine prophylactic antibiotics (intervention group) versus placebo (control group) for women with severe perineal tears. The result showed fewer perineal wound complications in the intervention group at two weeks postpartum. There was no statistically significant difference in perineal wound complications before discharge and at six weeks' postpartum. 
The one included study was terminated before it reached the pre‐planned sample size and had a high rate of loss to follow‐up 
Quality of the evidence 
The included study was of high methodological quality except for incomplete follow‐up. We assessed reduction of perineal wound infection in third‐ or fourth‐degree tear by antibiotic prophylaxis as low to moderate quality of the evidence. However, the results are based on one small trial and there was a high loss to follow‐up. More research is needed.
