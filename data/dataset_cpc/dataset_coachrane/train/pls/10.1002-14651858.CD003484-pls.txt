Dopamine for prevention of morbidity and mortality in term newborn infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia 
Dopamine to improve outcomes in newborn infants with a suspected lack of oxygen during birth. A lack of oxygen around the time of birth (perinatal asphyxia) can cause death and long‚Äêterm illness in newborn infants. It is indicated by a low Apgar score five minutes after birth and acidic umbilical cord blood (acidosis). An infant experiencing asphyxia may need urgent resuscitation, oxygen and supported breathing (assisted ventilation). Often they have low blood pressure and poor heart function. The drug dopamine stimulates the heart and is used to improve blood flow to the brain and other organs to reduce brain and other organ damage. Possible adverse events from giving such an agent include damage with the umbilical venous catheter and heart irregularities (arrhythmias). The review authors searched the medical literature and were able to find only one small randomised controlled trial. The 14 infants included in the trial had a birthweight over 2000 g and were enrolled at a mean age of 10 hours. They had received ventilatory support and fluid expansion after birth. Infants treated with low dose dopamine (2.5 microg/kg/min) did not differ from the infants receiving placebo (dextrose water) in the number who died before discharge from hospital. Neurodevelopmental disability was similar in both groups, in all infants randomised and in survivors. The timing of assessments was variable. These findings are limited with only one small study in which three of 12 survivors were lost to follow up.
