Continuous glucose monitoring systems for monitoring cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes
Review question 
Canusing continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) help people with cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes (CFRD) manage their condition better? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life‐shortening genetic condition. Many people with CF also develop CFRD, where their blood glucose, or the amount of sugar in their blood, can rise to harmful levels. People with CFRD seem to experience more frequent chest infections and a shorter life expectancy than people with CF who do not have diabetes. 
CFRD can be managed with injections of insulin to help keep blood sugar in the normal range. To do this safely, people with CFRD need to routinely check blood sugar levels to make sure that they are taking the right amount of insulin. They usually do this by pricking their fingers and measuring a drop of blood on a machine. CGMS are devices that can be worn by a person and which closely estimate blood sugar levels without the need for regular pin‐prick testing. They are a relatively new technology and we still do not know how they affect the monitoring and management of CFRD. 
We wanted to find out whether using CGMS was better or worse than other methods, such as using the traditional 'finger stick' method, for monitoring blood sugar levels inpeople with CFRD. The main outcomes we wanted to look at were quality of life, any problems the CGMS might cause, and the amount of time a person's blood sugar stayed in the normal range. We decided that theseoutcomes were most important afterasking people with CFRD and their families what mattered most to them.
