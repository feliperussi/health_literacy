Methods of decreasing infection to improve outcomes after liver resections
Liver resections involve removing a part of the liver mainly for cancer or pre‐cancerous growths. Liver resections are major operations associated with about 3.5% risk of death and about 10% to 15% risk of major post‐operative complications (defined as complications resulting in a prolongation of hospital stay). Various methods have been advocated to decrease the infectious complications after liver resection. We do not know if they are of any benefit to the patient or the health‐care funder. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (available until August 2011) to determine the benefits and harms of different interventions in decreasing the infectious complications and improving the outcomes after liver resection. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. Such trials, when conducted properly, provide the best evidence. 
We included seven trials involving 521 patients for this review. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 12 to 180. The comparisons performed included whether antibiotics are necessary routinely during the peri‐operative period of liver resection, the duration of antibiotics, and the use of other agents to improve the general body resistance to infection. There was no difference in the risk of death or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. All the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (ie, there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance). We are unable to advocate or refute any method of decreasing infectious complications after liver resection. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.
