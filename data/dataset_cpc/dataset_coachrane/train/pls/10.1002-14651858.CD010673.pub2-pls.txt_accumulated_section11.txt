Psychotherapy for treatment of anxiety in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) 
Why is this review important? 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is commonly referred to as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. People with COPD are more likely to have anxiety disorders compared with the general population. Symptoms of anxiety affect various aspects of daily life, including quality of life and the ability to perform physical activities. Psychological therapies are used as part of clinical practice to treat these symptoms, however, there is little evidence to support these techniques. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Health professionals and people with emphysema and underlying anxiety and panic.
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
What is the current evidence on psychological therapies for anxiety in people with COPD and coexisting anxiety? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
Randomised controlled trials (research trials in which participants are allocated according to a random sequence either to the intervention to be tested or to a comparator intervention). 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
This systematic review found three studies with a total of 319 participants with COPD and coexisting anxiety. All three studies assessed psychotherapy (CBT) with a co‐intervention, versus the co‐intervention alone. There was limited evidence showing some improvements in reduced levels of anxiety and improved quality of life in the psychotherapy group. It is important to note that the overall quality of the evidence was low and hence further research is needed to increase our confidence in this effect. A limitation of this review is that all three included studies recruited participants with both anxiety and depression, not just anxiety, which may confound the results.
