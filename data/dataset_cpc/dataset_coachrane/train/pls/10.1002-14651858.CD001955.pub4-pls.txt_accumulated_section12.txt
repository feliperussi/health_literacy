Glucocorticoids for croup in children
Review question 
We assessed the effectiveness of glucocorticoids for croup in children to determine if they reduced croup symptoms; minimised return visits to care; shortened length of stay; reduced the need for additional treatments; or had side effects. 
Background 
Croup causes the throat and windpipe to swell, resulting in hoarseness, a barking cough, and noisy breathing. Glucocorticoids can reduce swelling, making it easier to breathe.

Study characteristics 
We included 43 studies with 4565 children aged up to 18 years published from 1964 to 2013. The glucocorticoids investigated included beclomethasone, betamethasone, budesonide, dexamethasone, fluticasone, and prednisolone. Most studies (26, 60%) compared any glucocorticoid to placebo. Of these, 15 (58%) tested dexamethasone compared to placebo. Three studies compared 0.6 mg/kg to 0.15 mg/kg dosages of dexamethasone, a common clinical question. Half of the studies (22, 51%) described outpatients who presented to emergency departments or outpatient clinics, and 18 (42%) took place in North America, eight (19%) in Europe, seven (16%) in Asia, and 10 (23%) in Australia. Twenty‚Äêsix (60%) studies compared glucocorticoids to fake treatment (placebo); four (10%) compared glucocorticoids to epinephrine; 11 (26%) compared one glucocorticoid to another; three (7%) compared one glucocorticoid to a combination of glucocorticoids; five (12%) compared glucocorticoids given in different ways; and four (9%) compared glucocorticoids given in different amounts. 
Study funding sources 
Funding sources included government (12%), academic or research institute (7%), industry (19%), or foundations (7%). More than half of studies (56%) did not report funding sources.
