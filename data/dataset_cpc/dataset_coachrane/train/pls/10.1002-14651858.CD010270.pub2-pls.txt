Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain
Fentanyl patches placed on the skin produced good pain relief for most people with moderate or severe cancer pain. 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Morphine taken by mouth has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. Since that time a number of different drugs with morphine‐like actions have been produced for treating cancer pain, one of which is fentanyl. Fentanyl is particularly useful because it can be absorbed through the skin from patches. The ability of any drug to achieve consistent drug levels in the blood and the brain could, in theory, lead to better control of cancer pain. It also relieves the need to take medicines several times a day, as patches can often last for several days before changing. 
We found nine studies involving 1244 patients. The studies were often small, used different study designs, and compared fentanyl with many different drugs. Most patients had pain that went from moderate or severe before transdermal fentanyl to no worse than mild pain when using transdermal fentanyl. Only 3 in 10 patients were constipated using transdermal fentanyl compared with 5 in 10 using oral morphine. We could not analyse the data in a meaningful way regarding harmful (adverse) events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease processes. 
The effect of the patch can continue after it has been taken off due to medicine that has been taken up by the skin. Used patches need to be disposed of carefully. 
We could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels – no worse than mild pain – so that patients with cancer are not bothered by pain.
