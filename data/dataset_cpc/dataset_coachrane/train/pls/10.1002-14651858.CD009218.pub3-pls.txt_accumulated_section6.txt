Iron supplements taken one, two or three times a week for preventing anaemia, and its consequences in menstruating women 
What is the issue? 
Across the globe, approximately one out of three non‐pregnant women of reproductive age are anaemic; i.e. have fewer red blood cells or less haemoglobin (a red substance that combines with oxygen and carries it around the body) in each red blood cell than normal. Although there are several causes of anaemia, it very often results from sustained iron deficiency. The standard practice to prevent or treat anaemia in women has been daily iron supplementation (sometimes combined with folic acid and other vitamins and minerals) for three months. However, it is frequently associated with side effects such as nausea or constipation. Intermittent supplementation (that is, the consumption of supplements one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Why is this important? 
Women with anaemia may have less energy for physical work and become more prone to infections. Most women throughout the world enter pregnancy with anaemia, putting them at greater risk of having low birth‐weight babies and other complications during delivery. 
Some scientists believe that taking iron a few times a week – instead of every day – can help women with anaemia to feel better and improve their haemoglobin without giving them as many side effects. If women have fewer side effects, they may be more likely to take iron supplements more regularly and for longer periods.
