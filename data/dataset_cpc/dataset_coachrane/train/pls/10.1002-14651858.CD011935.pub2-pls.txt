Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin or mitomycin C for treatment of non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
In people with cancer of the inner lining of the bladder, how do two different medicines, that are called Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) and mitomycin (MMC), that are put into the bladder, after the tumour is taken out, compare? 
Background 
Tumours of the superficial layers of the bladder, so‐called non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer, are treated by putting small instruments into the bladder and shaving them out. This works well but these tumours often come back. When they do come back they can be more aggressive and advanced than before. Different types of medicines put into the bladder afterwards can make that happen less often, with BCG and MMC being those used most often. We are not sure how the two treatments compare when it comes to wanted and unwanted effects. 
Study characteristics 
The content of this review is current to September 2019. We included only studies where chance determined what treatment people in the study would get. 
Key results 
We found 12 studies including 2932 people who matched our question.
We found that BCG may lead to similar risk of dying from any cause over time (low‐quality evidence), but may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (low‐quality evidence), although it is possible that it does not make a difference. 
BCG may reduce the risk that the tumour comes back over time (low‐quality evidence), although it is possible that it does not make a difference. 
BCG may have little or no effect on the risk that the tumour gets worse over time (low‐quality evidence). 
We found no data on quality of life.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was consistently rated as low, meaning that our confidence is limited, and future research may change these findings.
