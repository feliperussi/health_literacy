Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers
Occupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. 
Key messages 
We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. 
What was studied in the review? 
We looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Introducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries.
