Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants) provided information for this review. In this trial, 35 participants underwent early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) and 40 participants underwent delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after an average waiting period of approximately four months. The treatment that the participants underwent was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin. This trial was at high risk of bias (systematic errors or errors in study design which may influence the conclusions). There were no deaths in the early group (0 out of 35) (0%) and there was one death (1 out of 40) (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. This difference between the groups was not significantly different. There were no serious complications related to the surgery in either group. During the waiting period, 9 out of 40 participants (22.5%) developed gallstone‚Äêrelated serious complications. Five participants in the delayed group revisited the hospital because of recurrent gallbladder pain. In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these participants were from the delayed group. All the participants in the early group were operated on within 24 hours. The proportion of participants who developed serious complications was significantly lower in the early group than the proportion of participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Quality of life and return to work were not reported in this trial. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who required conversion to open removal of the gallbladder. The hospital stay was significantly shorter (by about one day) in the early group than the delayed group. The operating time was significantly shorter (by about 15 minutes) in the early group than the delayed group.
