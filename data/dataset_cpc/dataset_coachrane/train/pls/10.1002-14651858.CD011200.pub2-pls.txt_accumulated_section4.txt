Different magnesium sulphate regimens given to mothers to prevent preterm labour
Babies born early ‐ before 37 weeks' estimated gestation ‐ are at an increased risk of dying or being seriously unwell, especially if they are born very early. Various drugs have been given to women to try and stop babies being born too soon. Magnesium sulphate has been one of the drugs used when women go into labour too early. 
Although it has now been shown that magnesium sulphate does not help prevent babies being born too soon, it is important to know the safest and best way to give magnesium sulphate if it is used for mothers in preterm labour. Particular concerns about high doses of magnesium sulphate for women in preterm labour, including increased risk of deaths of babies, have been raised. (Magnesium sulphate has been shown to help prevent and treat eclampsia in women with high blood pressure during pregnancy, and in mothers at risk of preterm birth, low doses can protect the baby's brain and improve long‐term outcomes for the infant. These uses are covered in other Cochrane reviews.) 
This review identified three trials (involving 360 women and their infants), but one trial did not provide any relevant data. The trials were small and were assessed as being at a low or unclear risk of bias. The trials did not report many outcomes of relevance to this review. We did find limited evidence to suggest that when magnesium sulphate was given to mothers in preterm labour, differences in the dose (high‐dose versus low‐dose) did not impact on the number of babies that died (very low quality evidence). There were no data to assess other important outcomes: birth less than 48 hours after entry to the trial, or serious outcomes for mothers or their babies.
