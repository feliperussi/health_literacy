What are the benefits and risks of corticosteroids for preventing inflammation in children who undergo heart surgery involving a heart‐lung machine? 
Why is this question important? 
Children who are born with a heart defect, or who develop heart disease after birth, may need heart surgery. To operate, surgeons often need to stop the heart and lungs temporarily. To keep the child alive, they use a heart‐lung machine that takes over the work of the heart and lungs. The machine adds oxygen to the blood, removes carbon dioxide from it, and pumps the blood back into the child’s body. 
We know that heart surgery involving a heart‐lung machine causes inflammation across the body. This can cause complications ranging from low blood pressure to major organ dysfunction. In some cases, patients may die. 
Corticosteroids (a type of anti‐inflammation medicine) have been widely used to prevent inflammation in children who undergo heart surgery that requires a heart‐lung machine, but their benefits and risks are unclear. To find out whether they prevent inflammation, and whether they are associated with any unwanted effects (such as poor wound healing, increased risk of infection or increased risk of death), we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomized controlled studies (studies in which people are randomly divided into different treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty.
