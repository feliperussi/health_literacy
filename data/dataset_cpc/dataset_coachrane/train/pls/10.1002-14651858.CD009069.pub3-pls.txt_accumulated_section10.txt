HPV vaccination to prevent cancer and pre‐cancerous changes of the cervix
Background Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Usually they are cleared by the immune system. However, when high‐risk (hr) types persist, they can cause the development of abnormal cervical cells, which are referred to as cervical precancer if at least two thirds of the surface layer of the cervix is affected. Precancer can develop into cervical cancer after several years. Not everyone who has cervical precancer goes on to develop cervical cancer, but predicting who will is difficult. There are a number of different hrHPV types which can cause cervical precancer and cancer. HPV16 and 18 are the most important high‐risk types, since they cause about 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. Preventive vaccination, by injection of HPV virus‐like particles in the muscle, triggers the production of antibodies which protect against future HPV infections. 
Review question Does HPV vaccination prevent the development of cervical precancer or cancer and what are the harms? 
Main results We included 26 studies involving 73,428 adolescent girls and women. All trials evaluated vaccine safety over a period 0.5 to 7 years and ten trials, with follow‐up 3.5 to 8 years, addressed protection against precancer. Cervical cancer outcomes are not available. Most participants enrolled were younger than 26 years of age. Three trials recruited women between 25 to 45 years. The studies compared HPV vaccine with a dummy vaccine. 
We assessed protection against precancer in individuals who were free of hrHPV, free of HPV16/18 or those with or without HPV infection at the time of vaccination. We separately assessed precancer associated with HPV16/18 and any precancer. 
Protection against cervical precancer  
1) Women free of hrHPV 
Outcomes were only measured in the younger age group for this comparison (15 to 25 years). HPV vaccines reduce the risk of cervical precancer associated with HPV16/18 from 164 to 2/10,000 women (high certainty). They reduce also any precancer from 287 to 106/10,000 (high certainty). 
2) Women free of HPV16/18 
The effect of HPV vaccines on risk of precancer differ by age group. In younger women, HPV vaccines reduce the risk of precancer associated with HPV16/18 from 113 to 6/10,000 women (high certainty). HPV vaccines lower the number of women with any precancer from 231 to 95/10,000 (high certainty). In women older than 25, the vaccines reduce the number with precancer associated with HPV16/18 from 45 to 14/10,000 (moderate certainty).
