Methadone (an opioid drug) for treating people with cancer pain
Bottom line 
Methadone taken by mouth provided good pain relief for most adults with moderate or severe cancer pain. 
Background 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. Methadone has been used for many years as one of a number of different pain killers for cancer pain. 
Study characteristics 
In this updated review we set out to estimate how well methadone worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were â€“ for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their methadone. 
In May 2016, we found just six studies with 388 adult participants. The studies were often small, and compared different preparations. 
Key findings 
For pain relief there did not seem to be much difference between methadone and morphine. For most people pain was reduced from moderate or severe to mild or no pain with methadone. Methadone is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly sleepiness, constipation, and dry mouth. These can be severe enough to stop people taking methadone. No data were available about the use of methadone in children. 
We would like to see more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include information on unwanted effects and the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels, that is, no worse than mild pain, so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain.
