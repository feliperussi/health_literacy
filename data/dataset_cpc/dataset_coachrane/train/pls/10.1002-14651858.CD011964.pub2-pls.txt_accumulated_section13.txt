What is the accuracy of different combinations of ultrasound imaging and blood tests to diagnose ovarian cancer in women before and after the menopause? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of ovarian cancer important? 
Many women diagnosed with ovarian cancer (OC) die from the disease, because it has usually spread outside the tubes/ovaries at the time of diagnosis. Missing OC (a false‐negative result) may need major surgery and a lower chance of survival. An incorrect diagnosis of OC (a false‐positive result) may result in anxiety, unnecessary further tests and surgery. 
What did we aim to do? 
We aimed to find out how accurate ultrasounds and blood tests are for diagnosing OC in premenopausal women and postmenopausal women. 
What did we study? 
We included 59 studies that compared four tests: Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) (ultrasound and CA125 blood test); Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) (CA125 and HE4 blood tests); the IOTA Logistic Regression model 2 (LR2) ultrasound and the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa model (ADNEX) (CA125 blood test and ultrasound). 
What were the main results? 
Premenopausal women 
The sensitivities (proportion of women with OC correctly identified) of ROMA (77.4%), LR2 (83.3%) and ADNEX (95.5%) are higher than RMI (57.2%). 
The specificities (proportion of women without OC correctly identified) of ROMA (84.3%) and ADNEX (77.8%) were lower than RMI (92.5%) and LR2 (90.4%). 
The results indicate that if these tests were to be used in hospital settings in a group of 1000 premenopausal women, of whom 30 (3%) actually have OC: 
– for RMI 13 women, for ROMA 7 women, for LR2 5 women and for ADNEX 1 woman would have their cancer missed by the test (false‐negative result);
