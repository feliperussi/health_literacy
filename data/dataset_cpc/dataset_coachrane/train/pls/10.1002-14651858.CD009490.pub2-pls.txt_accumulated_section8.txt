Support surfaces for treating pressure ulcers
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether different support surfaces such as specially‐designed beds, mattresses or cushions can help to treat pressure ulcers. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question, and found 19 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain which support surfaces are most effective for pressure ulcer treatment as the studies comparing them did not involve enough people and were not well designed. 
What was studied in the review? 
Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by pressure or rubbing. They typically form at points on the body which are bony or which bear weight or pressure, such as the hips, buttocks, heels and elbows. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. A range of treatments, including wound dressings and support surfaces like special mattresses and cushions, are used to treat pressure ulcers. 
Support surfaces for pressure ulcer treatment can include specially‐designed beds, mattresses, mattress overlays and cushions that are used to protect vulnerable parts of the body and distribute the surface pressure more evenly. Low‐tech support surfaces include mattresses filled with foam, fluid, beads or air; and alternative foam mattresses and overlays. High‐tech support surfaces include mattresses and overlays that are electrically powered to alternate the pressure within the surface, beds that are powered to have air mechanically circulated within them and low‐air‐loss beds that contain warm air moving within pockets inside the bed. Other support surfaces include sheepskins, cushions and operating table overlays.
