Does preconception lifestyle advice help people with infertility to have a baby?
BackgroundInfertility places a significant burden on individuals, families, and the wider community and impacts more than 45 million couples worldwide. Treatment for infertility includes simple interventions such as fertility awareness and lifestyle advice (counselling about weight, diet, physical activity, and/or smoking) to more complex assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Lifestyle factors such as weight, diet, physical activity, and smoking may affect fertility and the chance of people with infertility having a baby. However, guidelines about what preconception lifestyle advice should be offered are lacking. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out the effects of preconception lifestyle advice compared to routine care or attention control (e.g. treatment advice without lifestyle advice) for people with infertility. 
What we did We searched for randomised controlled studies that compared preconception lifestyle advice for people with infertility with routine care or attention control. 
We were interested in finding out what preconception lifestyle advice should be given to people with infertility; how well it works for improving lifestyle to increase their chance of having a baby; and whether it had any unwanted effects. 
Search date We included evidence published up to 14 January 2021. 
What we foundWe found seven studies in 2130 people with infertility. Only one study also included male partners. The studies were conducted in Canada, Iran, The Netherlands, UK, and USA. Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control. Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care in women with infertility and specific lifestyle characteristics.
