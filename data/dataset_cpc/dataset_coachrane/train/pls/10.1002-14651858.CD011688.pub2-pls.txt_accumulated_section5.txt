Fluoxetine for overweight or obese adults
Review questionWhat are the effects of fluoxetine treatment in overweight or obese adults? 
BackgroundFluoxetine is a medicine used for the treatment of depression, which reduces appetite as a side effect. Therefore, it is suspected that fluoxetine could be used as a treatment for overweight or obese people. In this group of people administration of fluoxetine means an off‐label treatment which means it is not licensed for treating obesity. 
Study characteristicsWe found 19 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) evaluating mainly women receiving different doses of fluoxetine. A total of 1280 overweight or obese participants received fluoxetine and 936 participants received mainly placebo or another anti‐obesity medication. The participants in the included studies were followed up for periods varying between three weeks and one year. 
Key resultsFor our main comparison group — fluoxetine compared with placebo — and for all fluoxetine doses there was a 2.7 kg weight loss in favour of fluoxetine. We are uncertain, however, if an additional study would again show a benefit for fluoxetine. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced a side effect. Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often after fluoxetine compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The studies did not report on death from any cause, health‐related quality of life and socioeconomic effects.
