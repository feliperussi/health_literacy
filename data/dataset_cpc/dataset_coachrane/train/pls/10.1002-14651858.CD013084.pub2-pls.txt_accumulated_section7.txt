Intravenous iron for the treatment of non‐anaemic iron deficiency in adults
Background 
Iron deficiency, when the body does not have enough of the mineral iron, is a common, nutritional deficiency. Iron is used by the body to make haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen around the body. Whilst iron deficiency is most commonly associated with a low level of haemoglobin in the blood (anaemia), early, or 'non‐anaemic' iron deficiency can also lead to symptoms such as tiredness and lack of energy. Non‐anaemic iron deficiency is often treated with oral iron, which is medicine taken by mouth, such as iron tablets. However, oral iron is likely to cause side effects, is not effective for certain types of iron deficiency, and takes time to work fully. In addition, newer iron preparations, such as intravenous iron, are more stable, have fewer side effects and have maximum benefit in a shorter time period. 
Aim of the review 
To review the evidence from randomised controlled trials (where people are allocated a treatment at random) on the safety and effects of intravenous iron in the treatment of early, or non‐anaemic iron deficiency. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies with 1074 participants. A broad range of people were included in these studies, including people with heart failure, elite athletes, people with restless legs syndrome and otherwise fit and well women. We excluded studies that looked at children, pregnant women, and people being treated with erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells).
