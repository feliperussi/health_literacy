Surgery for Dupuytren's disease of the fingers
Review question 
We conducted a review of the effects of surgery for people with Dupuytren’s disease of the fingers and found 13 studies with 940 participants; 93 participants were reported twice in separate articles describing early and late outcomes of one trial. 
Background 
Dupuytren's disease is common. Patients develop scar‐like tissue under the palmar skin of the hand that draws their fingers into the palm and can affect function. 
This condition can be surgically treated by cutting out the disease, then stitching the skin back into place (fasciectomy) or replacing it with a graft of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (dermofasciectomy). Alternative approaches involve breaking the cord of disease to straighten the finger. This can be done by moving a needle back and forth through the cord until it snaps, as when rubbing a rope repeatedly over a rock (needle fasciotomy), or by injecting into it an enzyme that digests a piece of the cord (collagenase). This weakens one spot, allowing the surgeon to snap the cord and straighten the finger. As the condition is related in part to genetics, it tends to come back, even after successful treatment. As the latter two treatments leave the broken ends of the cord behind, recurrence may be quicker after these procedures than after traditional excisional surgery. However, recovery might also be quicker. The most effective treatment is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
After searching for all relevant studies up to May 2015, we found 13 studies (14 articles) that met our inclusion criteria. However, only three compared different operation types. The others compared aspects of one operation type. One study presented early and late outcomes.
