Interventions for treating acute elbow dislocations in adults
Elbow dislocation is where the joint surfaces of the elbow become completely separated from each other. It is a relatively uncommon injury. After the bones of the elbow joint are put back into place, under sedation and/or anaesthesia, the arm is usually immobilised in a cast for a week or more. Removal of the cast is often followed by physical therapy aimed at restoring elbow mobility. Surgery is usually reserved for the more severe dislocations, which are generally associated with a fracture (broken bone). 
This review includes two trials, involving a total of 80 adults with simple elbow dislocations that had been put back into place (reduced). Both trials were at risk of bias, which means that their results may not be reliable. 
One trial compared early mobilisation of the elbow with immobilisation for three weeks in a plaster cast. This trial found no firm evidence of differences between the two interventions in the recovery of elbow range of motion or pain at one year. None of the trial participants had an unstable elbow or had suffered another dislocation. 
The other trial compared surgical repair of the torn ligaments versus conservative treatment (cast immobilisation for two weeks). It found no significant difference between the two groups in the numbers of patients who considered their injured elbow to be inferior to their non‐injured elbow or in other patient complaints about their elbow such as weakness, pain or weather‐related discomfort. There were also no differences between the groups in the range of motion of the elbow or grip strength at follow‐up of around two years. There were two people with surgery‐related complications. None of the trial participants had an unstable elbow or had suffered another dislocation. 
Overall, the review concluded that there was not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to show which methods of treatment are better for these injuries.
