Minimally invasive treatments to dissolve blood clots in the lungs (acute pulmonary embolism) 
Background 
What is acute pulmonary embolism? 
Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a major cause of death and illness in people in hospital. APE occurs when a piece of blood clot (the embolus) breaks off from a blood clot elsewhere in the body (deep vein thrombosis) and travels in the blood to the lungs. The embolus gets stuck in the lung blood vessel(s), and the consequences range from no symptoms to sudden death. The risk of dying from APE can be classified by clinical assessment, along with specialised medical imaging and blood tests. The risk of death determines what treatment the affected person should receive.  
How is acute pulmonary embolism treated?  
The main treatment for APE is blood thinning medications (anticoagulation). This stops new blood clots from forming whilst the body slowly dissolves the clot, but does not get rid of the blood clot. People with high‐risk (massive) APE are so ill that an additional clot‐busting medicine (thrombolytic) is recommended – as well as anticoagulation – to save their lives. The thrombolytic is usually given via a drip into an arm vein (systemic thrombolysis). The thrombolytic circulates in the blood to the lungs and dissolves the clot. Unfortunately, most people do not receive systemic thrombolysis because they have a risk factor (such as recent surgery), which makes the risk of major bleeding after receiving the thrombolytic too great. Systemic thrombolysis does not work in 8% of people who receive it, so they need another dose or an alternative treatment. Surgery for APE is an alternative rescue treatment, but it is not widely available.
