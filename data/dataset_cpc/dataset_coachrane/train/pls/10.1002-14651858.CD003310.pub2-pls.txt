Does supplementation of human milk with calcium and phosphorus improve growth and development in preterm infants? 
What is the issue? 
When babies are born too early (preterm), they have very low stores of the minerals calcium and phosphorus needed for healthy bones and growth. Human milk may not contain sufficient minerals for these babies. 
Why is this important? 
Calcium and phosphorus are essential for healthy bones and normal growth and development. When a baby is born preterm and does not receive enough calcium and phosphorus, bone fractures and poor growth can occur. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in April 2016 and identified one randomised controlled trial including 40 babies. Investigators reported a small decrease in the concentration of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme involved in bone growth) among infants who had received calcium/phosphorus supplementation. We found no difference in growth between infants who had been given human milk supplemented with extra calcium and phosphorus and infants who had received no supplementation. One small trial provided the evidence, and we judged the evidence to be of low quality. Researchers reported no follow‐up of these babies into childhood. 
What does this mean? 
Evidence is insufficient to allow a judgement as to whether extra calcium and/or phosphorus provided to preterm babies confers benefit for their bones and growth. It is no longer very common to give calcium and phosphorus supplements alone, as human milk fortifiers now available include many other components as well as minerals to support the growth and development of preterm babies. We therefore suggest that future trials conducted to examine effects of mineral supplements in preterm babies include them in multi‐component human milk fortifiers and assess clinically important outcomes into childhood.
