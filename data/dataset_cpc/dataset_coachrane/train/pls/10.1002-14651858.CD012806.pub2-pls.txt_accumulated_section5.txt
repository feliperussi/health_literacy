How good are ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT for identifying spread of disease in the body among people with melanoma? 
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out which imaging tests are better for identifying spread of disease among people with a first diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) and among people with possible recurrence of melanoma (re‐staging). We looked at the evidence for ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT and included 39 studies to answer these questions. 
Why are imaging tests for melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with potential for metastases (cancer cells) to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs of the body. To make sure that people with melanoma receive the most appropriate and effective treatment, it is important to identify whether the disease has spread and to which parts of the body it has spread. This is called 'staging of disease'. Staging is done to find out if a melanoma has spread to regional lymph nodes or to lymph nodes close to the original melanoma, and to determine if the melanoma has spread to lymph nodes in other parts of the body or to organs of the body such as the liver or the brain (distant metastases). Imaging tests are tools that can be used to help find out how much the disease has spread. Several new treatments are now available for reducing the risk of spread of melanoma and for treating melanoma when it has spread.
