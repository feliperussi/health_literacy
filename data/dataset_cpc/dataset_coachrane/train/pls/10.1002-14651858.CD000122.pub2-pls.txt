Early light reduction for preventing retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight infants 
Retinopathy of prematurity (a common retinal neovascular disorder of premature infants) is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. The cause of advanced retinopathy of prematurity and the way the disease develops are not fully understood. In the past many factors, such as the use of supplemental oxygen, excessive light exposure and hypoxia (lack of oxygen), have been suggested as possible causes. Light exposure has been investigated because experimental studies have demonstrated that intensive lighting can result in irreversible damage to the retina. However, the clinical studies conducted to date have shown conflicting results in terms of the effects of light in the development of the disease. Furthermore, studies have concluded that reduction of light exposure does not reduce the progression of retinopathy of prematurity. 
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of early light reduction to prevent retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight infants. We selected randomised controlled trials (a specific type of scientific experiment to test the efficacy and/or effectiveness of various types of medical intervention within a patient population). Four studies (seven publications) with a reasonable methodological quality were included with a total of 897 participants. The evidence shows that bright light is not the cause of retinopathy of prematurity and that the reduction of exposure of the retinas of premature infants to light has no effect on the incidence of the disease. This evidence is up to October 2012.
