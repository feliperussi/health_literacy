Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard cut (open) abdominal surgery for people with food‐pipe (oesophageal) cancer 
Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare to standard (open) abdominal surgery for people with food‐pipe (oesophageal) cancer? 
Background 
The oesophagus (food pipe) is located mainly in the chest; it enters the abdomen (tummy) through an opening in the diaphragm (muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen). Removing tumours by surgery (oesophagectomy) is one of the recommended treatments for cancers that are limited to the oesophagus. The tumour can be removed through an abdominal opening, a chest opening, or a combination. When the tumour is removed through an abdominal opening, it is called transhiatal oesophagectomy (as the oesophagus is separated from its surrounding structures through the opening in the diaphragm). The abdominal surgery can be performed through either a key‐hole or a standard cut. Key‐hole surgery to remove oesophageal cancer (laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy) is a relatively new procedure compared to the well‐established standard cut surgery (open transhiatal oesophagectomy). In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stays compared to open surgery. 
However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic surgery. How do complications after operation (post‐operative complications) compare between the two procedures? Does laparoscopic surgery remove the same amount of cancer and healthy border tissue as open surgery? Do people recovery more quickly after laparoscopic or open surgery? We sought to resolve these issues by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic.
