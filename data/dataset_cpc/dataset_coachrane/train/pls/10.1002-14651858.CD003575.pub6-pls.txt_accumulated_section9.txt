Treatments for collagenous colitis
What is collagenous colitis? 
Collagenous colitis is a type of microscopic colitis, a condition characterized by chronic watery non‐bloody diarrhea. People with collagenous colitis have a normal appearing bowel when assessed by an endoscope (a camera used to look at the bowel); but have microscopic inflammation of the bowel when assessed by a biopsy (a tissue sample taken during endoscopy). The cause of this disorder is unknown. 
What treatments have been tried for lymphocytic colitis? 
Budesonide, mesalamine, cholestyramine, Boswellia serrata extract, probiotics, prednisolone and Pepto‐Bismol® have been studied as treatment for collagenous colitis. Budesonide is an immunosuppressive steroid drug that is quickly metabolized by the liver resulting in reduced steroid‐related side‐effects. Prednisolone is a steroid drug used to treat inflammation. Mesalamine (also known as 5‐ASA) is an anti‐inflammatory drug. Cholestyramine is a drug that helps the body remove bile acids. Pepto‐Bismol®, is an antacid medication used to treat discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Boswellia serrata extract is a herbal extract. Probiotics are found in yogurt or dietary supplements and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers investigated whether these treatments improve symptoms (e.g. diarrhea) or microscopic inflammation of collagenous colitis and whether any side effects (harms) result from treatment. The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to 7 November 2016. 
What did the researchers find? 
Twelve studies (476 participants) were identified. Four studies were high quality. One study assessing mesalamine and cholestyramine was judged to be low quality and the other studies were judged to be of unclear quality due to poor reporting of methods.
