Massage, reflexology and other manual methods for managing pain in labour
What is the issue? 
This Cochrane review looked at whether massage, reflexology and other manual therapies would help with reducing pain and improve women's experiences of childbirth. We collected and analysed all the relevant trials to answer this question (search date: 30 June 2017). 
Why is this important? 
The pain of labour can be intense, with tension, anxiety and fear making it worse. Many women would like to labour without using drugs such as narcotics or epidurals, and are interested in complementary therapies to help them manage the pain of labour. 
In this review we have looked to see if massage, reflexology and other manual methods are effective. Other complementary therapies like acupuncture, mind‚Äêbody techniques, hypnosis and aromatherapy have been studied in other Cochrane reviews. Massage involves manipulating the body's soft tissues and it can be done by the midwife or partner. It helps women relax and so reduces tension which in turn may reduce pain in labour. Reflexology is gentle manipulation or pressing on certain parts of the foot to produce an effect elsewhere in the body. Other manual methods include warm packs, osteopathy, shiatsu and zero balancing. It is important to examine if these therapies work and are safe, to enable women to make informed decisions about their care. 
What evidence did we find? 
This updated review now includes 14 trials. We were able to use data from 10 of the trials, involving a total of 1055 women. We found no trials on reflexology, osteopathy, shiatsu and zero balancing therapy.
