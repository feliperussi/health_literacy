Women should be aware of their true risk of developing breast cancer and the limitations of current evidence when considering risk‐reducing mastectomy 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether risk‐reducing mastectomy (RRM) reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast. Also, we reviewed the effect of RRM on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease‐free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. 
Background 
Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer and widely publicized reports of celebrities undergoing RRM have increased interest in it as a method of preventing breast cancer. 
Study characteristics 
Sixty‐one studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for developing breast cancer, who underwent RRM. Risk‐reducing mastectomy could include either surgically removing both breasts to prevent breast cancer (bilateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or BRRM), or removing the disease‐free breast in women who have had breast cancer in one breast to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in the other breast (contralateral risk‐reducing mastectomy or CRRM). The evidence is current to July 2016. 
Key results 
The BRRM studies reported that it reduced the incidence of breast cancer or the number of deaths or both, but many of the studies have methodological limitations. After BRRM, most women are satisfied with their decision, but reported less satisfaction with cosmetic results, body image, and sexual feelings. One of the complications of RRM was the need for additional unanticipated surgeries, particularly in women undergoing reconstruction after RRM. However, most women also experienced reduced worry of developing and dying from breast cancer along with diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings
