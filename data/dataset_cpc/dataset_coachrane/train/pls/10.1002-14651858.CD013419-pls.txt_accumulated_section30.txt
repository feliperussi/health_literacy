Flexibility exercise training for adults with fibromyalgia
This review summarizes the effects of flexibility exercise for adults with fibromyalgia.
What problems do fibromyalgia cause? 
People with fibromyalgia have persistent, widespread body pain. They may also have fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. 
What is flexibility exercise training? 
Flexibility exercise training is a type of exercise that focuses on improving or maintaining the amount of motion available in muscles and joint structures by holding or stretching the body in specific positions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to December 2017 and found 12 studies (743 individuals) that met our inclusion criteria. Flexibility interventions were compared with control (treatment as usual), aerobic training interventions (e.g. treadmill walking), resistance‐training interventions (e.g. using weight machines that provide resistance to movement), and other interventions (e.g. Pilates). The average age of participants was 48.6 years. Trials were conducted in seven countries, and most studies (58.3%) included only female participants. Exercise trials ranged from 4 to 20 weeks. The stretching exercise programs ranged from 40 to 60 minutes, 1 to 3 times a day. The intensity of the stretches (e.g. how far the stretch was taken in the available range of motion) was not reported in most cases. The time each stretch was held ranged from 6 to 60 seconds. The targeted muscles were usually of both the upper and lower extremities, neck, and back. The flexibility training was either supervised or done at home. Our main comparison was flexibility exercise versus land‐based aerobic training. 
Key results at the end of treatment for our main comparison 
Compared with land‐based aerobic exercise training, flexibility exercise resulted in little benefit at 8 to 20 weeks' follow‐up. 
Each measure below was measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower scores better.
Health‐related quality of life: People who received flexibility exercise training were 4% worse (ranging from 6% better to 14% worse). 
• People who had flexibility training rated their quality of life as 46 points.
• People who had aerobic training rated their quality of life as 42 points.
Pain intensity: People who received flexibility exercise training were 5% worse (ranging from 1% better to 11% worse). 
• People who had flexibility training rated their pain as 57 points.
• People who had aerobic training rated their pain as 52 points.
Fatigue: People who received flexibility exercise training were 4% better (ranging from 13% better to 5% worse). 
• People who had flexibility training rated their fatigue as 67 points.
• People who had aerobic training rated their fatigue as 71 points.
Stiffness: People who received flexibility exercise training were 30% better (ranging from 8% better to 51% better). 
• People who had flexibility training rated their stiffness as 49 points.
• People who had aerobic training rated their stiffness as 79 points.
Physical function: People who received flexibility exercise training were 6% worse (ranging from 4% better to 16% worse). 
• People who had flexibility training rated their physical function as 23 points.
• People who had aerobic training rated their physical function as 17 points.
Withdrawal from treatment 
A total of 18 per 100 people dropped out of the flexibility exercise training group for any reason compared to 19 per 100 people from the aerobic training group. 
Harms 
We found no clear information on harms. One study reported that one participant had swelling (tendinitis) of an ankle tendon (Achilles), but it is unclear if this was related to participation in the flexibility exercise.
