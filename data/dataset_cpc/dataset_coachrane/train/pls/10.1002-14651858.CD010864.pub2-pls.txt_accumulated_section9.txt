D‐dimer for excluding pulmonary embolism in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency populations 
Review question 
To investigate the ability of the D‐dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) departments. 
Background 
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious, potentially fatal condition that occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs. When people arrive to hospital A&E departments reporting difficulty breathing, breathlessness and chest pain, several explanations are possible but a quick diagnosis is needed. Tests that are available to detect blood clots in the lungs can be invasive and time‐consuming, can carry a radiation burden and may be costly. Quick, easy‐to‐use and inexpensive tests that can be used to rule out the diagnosis would be very valuable. 
One such test is the D‐dimer test, which is so named because it detects small pieces of protein in the blood, which are called D‐dimer. When someone with symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain arrives to the hospital A&E department, the staff conducts an examination and asks questions about the patient's medical history and lifestyle. This helps them to calculate a score for the patient's risk that symptoms are due to a PE. 
If the score shows that they are at high risk of a blood clot in the lungs, patients undergo diagnostic scanning immediately (or are treated while test results are awaited). A D‐dimer test can be ordered for people in low or moderate (or unlikely) risk groups; a negative D‐dimer result might rule out the diagnosis of PE without the need for imaging. 
Study characteristics 
This review considered all evidence provided by studies that assess the ability of D‐dimer to rule out PE in people attending hospital outpatient and A&E departments.
