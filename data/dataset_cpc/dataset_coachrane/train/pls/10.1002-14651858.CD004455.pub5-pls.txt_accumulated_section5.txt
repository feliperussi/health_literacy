Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective or safe for women undergoing operative vaginal delivery? 
We set out to assess from randomised controlled studies whether giving antibiotics to all women undergoing operative vaginal deliveries prevents infections in the mother without increasing adverse outcomes in the mother and baby. Vacuum extraction or forceps are used to deliver the baby’s head in operative vaginal deliveries. 
What is the issue? 
Women who undergo vacuum‐ or forceps‐assisted vaginal births may be more likely to have an infection after the birth when compared to women who experience a normal spontaneous vaginal birth. They are also more likely to be re‐admitted to hospital. Women are at increased risk of infection because of the need for routine bladder catheterisation, multiple vaginal examinations, insertion of instruments into the vagina, and increased risk of vaginal deep cuts or tears during the operative birth. Infection appears as fever, infection of the uterus and surrounding tissues, an infected episiotomy or vaginal tear, or urinary tract infection. These affect the physical state of the mother and can impact on her well‐being. The infection may also enter the bloodstream and affect the whole body. 
Why is this important? Vacuum extraction or forceps are used to shorten labour from the time when the cervix is fully opened to birth (second stage of labour), particularly if this is long or the baby shows signs of distress. Antibiotics can be given to mothers at the time of birth to prevent or reduce the risk of infection. However, there are still some doubts about the benefit of such antibiotics. Antibiotics can also cause adverse reactions such as rash or diarrhoea in the mother, and may be present in breast milk so that a breastfeeding baby is exposed to them.
