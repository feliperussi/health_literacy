For most outcomes across the different chronic diseases we only included one study with a small number of participants. In adults with asthma, we do not know whether pine bark extract increases lung function, improves asthma symptoms or increases the number of people able to stop using albuterol inhalers (a specific type of asthma pump).In children with ADHD, we do not know whether pine bark supplements decrease inattention and hyperactivity (assessed by parents and teachers) or whether it increases co‐ordination and concentration.In people with heart disease we do not know if pine bark supplements decrease blood pressure and LDL cholesterol (the bad type) or whether it increases HDL cholesterol (the good type).In adults with chronic venous insufficiency we do not know whether pine bark supplements decrease pain, increase the number of people free of pain, or how well doctors think the treatment works. In people with type 2 diabetes, we do not know whether pine bark supplements improve blood sugar levels or HbA1c levels (the long‐term marker for measuring blood sugar control); we also do not know if pine bark supplements decrease HbA1c in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.In men with erectile dysfunction, we do not know if pine bark supplements increase erectile function. Similarly, in women with sexual dysfunction, we do not know if pine bark supplements increase sexual satisfaction or reduce pain.In adults with osteoarthritis, it is not clear if pine bark supplements improve pain, swelling or stiffness in the knee, or whether it decreases the use of anti‐inflammatory drugs. We also do not know if pine bark supplements increase bone formation in postmenopausal women with weakened bones. Lastly, in people with a traumatic brain injury, it is not clear if pine bark supplements improve memory and post‐concussion symptoms .
