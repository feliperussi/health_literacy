Colloids or crystalloids for fluid replacement in critically people
Background 
Critically ill people may lose large amounts of blood (because of trauma or burns), or have serious conditions or infections (e.g. sepsis); they require additional fluids urgently to prevent dehydration or kidney failure. Colloids and crystalloids are types of fluids that are used for fluid replacement, often intravenously (via a tube straight into the blood). 
Crystalloids are low‐cost salt solutions (e.g. saline) with small molecules, which can move around easily when injected into the body. 
Colloids can be man‐made (e.g. starches, dextrans, or gelatins), or naturally occurring (e.g. albumin or fresh frozen plasma (FFP)), and have bigger molecules, so stay in the blood for longer before passing to other parts of the body. Colloids are more expensive than crystalloids. We are uncertain whether they are better than crystalloids at reducing death, need for blood transfusion or need for renal replacement therapy (filtering the blood, with or without dialysis machines, if kidneys fail) when given to critically ill people who need fluid replacement. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to February 2018. We searched the medical literature and identified 69 relevant studies with 30,020 critically ill participants who were given fluid replacement in hospital or in an emergency out‐of‐hospital setting. Studies compared colloids (starches; dextrans; gelatins; or albumin or FFP) with crystalloids. 
Key results 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that using colloids (starches; dextrans; or albumin or FFP) compared to crystalloids for fluid replacement probably makes little or no difference to the number of critically ill people who die within 30 or 90 days, or by the end of study follow‐up. We also found low‐certainty evidence that using gelatins or crystalloids may make little or no difference to the number of deaths within each of these time points.
