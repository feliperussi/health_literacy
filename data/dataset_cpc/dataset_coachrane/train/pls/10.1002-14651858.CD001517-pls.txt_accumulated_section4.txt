Ropinirole versus bromocriptine for levodopa‐induced complications in Parkinson's disease 
In the later stages of Parkinson's disease, side effects occur because of the use of levodopa treatment. These consist of involuntary writhing movements (dyskinesia), painful cramps in the legs (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose referred to as 'end‐of‐dose deterioration' or the 'wearing‐off effect'. Dopamine agonist drugs act by mimicking dopamine in the brain, but they do not cause these long‐term treatment complications. For this reason, dopamine agonists have for some years been added once these problems develop in the hope of improving them. Ropinirole is a new dopamine agonist recently licensed in the UK for the treatment of early and later Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will examine the trials performed with this drug to see how it compares with one of the older agonists bromocriptine. 
Three trials have compared ropinirole with bromocriptine in 482 patients in the later stages of Parkinson's disease. Two studies were conducted over the short term (8 and 16 weeks), and used relatively low doses of ropinirole (9 mg/d) and bromocriptine (17.5 and 22.5mg/d). The other study was medium term (25 weeks) and used ropinirole doses in line with the current UK licensed maximum (24 mg/d). 
No significant differences were found between the agonists in the time patients spent in the immobile off state, in dyskinesia reported as a side effect, in measurements of physical difficulties and problems with activities of daily living (such as bathing, shopping, etc.), or in levodopa dose reduction. No differences in side effects or withdrawals from treatment were found apart from less nausea with ropinirole.
