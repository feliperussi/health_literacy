Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy versus bilateral neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in adults 
Review question 
Is minimally invasive parathyroidectomy a better surgical treatment compared to classic bilateral neck exploration for people with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism? 
Background 
Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the four parathyroid glands (pea‐sized glands located behind or in the thyroid gland in the neck) may enlarge and produce excess parathyroid hormone, a hormone that normally controls calcium and bone metabolism. Excess production of parathyroid hormone results in high blood calcium levels as calcium is drawn out of bones, resulting in increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bones) and kidney stones. The word 'primary' means that this disorder originates in parathyroid glands and is mostly due to a benign excessive growth of parathyroid cells. Most but not all people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. Surgery to remove the diseased parathyroid gland(s) (called parathyroidectomy) is the first‐line therapy for people who develop symptoms, namely fractures and kidney stones. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is a shorter simpler procedure that uses scans to identify the diseased glands with potentially lower complication risk than bilateral neck exploration (where both sided of the neck are explored to identify which of the four glands are diseased). 
Study characteristics 
We identified five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) enrolling a total of 266 adults with primary hyperparathyroidism, who were assigned to one of two surgical techniques (136 participants to the minimally invasive parathyroidectomy group and 130 to the bilateral neck exploration group). One of the studies followed up participants up to five years, but the rest reported data until one year.
