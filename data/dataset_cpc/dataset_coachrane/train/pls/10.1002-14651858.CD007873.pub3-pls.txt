Using a cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth
Giving birth before term contributes to more than half of the deaths of newborn babies. Weakness of the cervix (the neck of the womb) and multiple pregnancy are common risk factors. Different management techniques have been tried including tightening the cervix with a stitch (cervical cerclage) to prevent its premature opening. Although it is a simple operation, cervical cerclage is invasive requiring anaesthesia and can have bleeding complications and cause infection and pregnancy loss. There is also controversy regarding the efficacy of cervical cerclage and the women who benefit most from this operation. Closing the cervix with a silicone ring (cervical pessary) that is removed at around 37 weeks is a simple, less invasive procedure that does not require anaesthesia and might replace the cervical stitch operation. To date, data obtained from one well‐designed randomised clinical trial suggest that inserting a cervical pessary is superior to expectant management in the prevention of preterm birth in 385 women between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal paediatric care admission was reduced in the pessary group in comparison to the expectant group. These women had a singleton pregnancy and high risk of preterm birth because of the short length of the neck of the womb (cervix). Among the pessary group, 27 women needed pessary repositioning without removal and there was one case of pessary removal. Results of both the randomised trial and non‐randomised trials show that pessary users complained of increased vaginal discharge. More studies are needed in different settings, with singleton and multiple pregnancies where the weakness of the cervix is from other causes, to confirm the results of the single trial included in this review. Some studies are ongoing.
