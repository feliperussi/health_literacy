Oral dextrose gel for the treatment of newborn infants with low blood glucose levels
Review question 
For newborn infants who develop low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia), is sugar gel given by mouth (oral dextrose gel) more effective than no treatment or other active treatments in correcting the low blood glucose level and reducing long‐term neurodevelopmental impairment? 
Background 
Low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia) in newborn infants are common and occur frequently in certain at‐risk groups (infants of mothers with high blood glucose levels (diabetes), infants born preterm, small and large infants). Infants with low blood glucose levels are at higher risk for developmental problems later in childhood. To manage this condition, active treatments are generally used, frequently requiring the use of formula milk or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit to receive fluid infusion into the veins, resulting in temporary separation from the mother. Sugar gel applied to the inside of the mouth is a simple and low‐cost option for the initial care of infants with low blood glucose levels. We are exploring whether oral dextrose is more effective than no treatment or other active treatments in correcting low blood glucose levels in newborn infants and reducing its long‐term effects on neurodevelopment. 
Study characteristics 
Two studies in high‐income countries have assessed the use of oral dextrose gel to reverse low blood glucose levels in a total of 312 infants. Investigators rubbed oral dextrose gel into the inside of the infant's cheek for 157 of these infants and rubbed in placebo gel or no gel for 155 infants, and then gave a normal feed.Key results
