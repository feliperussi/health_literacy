What is the effectiveness and safety of luteal support in infertile women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or by sexual intercourse? 
Background 
Luteal phase is part of the menstrual cycle. It is the time between the release of an egg (ovulation) and before the start of menstruation, and when the body produces progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) and prepares for a possible pregnancy. Ovarian stimulation (use of fertility medicines) might affect progesterone production during the luteal phase. Low levels of progesterone in the luteal phase are associated with decreased rates of pregnancy outcomes such as ongoing pregnancy (pregnancy after 12 weeks) and live birth. Luteal phase support including progesterone and/or other medical agents including pregnancy hormone (human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which stimulates progesterone production) or gonadotropin‚Äêreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which increases progesterone level after ovulation, may improve pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We included 25 randomised controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) involving a total of 5111 participants. We identified nine comparisons, including progesterone compared with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment, different dosages of vaginal progesterone supplement, different routes of progesterone supplement, GnRH agonist compared with placebo or no treatment, vaginal progesterone compared with GnRH agonist, and hCG compared with no treatment. All studies reported pregnancy outcomes, but only one study reported adverse events. All included studies reported on intrauterine insemination, a procedure where sperm is placed directly into the uterus (womb) using a thin, flexible plastic tube inserted through the vagina and cervix. No trial evaluated the effect of luteal support when trying to get pregnant naturally.
