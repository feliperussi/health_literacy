Oxytocin for reducing operative births in women with epidurals in labour
The rate of operative births (caesarean sections, forceps and vacuum extraction) continues to rise throughout the world. All three types of delivery are associated with significant complications for both the mother and her baby such as traumatic birth injuries, increased blood loss and placental complications in future pregnancies. One of the most common reasons for a woman to require an operative birth is because the labour does not progress adequately. Increasingly, epidurals are used to manage the pain during labour, however, epidurals may also slow the progression of labour. Oxytocin is a hormone that stimulates uterine contractions in labour and is given to women who are slow to progress in labour. By giving oxytocin to all women with epidurals during labour, the rate of operative deliveries, and the associated complications, could be reduced. 
Data were collected from two randomised studies (involving 319 women) which compared women with epidurals who were given either oxytocin, or a placebo. The rates of operative deliveries were not clearly different between the two groups There were also no significant differences between the other outcomes analysed, such as the Apgar scores of the newborn babies, admissions to the neonatal nursery, rates of post birth haemorrhage or rates of over stimulation of the uterus. Both studies appeared to have a low risk of bias. 
Overall, there was no significant difference between the rates of operative deliveries in women with epidurals who were given oxytocin compared with those who received the placebo. However, as there were limited data available, in order to fully determine whether augmentation of women with epidurals reduces the rate of operative deliveries and therefore reduces the complications associated, further studies are required.
