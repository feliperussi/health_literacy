Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee
Background: What is OA of the knee, and what is exercise? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of joints, such as the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. However, instead of making things better, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. Doctors used to think that OA simply resulted in thinning of the cartilage. However, it is now known that OA is a disease of the whole joint. 
Exercise can be any activity that enhances or maintains muscle strength, physical fitness and overall health. People exercise for many reasons; they may exercise to lose weight, to strengthen muscles or to relieve the symptoms of OA. 
Study characteristics 
This summary of an update of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of exercise for people with OA of the knee. After searching for all relevant studies up to May 2013, we added 23 new studies since the last version of the review, now including 54 studies (3913 participants), most on mild to moderate symptomatic knee OA. Except for five studies in which participants enrolled in a Tai Chi‐based programme, most participants underwent land‐based exercise programmes consisting of traditional muscle strengthening, functional training and aerobic fitness programmes, which were individually supervised or were provided during a class; these individuals were compared with people who did not exercise. Evidence from 44 studies (3537 participants) shows the effects of exercise immediately after treatment; 12 studies provided data on two to six‐month post‐treatment sustainability. Here we report only results for the immediate treatment period. 
Key results 
Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain).
• People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain at 12 (10 to 15) points lower at end of treatment (12% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise. 
• People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain at 32 points.
• People who did not exercise rated their pain at 44 points.
Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower score means better physical function). 
• People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function at 10 points (8 to 13 points) lower at end of treatment (10% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise.
