Injection treatment for painful Achilles tendons in adults
Background and aim of the review 
The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. Painful and stiff Achilles tendons are common overuse injuries in people undertaking sports, such as running, but also occur for other reasons in inactive people. The underlying cause is an imbalance between the damage and repair processes in the tendon. Painful Achilles tendons are often disabling and can take a long time to get better. Many treatments exist for this condition and this review set out to find out whether treatment with an injection, with a variety of agents, decreases pain and allows people to return to their previous activities. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to 20 April 2015 for studies that compared injection therapy with a placebo injection or no injection, or with an active treatment such as exercises, or different doses or types of injection therapy. We found 18 studies, which included 732 participants. Seven studies included athletes only. Study participants in the individual studies were mainly young to middle aged adults. 
Key results 
In 15 studies, patients had been assigned randomly to receive an injection therapy (such as a steroid), a placebo injection, or no injection at all. There were several different types of injection agents used and so we separated them into those agents that acted by causing damage to the tendon and those that acted to repair the tendon directly. However, there were not enough data to distinguish between these two types of injection therapies and so we only report the overall results for all injection therapies.
