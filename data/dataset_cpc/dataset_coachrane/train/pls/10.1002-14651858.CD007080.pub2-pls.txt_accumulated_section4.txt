Comparison of an upper limb nerve block using local anaesthetic with opioid analgesia for pain relief following major shoulder surgery 
Pain following surgical procedures can sometimes increase the incidence of complications in the body. It is important to manage this pain effectively. Major shoulder surgery can cause severe pain. Effectively treating this pain will help reduce complications and will promote early mobilization. A wide range of methods are used to treat pain after major shoulder surgery, including administration of opioid (derived from opium) and non‐opioid pain killers and administration of drugs that produce numbness and hence pain relief in and around the shoulder joint or around the nerves supplying the upper limb. We compared the usefulness of a continuous upper limb nerve block performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the neck close to where the nerves originate (interscalene brachial plexus block—ISBPB group) with the administration of opioid pain killers into a vein, into a muscle or under the skin (any route other than by mouth)—the parenteral opioid group. 
Evidence obtained is current to December 2012. We included two studies involving 147 participants. Seventeen participants were excluded (16 from the ISBPB group and one from the other), leaving 130 participants: 66 in the ISBPB group and 64 in the parenteral opioid group. The studies were of medium to low quality because of issues with study design, and one of the trials was sponsored by a drug company. 
The severity of pain was assessed by the patient using a numerical scale on which zero was considered as no pain and 10 or 100 as the worst imaginable pain for 72 hours in one study and 48 hours in the other. The severity of postoperative pain was significantly less for the ISBPB group at all time points in one study and at all but one time point in the other study.
