Search date 
We conducted searches up to March 2014. We updated the search in June 2015 but these results have not yet been incorporated. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 10 studies and 510 patients. All studies included a similar population of people with non‐specific low back pain. The studies only included participants with chronic low back pain. The duration of the treatment programmes in the included trials ranged from 10 days to 90 days. The duration of follow‐up varied from four weeks to six months. None of the included studies measured follow‐up beyond six months. The sample sizes ranged from 17 to 87 participants. 
Key results 
The included studies demonstrated that Pilates is probably more effective than minimal intervention in the short and intermediate term for pain and disability outcomes, and more effective than minimal intervention for improvement in function and global impression of recovery in the short term. Pilates is probably not more effective than other exercises for pain and disability in the short and intermediate term. For function, other exercises were more effective than Pilates at intermediate‐term follow‐up, but not at short‐term follow‐up. Thus, while there is some evidence for the effectiveness of Pilates for low back pain, there is no conclusive evidence that it is superior to other forms of exercise. Minor or no adverse events were reported for the interventions in this review. 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence in this review ranged from low to moderate.
