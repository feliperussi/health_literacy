Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator‐associated pneumonia
Why is this question important? 
Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is a lung infection. It develops in patients who are on artificial breathing machines (ventilators) in hospitals for more than 48 hours. Often, these patients are very ill – they may have had a heart attack or stroke, a serious accident, or major surgery. They may be unable to breathe on their own because they are unconscious or sedated while they receive treatment. 
Ventilators supply patients with oxygen through a tube placed in the mouth or nose, or through a hole in the front of the neck. If germs enter through the tube and get into the patient’s lungs, this can lead to VAP. VAP is a potentially very serious complication in patients who are already very ill. It can cause worsening health and increases patients’ risk of dying. 
Keeping a patient’s mouth clean and free of disease (oral hygiene) could help to prevent VAP. Oral hygiene care includes: 
‐ mouthwash;
‐ antiseptic (a substance that destroys harmful micro‐organisms in the mouth) gel for the gums and teeth; 
‐ a soft foam sponge (swab) or toothbrush, to clean the mouth and teeth; and
‐ tools (e.g. a suction tube) to suck away excess fluid, toothpaste or other debris from the mouth. 
These can be used alone, or in combination.
To find out if oral hygiene care does prevent VAP, and whether some types of oral hygiene care are better than others, we reviewed the evidence from research studies.
