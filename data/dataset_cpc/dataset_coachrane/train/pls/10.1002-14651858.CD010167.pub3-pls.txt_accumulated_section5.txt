Regular (ICSI) versus ultra‐high magnification (IMSI) sperm selection for assisted reproduction 
Background: Sperm micromanipulation, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is very useful for treating couples in which the male partner has reduced sperm concentration, motility, or both. In the past decade, a different approach for sperm selection has been described, which analyses sperm under ultra‐high powered magnification (6000x). Initial studies showed that intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI), using sperm selected under high magnification, was associated with higher pregnancy rates than those selected with conventional ICSI in couples with repeated implantation failures. However, the evidence from our previous Cochrane Review was uncertain of the real beneficial effects of this intervention. 
Search date: We updated our search of the medical literature in November 2019, looking for studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of IMSI (using 6000x magnification) compared to conventional ICSI (using 200x to 400x magnification) procedures. 
Study characteristics: We found 13 randomised controlled trials (four more than in the previous version), evaluating 2775 couples, that compared regular ICSI with IMSI for assisted reproduction. These studies were funded by fertility centres and universities. 
Key results: Based on the very low‐quality evidence that we found, we are uncertain of the benefit of IMSI over ICSI. The chance of having a live birth with IMSI was between 20% and 32%, compared to 25% with ICSI. For women with a 7% risk of miscarriage with regular ICSI, the risk with IMSI was between 5% and 10%. The clinical pregnancy rate with IMSI was between 35% and 44%, compared with 32% with ICSI.
