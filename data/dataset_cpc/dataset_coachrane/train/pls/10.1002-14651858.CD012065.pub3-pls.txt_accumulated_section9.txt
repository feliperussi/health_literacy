Topiramate versus carbamazepine as single drug treatment for epilepsy
This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in Issue 12, 2016 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common disorder of the nervous system in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures (physical convulsions or thought disturbances or a combination of these symptoms). We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and focal onset seizures (also known as partial onset seizures) in which the seizure is generated in and affects the same part of the brain. Focal onset seizures may become generalised (secondary generalisation) and move from one part of the brain to throughout the brain. Up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to go into long‐term remission shortly after starting drug therapy and around 70% of these individuals can achieve seizure freedom using a single antiepileptic drug. 
This review applies to people with focal onset seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) and people with tonic‐clonic seizures, a specific type of generalised onset seizure, as the recommended treatments for these seizure types are similar. 
Objective 
Topiramate and carbamazepine are commonly used treatments for individuals with epilepsy. The aim of this review was to compare how effective these drugs are at controlling recently diagnosed seizures, whether they are associated with side effects that may result in individuals stopping the drug and to inform a choice between these drugs. 
Methods 
We assessed the evidence from three clinical trials that compared topiramate with carbamazepine. We were able to combine data for 1151 people from two trials; we were not able to use the data from the remaining trial, which included 88 participants.
