Surgery for trigger finger
Background 
Trigger finger is clinically characterised by pain and catching during finger movements. Classically, the initial treatment is non‐surgical using nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, splinting and corticosteroid injection, and may require surgical treatment if the conventional treatment fails. Although it is a common condition, there is no consensus about the best surgical treatment approach (by skin incision and direct vision of the hand structures (open); approaches via needle or blade introduced through the skin, with no direct vision of the hand structures (percutaneous); or via a flexible tube with a light camera attached to it (endoscopic). 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to August 2017. We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 1260 participants, totalling 1361 trigger fingers. Two studies compared open surgery versus steroid injections, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection, one study compared open surgery versus steroid injection plus hyaluronic acid injection, one study compared percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus open surgery, one study compared endoscopic surgery versus open surgery and one study compared three types of skin incision to open surgery. The majority of participants were female (about 70%); they were aged between 16 and 88 years; and the mean follow‐up of participants after the procedure was eight weeks to 23 months. Due to space constraints, the reporting of all results was limited to the main comparison — open surgery versus steroid injection — because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first‐line treatment in clinical practice.
