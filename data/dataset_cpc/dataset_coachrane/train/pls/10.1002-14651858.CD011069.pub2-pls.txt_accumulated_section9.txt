Different methods and settings for glucose monitoring for women with gestational diabetes during pregnancy 
What is the issue? 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a glucose intolerance leading to high concentrations of glucose (sugar) in the blood (hyperglycaemia) that begins or is first recognised during pregnancy. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is an important way to maintain control of sugar concentrations in the blood. There are several different methods for monitoring blood glucose which can be carried out in different settings (e.g. at home or hospital), however it is not clear which is best for limiting health complications for women and their babies. 
Why is this important? 
Women with GDM are more likely to develop pre‐eclampsia (a dangerous condition characterised by high blood pressure) during pregnancy, and to have the birth induced, suffer trauma to the perineum during birth, or to give birth by caesarean section. Their babies are more likely to be large for their gestational age at birth, develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), and suffer from complications leading to death. Both the women and their babies are more likely to develop long‐term health complications, including type 2 diabetes. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched the medical literature in September 2016 and included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1272 women with GDM and their babies. Three trials were supported by commercial partners. 
We included five different comparisons:
1) telemedicine (transmission of glucose concentrations from home to healthcare professionals for review) versus standard care (face‐to‐face review in a clinic/hospital) (five RCTs);
