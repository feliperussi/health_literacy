Low protein diets for non‐diabetic adults with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue? 
Various forms of kidney disease can lead to kidney failure with affected people ultimately requiring dialysis treatment. A diet low in protein may be recommended to try to slow the progress of kidney disease to kidney failure. We still do not know whether low protein diets can slow the progress of kidney disease and delay the need to start dialysis. 
What did we do? 
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 7 September 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCT), which enrolled non‐diabetic adult patients with chronic kidney disease, not yet requiring dialysis, and which compared different dietary protein intakes, including very low (0.3 to 0.4 g/kg/day), low (0.5 to 0.6 g/kg/day) or normal protein intakes (≥ 0.8 g/kg/day) for 12 months or more. 
What did we find? 
We examined the evidence from 17 studies (21 data sets) with 2996 people with reduced kidney function. We found that very low protein diets compared with low or normal protein intakes probably reduce the number of people with advanced kidney failure, who progress to dialysis. When low protein diets were compared with normal protein diets, there was little of no difference in the number of people with less severe kidney failure, who progressed to dialysis. Side effects of low protein diets such as weight loss were uncommon but many studies did not report on side effects. 
Conclusions 
In people with advanced kidney failure, a very low protein intake probably slows the progress to kidney failure. However we need more information on the side effects of low protein diets and on whether quality of life is reduced because of difficulties in keeping to such a diet.
