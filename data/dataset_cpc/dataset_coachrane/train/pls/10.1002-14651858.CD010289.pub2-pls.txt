Single dose oral ibuprofen plus oxycodone for acute postoperative pain
Acute pain is often felt soon after injury, and most people who have surgery will have pain of moderate or severe intensity without treatment for their pain. In most, though not all, circumstances, the pain can be treated with oral analgesics. Many oral analgesics are available, and this review is one of a series examining how effective each one is, at particular doses. 
This review examines a combination of fixed doses of ibuprofen and oxycodone. Both are commonly used analgesics, which work by different mechanisms. We know that combining different analgesics in the same tablet gives good pain relief to more people than either analgesic alone, at the same dose. 
This review found data in three clinical trials, involving 1202 people with moderate or severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed or after abdominal or pelvic surgery. These situations are used commonly to test analgesic effectiveness, because results are applicable to other forms of acute pain after trauma. Different types of surgery give very similar estimates of the effectiveness of analgesic drugs. 
Ibuprofen 400 mg plus oxycodone 5 mg provided effective pain relief for about 6 in 10 (60%) of participants, compared with just under 2 in 10 (17%) of participants with placebo. The analgesic effects lasted longer and there were no more adverse events with the combination than with placebo. The combination provided effective pain relief to about the same proportion of people as did ibuprofen alone, but there was a lower chance of needing additional analgesia with the combination.
