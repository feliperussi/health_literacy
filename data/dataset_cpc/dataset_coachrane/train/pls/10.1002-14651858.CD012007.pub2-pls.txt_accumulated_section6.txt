Does weekly dosing of paclitaxel improve survival, compared with tri‐weekly dosing of paclitaxel in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer? 
BackgroundOvarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Treatment consists of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy (most commonly including paclitaxel and carboplatin), with the aim to reduce or delay the return of the cancer (known as progression‐free survival (PFS)), and improve chances for cancer survival (known as overall survival (OS)). Several clinical trials (studies) have investigated whether the dosing schedule (timing) of paclitaxel affects these outcomes. However, the results from reported studies are conflicting. 
The aim of the reviewWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of different schedules of paclitaxel on survival in women with newly‐diagnosed ovarian cancer. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence is current up to 15 November 2021. We included four studies with a total of 3699 participants. All studies included were randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of women aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The studies compared weekly versus tri‐weekly dosing of paclitaxel, plus carboplatin. 
Main findingsWe found that, compared with tri‐weekly paclitaxel dosing, weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely slightly improves progression‐free survival, although results in little to no difference in overall survival (high‐certainty evidence). 
For adverse effects, we found that weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely results in little to no difference in severe low neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell that helps to fight infections) (moderate‐certainty evidence); increases severe anaemia (haemoglobin level ‐ an important component of red blood cells) (high‐certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in severe damage to nerves (low‐certainty evidence).
