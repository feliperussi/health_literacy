Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for metastatic colorectal cancer
Background 
Cancer of the colon or rectum that has spread to other organs (metastatic colorectal cancer) is a commonly occurring disease that usually cannot be surgically removed. The main treatment is chemotherapy, targeted therapy (such as EGFR inhibitors, the subject of this review), or both. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a protein found on cells that plays a vital role in promoting cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies are molecules developed to attach to a particular protein in order to enhance or decrease action at that protein site. EGFR monoclonal antibodies (EGFR MAb), such as cetuximab and panitumumab, specifically target and block EGFR, which stops cancer cell growth. Research has shown that people with mutations (gene changes) in KRAS (a gene related to EGFR) may not benefit from these drugs ('KRAS mutant'), but those without mutations ('KRAS wild type') do benefit. Recent research also suggests that people with mutations in another related gene (NRAS) may not benefit from these drugs either – that is, patients need to have no mutation in either KRAS or NRAS (otherwise known as 'extended RAS wild type'). 
Another type of EGFR‐blocking drug known as tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) (e.g. erlotinib and gefitinib) is effective in the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR mutations, but its benefit in colorectal cancer is unclear. 
Objectives 
To determine the benefit and harms of EGFR MAb and EGFR TKI in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Our primary aim was to look at whether these drugs prolonged the time before disease progression (growth of the disease, usually defined as growth more than 20% or development of a new metastasis), but we also evaluated whether the drugs prolonged survival, caused the tumour to shrink, or resulted in more side effects (particularly rash and diarrhoea).
