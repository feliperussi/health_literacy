Surgery for Dupuytren's disease of the fingers
Review question 
We conducted a review of the effects of surgery for people with Dupuytren’s disease of the fingers and found 13 studies with 940 participants; 93 participants were reported twice in separate articles describing early and late outcomes of one trial. 
Background 
Dupuytren's disease is common. Patients develop scar‐like tissue under the palmar skin of the hand that draws their fingers into the palm and can affect function. 
This condition can be surgically treated by cutting out the disease, then stitching the skin back into place (fasciectomy) or replacing it with a graft of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (dermofasciectomy). Alternative approaches involve breaking the cord of disease to straighten the finger. This can be done by moving a needle back and forth through the cord until it snaps, as when rubbing a rope repeatedly over a rock (needle fasciotomy), or by injecting into it an enzyme that digests a piece of the cord (collagenase). This weakens one spot, allowing the surgeon to snap the cord and straighten the finger. As the condition is related in part to genetics, it tends to come back, even after successful treatment. As the latter two treatments leave the broken ends of the cord behind, recurrence may be quicker after these procedures than after traditional excisional surgery. However, recovery might also be quicker. The most effective treatment is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
After searching for all relevant studies up to May 2015, we found 13 studies (14 articles) that met our inclusion criteria. However, only three compared different operation types. The others compared aspects of one operation type. One study presented early and late outcomes. 
Key results 
What happens to people with Dupuytren’s disease up to five weeks after needle fasciotomy compared with fasciectomy? 
• Hand function may be slightly better after needle fasciotomy than after fasciectomy (low‐quality evidence). 
• People who have had needle fasciotomy may be more satisfied than those who have had fasciectomy (low‐quality evidence). 
• Fasciectomy probably straightens fingers better than needle fasciotomy in people with advanced disease, but probably no difference is apparent in people with milder disease (low‐quality evidence). 
• A feeling of tingling in the fingers is probably more common after fasciectomy than after needle fasciotomy during the first week after treatment (low‐quality evidence). 
What happens to people with Dupuytren’s disease five years after needle fasciotomy compared with fasciectomy? 
• Satisfaction may be better after fasciectomy than after needle fasciotomy (low‐quality evidence). 
• Recurrence may be more common after needle fasciotomy than after fasciectomy (low‐quality evidence). 
What happens to people with Dupuytren’s disease up to 36 months after z‐plasty closure of a limited fasciectomy compared with use of small ‘firebreak’ skin grafts (a form of dermofasciectomy)? 
• Little or no difference in outcomes is likely between patients who had z‐plasty and those who had small skin grafts, although skin graft procedures take longer to perform (low‐quality evidence). 
What happens to people with Dupuytren’s disease who wear a splint at night after surgery? 
• Wearing a splint at night after surgery probably does not help to straighten fingers nor to improve hand function, and it may slightly worsen the patient's ability to make a full fist (low‐quality evidence).
