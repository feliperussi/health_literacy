Radiotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, after surgery for early‚Äêstage cervical cancer 
At present, doctors are not sure whether women with early cervical cancer who have had their womb and pelvic lymph nodes removed should be given radiotherapy. If the woman has a combination of certain risk factors that put her at high risk of having a recurrence of her cancer, doctors often think that it would be a good idea to give her radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy has never been shown to improve overall survival for these women and the combination of surgery and radiotherapy increases the risk of side effects and complications. We searched for all the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed whether radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) could improve survival in these women. 
We found only two trials that compared the use of radiotherapy with no radiotherapy in women with early cervical cancer who had had their womb and pelvic lymph nodes removed and who were at risk of having a recurrence of their cancer. These two trials enrolled 397 women. When we combined the findings from these two trials, we found that, on average, women who received radiotherapy were between 40% and 90% less likely to have a relapse of their cancer within 5 years than women who did not. However, because of the low number of deaths in the trials, we could not confirm whether radiotherapy helped to prolong life: our best estimate was that, 5 years after treatment, women who received radiotherapy were about 20% more likely to be alive than those who did not, but this estimate may not be very accurate and women's actual prospects could be anywhere between being three times more likely to be alive and being 60% more likely to be dead. 
Although women who had radiotherapy tended to have more complications than women who did not, we could not be sure whether this was due to chance rather than the radiotherapy because few women reported complications.
