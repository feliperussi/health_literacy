Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence.
