Comparing different types of antibiotics given routinely to women at caesarean section to reduce infections 
What is the issue? 
We wanted to find out if giving specific types of antibiotics routinely at caesarean sections reduced the number of women and babies with infections, when compared with other types of antibiotics. We also looked to see if there were differences in adverse effects. The main types of antibiotics we considered were ones which target infections most commonly seen after giving birth, so we looked mainly at cephalosporins versus penicillins. We collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question (date of latest search 2 December 2019). 
Why is this important? 
Women undergoing caesarean section have an increased likelihood of infection compared with women giving birth vaginally. These infections can come from the urine, the surgical incision, or occur in the lining of the womb (endometritis). Infections can be serious, causing, for example, an abscess in the pelvis or infection in the blood. Very occasionally they can lead to a mother's death, particularly in low‚Äêresource settings. Good surgical techniques are important to reduce infection, along with the use of skin antiseptics and giving antibiotics before the initiation of the caesarean section. Antibiotics can, however, cause adverse effects in the mother, such as nausea, vomiting, skin rash and in some rare cases allergic reactions. The mother and the baby can develop thrush (candida). Antibiotics given to women around the time of giving birth can also change the baby's gut flora and may interfere with the baby's developing immune system.
