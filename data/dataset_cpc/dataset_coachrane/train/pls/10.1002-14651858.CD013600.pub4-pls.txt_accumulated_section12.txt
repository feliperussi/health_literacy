Is plasma from people who have recovered from COVID‐19 an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• We are very confident that convalescent plasma has no benefits for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‐19. 
• We are uncertain about the effects of convalescent plasma for treating people with mild COVID‐19 or who have no symptoms.  
• We found about 130 ongoing, unpublished and recently published studies. We will update our review with evidence from these studies as soon as possible. New evidence may answer our remaining questions. 
What is convalescent plasma? 
The body produces antibodies as one of its defences against infection. Antibodies are found in part of the blood called plasma. Plasma from people who have recovered from the COVID‐19 virus contains COVID‐19 antibodies, and can be used to make two preparations. Firstly, it can be used to make convalescent plasma, which is plasma that contains these antibodies. Secondly, it can be used to make hyperimmune immunoglobulin, which is more concentrated, and therefore contains more antibodies. 
Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin have been used successfully to treat some viruses. These treatments (given by a drip or injection) are generally well‐tolerated, but can cause unwanted effects. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin are effective treatments for people with confirmed COVID‐19. We looked at: 
• deaths from any cause after treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin;
• improvement or worsening of patients’ condition, measured by the number of people who needed help from a ventilator (a machine that helps people breathe if they cannot breathe on their own);
