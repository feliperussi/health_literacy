In this review we have included results from 27 randomised trials with more than 12,000 women. All of the trials examined telephone support versus usual care (no additional telephone support). In two trials women received automated text messages. We did not identify any trials comparing different types of telephone support (for example, text messaging versus one‐to‐one calls). All but one of the trials were carried out in high‐resource settings. The majority of studies examined support provided via telephone conversations between women and health professionals although a small number of trials included telephone support from peers. Many of the results described in the review are based on findings from only one or two studies. Overall, results were inconsistent and inconclusive. Telephone support may increase women's overall satisfaction with their care during pregnancy and the postnatal period; although results for both periods were from only two studies. There was no consistent evidence confirming that telephone support reduces anxiety during pregnancy or after the birth of the baby. Evidence from two trials showed that women who received support had lower average depression scores in the postnatal period but without clear evidence that women who were supported were less likely to have a diagnosis of depression. Results from trials encouraging breastfeeding through telephone support were also inconsistent, although there was some evidence that telephone support may increase the duration of breastfeeding. There was no strong evidence that women receiving telephone support were less likely to be smoking at the end of pregnancy or during the postnatal period.
