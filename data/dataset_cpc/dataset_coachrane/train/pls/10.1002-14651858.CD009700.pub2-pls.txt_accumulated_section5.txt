Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for treating keratoconus
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effect of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) (new technique) versus penetrating keratoplasty (standard technique) in people with keratoconus. 
Background  Keratoconus is a disease of the cornea, which is the clear surface at the very front of the eye. In eyes with keratoconus, the cornea becomes weak and cannot keep the spherical shape needed to provide "normal" vision. While the majority of people diagnosed with keratoconus can be treated with rigid contact lenses, in approximately 10% to 15% of patients this treatment is not sufficient and they require a corneal graft. This may be full‐thickness (penetrating) or partial‐thickness (lamellar). While the nature of each of these two types of transplantation suggest pros and cons for both, the clinical and practical outcomes have not previously been systematically reviewed. 
Study characteristics  We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved a total of 111 participants in this review. Both trials were conducted in single medical centres in Iran and compared the outcomes, at least three months post‐suture removal (for a minimum of 12 months in the newer study, and for a range of 6.8 to 36.4 months in the older study), of participants with keratoconus who had received DALK to those who had received penetrating keratoplasty. The evidence is current to October 2013. 
Key results  The results suggested that graft rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty, however likelihood of graft failure was similar in both groups, as were visual and structural results.
