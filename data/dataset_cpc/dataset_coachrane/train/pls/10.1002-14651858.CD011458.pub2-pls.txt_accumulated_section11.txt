Asenapine versus placebo for schizophrenia
Review question 
Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the early‐to‐mid 1990s. The review looks at the effects of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo. 
Background 
People with schizophrenia often have 'positive symptoms', such as hearing voices, seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). People also have 'negative symptoms', including loss of emotions, apathy, social withdrawal, lack of pleasure and difficulty speaking and communicating. Disorder of thoughts, anxiety and depression are common. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs, which are divided into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). These drugs often have severe side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, involuntary shaking and tiredness. Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the 1990s. At present there are no systematic reviews assessing the effects of this drug. 
Study characteristics 
The review includes six trials with 1835 people. The trials randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either asenapine or placebo. Five of these trials had high rates of people leaving early and were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
There is some evidence that asenapine, when compared to placebo, improves the positive, negative and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia while having less risk of debilitating side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
However, due to the low quantity and limited quality of evidence currently available, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for schizophrenia. There is a need for large‐scale, longer‐term follow up, and bias‐free randomised controlled trials investigating the effects and safety of asenapine.
