Fifteen studies of moderate to high quality were reviewed and provide the best evidence we have today. The studies tested almost 6000 people with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The studies compared people who took 4000 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) a day to people who took a placebo (fake pill) or non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.   What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling. It is not clear which type is best to use or which causes more side effects: high doses of acetaminophen may cause stomach problems, such as ulcers, and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems.   What did the studies show?  Acetaminophen compared to placebo  The studies show that people who took acetaminophen has less pain (when resting, moving, sleeping and overall) and felt better overall than people who took a placebo. Pain (when measured on a different scale), physical function and stiffness were about the same.  • Pain decreased by 4 more points on a scale of 0‐100 for people who took acetaminophen instead of a placebo.
