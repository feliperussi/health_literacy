Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for stroke recovery
Review questionWhat are the effects of selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs on recovery from stroke? 
BackgroundStroke is a major cause of disability. Stroke‐related disability can include difficulty with daily tasks such as toileting, washing, and walking. Sometimes disability is so severe that a person becomes dependent on others for performing basic activities (this is known as 'dependence'). We previously published an update of this Cochrane Review which aimed to find out whether SSRIs (a class of drug usually used to treat mood problems, which work by changing the level of chemicals in the brain) might improve recovery after stroke. 
Since the update in 2019, two large studies have now been completed and so it is necessary to perform a further update of this review. In our main analyses we included only high‐quality trials, that is those which used rigorous methods to avoid biases (such as the person assessing outcome being aware of whether the stroke survivor received the active drug or placebo). We refer to these studies as 'low risk of bias' studies. 
We also wanted to find out whether SSRIs had other benefits, for example improving the severity of any arm or leg weakness, mood, anxiety, cognition, quality of life, and whether SSRIs were associated with side effects such as bleeding or seizures. 
Study characteristicsIn total we found 76 studies recruiting 13,029 stroke survivors within one year of their stroke. There was a wide age range. About half the studies required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between studies. However, only six of these studies were at low risk of bias; the participants in these studies did not have to be depressed to enter the study, and they were all recruited soon after their stroke.
