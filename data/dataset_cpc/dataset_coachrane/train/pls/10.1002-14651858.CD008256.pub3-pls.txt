Booster dose for preventing hepatitis B infection
Background  Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) wane over time following hepatitis B immunisation; hence, it is unclear whether people vaccinated in 3‐dose or 4‐dose schedules of the hepatitis B vaccine during their primary vaccination are still immune when the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti‐HBs) level in their body is undetectable, or lower than the level usually considered protective. This question may potentially be answered indirectly by measuring the anamnestic immune response to a booster dose of vaccine given to people previously immunised with the hepatitis B vaccine. 
Aim  The authors selected to assess the benefits and harms of a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, more than five years after the primary vaccination. 
Searches  Electronic searches were performed up until January 2016. 
Selection criteria  Randomised clinical trials addressing immune response (i.e., the way your body recognises and defends itself against bacteria, viruses, and substances that appear foreign and harmful to the body) to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, more than five years after the primary vaccination in apparently healthy participants, vaccinated in a three‐dose or four‐dose schedule of hepatitis B vaccine during their primary vaccination, without receiving an additional dose of the hepatitis B vaccine or immunoglobulin. 
Main results and conclusions  We were unable to find any eligible randomised clinical trials to include in this review. There is no scientific evidence, based on randomised clinical trials, to support or reject the need for booster doses of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals with normal immune status. We need evidence, based on randomised clinical trials, to formulate future booster vaccination policies.
