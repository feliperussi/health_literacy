What are the benefits and risks of eye drops that widen the pupil as an additional treatment for inflammation after a blow to the eye? 
Why this question is importantHospital emergency departments often treat people with eye injuries. There are two main types of eye injuries: 
• blunt trauma injuries, when an object or force strikes the eye. Common causes of blunt trauma to the eye include motor vehicle accidents, sports‐ or work‐related accidents, or fights; 
• penetrating trauma injuries, when a sharp object or an object traveling at high speed (for example, from pellets fired by air‐powered guns) pierces the eye. 
Blunt trauma is the more common form of eye injury. People who have these injuries often develop traumatic iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye that surrounds the black pupil) and the ciliary body (the muscles and tissue around the iris). Traumatic iridocyclitis can develop after both major and minor blunt trauma, and can affect children as well as adults. Symptoms associated with damage to the iris and ciliary body include eye pain and sensitivity to light. If the inflammation goes unnoticed or is not treated properly, it can cause vision loss. 
The standard treatment for traumatic iridocyclitis is anti‐inflammatory eye drops (corticosteroids). Eye drops that widen the pupil (mydriatics) are usually used as an additional treatment, to reduce eye pain and discomfort, and to shorten the duration of symptoms. 
We aimed to find out whether the use of mydriatics plus corticosteroids to treat traumatic iridocyclitis is beneficial or causes more unwanted effects than corticosteroids alone by reviewing the research evidence. Specifically, we wanted to know if mydriatics relieve eye pain and inflammation and improve vision. We also wanted to find out if mydriatics cause complications such as chronic pain, and if they have any serious negative effects on sight (including blindness).
