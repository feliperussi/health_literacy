Giving melatonin to women in pregnancy to protect the baby's brain and improve long‐term outcomes for the baby 
What is the issue? 
As a baby's brain develops during pregnancy, it is susceptible to damage. A number of factors can increase the risk of injury to the developing brain of both preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and term (after 37 weeks of pregnancy) babies. This injury can lead to death of the baby, or if the baby survives, to life‐long health problems, such as hearing, sight and speech disorders; seizures; intellectual disabilities; and motor impairments, including cerebral palsy, which is the most common physical disability in childhood. Being born preterm, small‐for‐gestational age, or low birthweight; abnormalities of the mother's placenta (the organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall); uterine infection; and birth asphyxia, caused by a lack of oxygen to the baby that lasts long enough to cause harm, can increase the risk of brain injury and cerebral palsy with associated impairments or disabilities. 
Melatonin is a small hormone that is usually made by the pineal gland (a small gland in the brain) during the night. It helps to regulate the sleep‐wake cycle, is an antioxidant (that protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals), and interacts with the immune system (the structures and processes in the body that protect against disease). 
Why is this important? 
It is possible that melatonin, given to a mother in pregnancy, can help protect her baby's brain. Animal studies, including in mice, rats and sheep, have suggested that melatonin may be able to protect the developing human baby's brain from injury when given to the mother during pregnancy.
