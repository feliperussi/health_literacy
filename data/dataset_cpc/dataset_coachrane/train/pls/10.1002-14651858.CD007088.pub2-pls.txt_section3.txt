We identified two trials with 156 participants for this review. The comparisons included in these two trials were 1) percutaneous cholecystostomy plus laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key hole removal of gallbladder) immediately after the general condition improves (percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy) versus planned delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed routinely (1 trial; 70 participants) and 2) percutaneous cholecystostomy versus conservative treatment (supportive treatment and antibiotic treatment) (1 trial; 86 participants). Both trials were at high risk of systematic error (prone to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trials were designed and data were analysed). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who died or developed complications between any of the comparison groups. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy in the only comparison that reported this outcome (percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). The mean total hospital stay and mean costs were significantly lower in the percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group compared with the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Because of the few trials included in this review and due to their low sample size, there is risk of random errors (play of chance). Based on the current available evidence, we are unable to determine the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy in the clinical management of high‐risk surgical patients with acute cholecystitis. There is a need for well‐designed clinical trials with low risk of systematic error and random errors on this issue.
