Does communicating DNA‐based risk estimates motivate people to change their behaviour?
Tests can now be conducted in which DNA is analysed to estimate the chance of developing diseases such as heart disease or lung cancer in smokers.  It was thought that risk estimates derived from these genetic tests may motivate people to change their behaviour in order to reduce the identified risks. In the current review, we assessed the effect of communicating disease risk estimates from genetic tests on risk‐reducing behaviours and motivation to undertake such behaviours. 
A systematic search located 14 papers reporting the results of 13 eligible studies: seven clinical studies and six analogue studies (studies in which participants are given hypothetical scenarios asking them to imagine receiving genetic test based disease risk estimates). 
Five clinical studies assessed smoking cessation, with statistical combination of the results revealing no statistically significant effects on smoking cessation in either the short‐term (< six months) or long term (> six months). Two clinical studies assessed dietary behaviour and showed that communicating genetic test‐based risk estimates did change people's behaviour.The two studies assessing physical activity and the one study assessing medication or vitamin use aimed at reducing disease risks did not show that communicating DNA‐based disease risk estimates had an effect on behaviour. 
For the six analogue studies, statistical combination of the results revealed a statistically significant effect of genetic test based disease risk estimates on intention to change behaviour only. There was no evidence of any unintended detrimental effects on motivation or mood.
