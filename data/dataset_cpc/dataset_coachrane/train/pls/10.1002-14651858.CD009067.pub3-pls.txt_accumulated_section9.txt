Patterns of breastfeeding, according to the baby or according to the clock
What is the issue? 
Patterns of breastfeeding can vary greatly. Two very different approaches are often used to determine when the baby will breastfeed and for how long. One approach is led by the baby, and is known as baby‐led, unrestricted or breastfeeding on demand. The other approach is led by the clock, and is known as scheduled, timed or restricted breastfeeding. 
From the early 20th century women in many health settings were advised to breastfeed according to the clock; timing and restricting both the frequency and length of breastfeeds. This advice was based on bottle‐feeding patterns. This practice changed when baby‐led or demand breastfeeding was advocated. With baby‐led breastfeeding, the amount of milk produced is determined by the baby's demand. The baby then controls the supply of milk, ensuring that enough milk is produced to meet his or her needs. With this approach, close contact between the mother and her baby is encouraged with no restrictions placed on their time together. However, the mother may not always be in a position to breastfeed her baby on demand due to, for example, being separated from her baby for any reason, and there can be uncertainty for the mother if and when her baby does not demand a breastfeed. 
Why is this important? 
Mothers require information on the frequency and duration of breastfeeds but they receive conflicting advice. Current guidelines encourage baby‐led breastfeeding. It is important to systematically review the evidence, to inform women's decisions on the relative effectiveness of each method. 
This review is also important as baby‐led breastfeeding is not always followed, as many women and caregivers seem more comfortable with scheduled rather than baby‐led feeding patterns. 
What evidence did we find?
