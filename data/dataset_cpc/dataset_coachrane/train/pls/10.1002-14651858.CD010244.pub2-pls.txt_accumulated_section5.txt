Surgical removal of part of the pancreas and other tissues versus other treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer which invades the surrounding structures 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food. It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients receive palliative treatment. Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear. We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments. We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions. We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors. 
Characteristics of studies 
We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials. Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment. The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin.
