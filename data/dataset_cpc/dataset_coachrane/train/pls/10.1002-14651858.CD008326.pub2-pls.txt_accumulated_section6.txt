Total disc replacement for chronic low‐back pain
Artificial joints have had a remarkable impact in reducing pain and improving function in the knee and hip. But what about joint replacement in the spine? This systematic review set out to determine how total disc replacement compares with other treatments for chronic low‐back pain in randomised controlled trials. 
The disc is a strong but flexible structure that cushions and separates the bony vertebrae of the spine. Disc degeneration is a nearly universal feature of the aging process. Though there are many theories about the causes of low‐back pain, chronic symptoms are often attributed to disc degeneration. So when patients do not improve after nonsurgical care, they sometimes consider surgery to remove a degenerated disc. 
The traditional surgical approach in this area is spinal fusion, which involves removing all or part of a degenerated disc and joining the vertebrae above and below it. Previous reviews suggest that fusion surgery can lead to moderate pain relief and modest gains in function.  It appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy—but no better than an intensive rehabilitation program. 
An alternative surgical approach is total disc replacement, which involves removing the disc and replacing it with an artificial implant made out of metal and plastic. 
We identified seven randomised trials—involving a total of 1474 patients. Only one study compared total disc replacement with nonsurgical treatment, suggesting that surgery resulted in slightly better outcomes than intensive rehabilitation. But this did not translate into a clinically significant advantage that would make a major difference in patients’ lives.
