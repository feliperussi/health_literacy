Sedation medication for relieving symptoms at the end of life
Background 
People with diseases that are not curable may have a variety of symptoms at the end of life. These symptoms can include confusion (delirium), anxiety, restlessness, breathlessness (dyspnoea), pain, vomiting, and distress. Medicines that reduce consciousness (sedatives) may help relieve these symptoms when people are close to death. 
Treatment with sedatives can vary in terms of the level of sedation (mild, intermediate, and deep), and duration (intermittent or continuous). 
Study chara cteristics 
We searched international databases in October 2012 and again in December 2014 for studies of terminally ill adults who required sedation in order to control symptoms. We found 14 studies of around 4000 people. The studies compared sedation versus non‚Äêsedation. Most people in the studies had cancer (95%). The studies took place in hospices, palliative care units, hospitals, and the home. 
Key results 
Five studies showed that sedatives did not fully relieve delirium or breathlessness. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the other symptoms. There was no difference in time from admission or referral to death 
Only one study reported side effects, and did not report any major problems.
Future studies should focus on how sedatives affect a person's quality of life, or peacefulness and comfort during the dying phase, and how well sedation controls the distressing symptoms. Side effects should be better reported. 
Quality of evidence 
The studies were not randomised controlled trials (where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups), and so we judged the quality of the evidence as poor.
