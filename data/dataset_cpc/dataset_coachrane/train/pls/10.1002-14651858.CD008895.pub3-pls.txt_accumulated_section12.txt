Education for people with coronary heart disease
Review question 
What are the effects of patient education delivered as part of cardiac rehabilitation, compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and healthcare costs in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD)? 
Background 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, more people now live with heart disease and may need support to manage symptoms and reduce risk of future problems such as heart attacks. Education is a common element of cardiac rehabilitation, which aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with heart disease. This is an update of a review last published in 2011.

Study characteristics 
We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of education‐based treatments compared with no education in people of all ages with CHD. 
We included nine new trials which involved 8215 people with coronary heart disease that compared patient education with no education. We included a total of 22 trials that studied 76,864 people with heart disease, most of whom had survived heart attack, and had undergone heart bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure which opens blocked vessels that supply blood to heart muscle). 
Study funding sources 
Sixteen studies reported sources of funding; six did not report funding sources. One study was funded by an industrial sponsor, four by health insurance companies and 11 by government or public sources.
