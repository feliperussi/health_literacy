None of the 10 included trials reported data on all‐cause mortality (death from any cause), serious side effects (untoward medical occurrences that result in serious outcomes such as death or disability), health‐related quality of life (a measure of physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), hepatitis B‐related death, and hepatitis B‐related morbidity. We are uncertain whether Xiao Chai Hu Tang formula versus no intervention has a positive or negative effect regarding side effects considered 'not to be serious', the proportion of people with detectable HBeAg (a hepatitis B viral protein that indicates active viral replication), and separately reported side effects considered 'not to be serious'. Xiao Chai Hu Tang formula compared with no intervention seems to reduce the proportion of people with detectable HBV‐DNA (which is used to indicate how much hepatitis B virus is in the blood) but the reliability of this finding is low. Surrogate outcomes are markers that are used in research as a substitute for a clinically meaningful measure that directly measures patient outcomes. We cannot always be certain that such surrogate outcomes are reliable substitutes for important outcomes as they need to be officially examined. Caution is needed with this beneficial finding as the trials are at high risk of bias, and this outcome has not yet been proven relevant to patients. We identified an additional 47 studies as potential randomised clinical trials, but the data they reported were of no use. Accordingly, properly designed randomised clinical trials are needed before the benefits and harms of Xiao Chai Hu Tang formula for chronic hepatitis B can be determined.
