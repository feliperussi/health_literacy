Occupational therapy after hip replacement
Background 
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common surgical procedure for the treatment of pain and disability cause by osteoarthritis. Following THA, people have usually been provided with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and chairs, and educated to avoid activities that could cause the hip joint to be in a position of bending, twisting or where people cross their legs. These interventions aim to reduce the chances of dislocating the new hip, which is a painful and disabling event. This advice and equipment provision is often led by occupational therapists after a THA. We wanted to find out whether these types of treatments improve a person's recovery following a THA. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane review is current to 29 April 2016. We searched the available evidence and included three studies, which had 492 people who had received a THA. Two of these studies investigated providing people with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and rails, and restricting their body movements (one of these studies also provided people with physiotherapy). One study investigated teaching participants about doing certain activities of daily living in a safe way to promote self‚Äêcare without the risk of dislocating the new hip. The interventions were different and thus we did not combine the results. 
Key results 
One study compared outcomes for participants randomised to the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions versus no provision of hip precautions or equipment or functional restrictions. This is the main comparator in the review.
