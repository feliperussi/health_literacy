Payment methods for healthcare providers in outpatient healthcare settings
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effect of different payment methods for healthcare providers working in outpatient healthcare settings. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 27 studies. 
Key messages 
This review suggests that different payment methods can affect healthcare provider behaviour in both positive and negative ways. For instance, whilst healthcare providers may be encouraged to provide more of specific services, they may also be encouraged to provide unnecessary services. Considerable gaps remain in the understanding of how payment of healthcare providers affects healthcare services, healthcare providers’ work morale and workload, and patient health. 
What was studied in the review? 
Healthcare providers may be paid in different ways. Different payment methods can encourage healthcare providers to give patients the treatment they need in the best and most cost‐efficient way, but they can also encourage healthcare providers to offer poor‐quality, expensive, and unnecessary care, and to avoid certain treatments or certain types of patients. Different payment methods can also influence healthcare providers’ work morale and workload. And they can cost more or less for the healthcare system. 
The review authors searched for studies on the effects of different payment methods for healthcare providers working in outpatient care. Outpatient care is where patients get health care from healthcare providers outside of hospitals and where there is no need for a bed. Healthcare centres, family planning centres, and dental clinics are all examples of outpatient facilities.
