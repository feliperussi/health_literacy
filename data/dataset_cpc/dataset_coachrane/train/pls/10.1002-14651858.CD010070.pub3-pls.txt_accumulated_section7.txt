Altered dietary salt intake for adults with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue? 
People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a reduced kidney function that persists over time. People with CKD are at increased risk of heart disease and worsening kidney function which can lead to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive. High salt intake is linked to risk factors for both heart disease and worsening kidney function, including high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine and fluid overload. Therefore reducing salt intake may help reduce risk of heart disease and preserve kidney function. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of reducing salt intake for people with CKD. 
What did we do? 
We searched the evidence up to October 2020 to find randomised controlled trials comparing two or more levels of salt intake in adults with CKD, including those in the earlier stages of CKD, those treated with dialysis, and those who had received a kidney transplant. 
What did we find? 
We found 21 studies that included 1197 adults with CKD (725 in low salt and 725 people in high salt group). Study participants included adults who were in the early stages of CKD (779 people in 12 studies), adults who were on dialysis (363 people in seven studies), and adult kidney transplant recipients (55 people in two studies). The average study duration was seven weeks, ranging from one to 36 weeks. We did not find any studies that measured the effect on the incidence of death, heart disease, or need for dialysis or kidney transplantation. Instead, we found studies that measured risk factors for these outcomes.
