Is recent‐onset psychosis best treated by a specialist mental health team?
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.Mental health professionals assess a person before recommending a specific treatment. Depending on the services available, they may send people for treatment to: 
‐ a community mental health team: mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions; 
‐ a crisis resolution team: mental health professionals who treat people who would otherwise need treatment in hospital; or 
‐ an early intervention team: mental health professionals who work with people who are currently or have recently experienced their first episode of psychosis. 
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat it as quickly and intensively as possible. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether specialist early intervention teams were more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than outpatient or community mental health teams that do not specialise in treating it. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of early intervention teams to treat recent‐onset psychosis compared with standard community mental health care.
