Treatment for chronic Staphylococcus aureus chest infection in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We looked for evidence to see whether long‐term antibiotic treatment for chronic infection with methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in people with cystic fibrosis would lead to improved clinical outcomes and better results for measures of infection 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition that causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs leading to persistent infection with bacteria. Methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MSSA), is the name given to a particular bacteria which is a common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. It can cause long‐term infection in people with cystic fibrosis which leads to worsening lung function and poor overall clinical outcome. There are currently no guidelines based on trial results to inform clinicians how best to treat this infection in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 February 2018.
Study characteristics 
We found 58 trials in our searches, but could not find any which compared different treatments for this condition in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, none of these trials were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review. 
Key results 
Although methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus is an important and common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis, there is no agreement on how best to treat long‐term infection. The review highlights the need to organise well‐designed trials to decide the best management strategy for chronic methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection in people with cystic fibrosis.
