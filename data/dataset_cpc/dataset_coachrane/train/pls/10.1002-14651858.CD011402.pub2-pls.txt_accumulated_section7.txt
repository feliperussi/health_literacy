Use of drains in adults after surgery for chronic subdural haematoma
What is a chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH)? 
A chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is the slow accumulation of blood between the brain and the membrane that surrounds it. CSDH is a common type of brain (intracranial) haematoma and occurs more frequently in older people. Up to 75% of CSDHs are caused by trauma to the head, though this trauma can be trivial, with no loss of consciousness, vomiting or seizures, or any other post‐trauma symptoms. Symptoms of CSDH depend upon the size of the haematoma and the parts of the brain on which it exerts pressure, but may include confusion or coma; memory problems; difficulty speaking, swallowing or walking; drowsiness; headaches; seizures; and weakness or numbness of limbs and face. 
How is CSDH treated? 
CSDH is treated most effectively through surgery with ‘burr‐hole evacuation’. In this procedure one or two holes (5 mm to 30 mm wide) are drilled through the skull over the haematoma. The accumulated blood is washed out through these holes. Sometimes, at the end of surgery, surgeons insert a soft silicone drain through one burr hole to continue to drain the space previously occupied by the blood (subdural drainage). These drains remove any fluid that accumulates into an external collection vessel, and stay in place for 24 to 48 hours after surgery before being removed. Alternatively, at the end of surgery, the wounds are closed surgically without insertion of external drains. 
Why might drains be important? 
Recurrence (i.e. formation of another CSDH in the same place) is a major problem with CSDH, and patients may need additional, repeated surgical procedures to remove them. Drains might reduce recurrence, but are not used routinely. The authors of this Cochrane Review wanted to discover whether the use of external drains after burr‐hole surgery for CSDH reduces the risk of recurrence of CSDH.
