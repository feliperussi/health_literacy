Low molecular weight heparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with lower‐limb immobilization in an outpatient setting 
Background 
Venous thromboembolism is a condition where a blood clot forms in the deep veins (DVT), most commonly of the leg. The concern is that it can travel up to block the arteries in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). In adult patients, immobilization of the lower limb with a plaster cast or brace is a risk factor for DVT and pulmonary embolism. To prevent this complication, preventive treatment with anticoagulants (medication that thins the blood) is often used, most commonly, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). However, there is no agreement on this in existing national guidelines. Therefore, we searched the literature for trials on this topic, in order to assess the evidence. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included eight studies in this review (current until April 2017). The studies included a total of 3680 participants. Participants received either LMWH subcutaneously once daily, or no preventive treatment or placebo. New cases of DVT ranged from 4.3% to 40% in the control groups and ranged from 0% to 37% in the LMWH groups. The risk of DVT was lower in participants who received LMWH. Further analysis also showed a reduction in the occurrence of DVT when the use of LMWH was compared to no treatment or placebo in the following groups of participants: patients with below‐knee casts, conservatively treated patients (patients not operated), operated patients, patients with fractures, patients with soft‐tissue injuries, patients with above‐knee thrombosis, and patients with below‐knee thrombosis. No clear differences were found between the LMWH and control groups for pulmonary embolism. The studies showed less symptomatic venous thromboembolism in the LMWH groups compared with the control groups. No cases of death due to pulmonary embolism were reported. One study reported one death in the control group.
