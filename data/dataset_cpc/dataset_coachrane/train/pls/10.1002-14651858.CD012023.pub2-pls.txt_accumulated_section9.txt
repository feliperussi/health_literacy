Hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects that hearing aids have on everyday life in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. We were interested in (1) a person's ability to take part in everyday situations, (2) general health‐related quality of life, (3) ability to listen to other people, and (4) harm, such as pain or over‐exposure to noise. 
Background 
Hearing loss is very common and adults with hearing loss may be offered hearing aids. These devices increase the loudness, and may improve the clarity, of sounds so that they are easier to hear. The main goal of hearing aids is to reduce the impact of hearing loss and to improve a person's ability to take part in everyday life. Although hearing aids are the most common technology for adults with hearing loss and are in widespread use, it is not clear how beneficial they are. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is up to date to 23 March 2017. We found five clinical studies involving 825 adults with mild to moderate hearing loss who were randomly given either hearing aids, no hearing aids or placebo hearing aids. Studies involved older adults with the average age within studies between 69 and 83 years. The duration of the studies was between six weeks and six months. 
Key results 
We found evidence in three studies that hearing aids have a large beneficial effect in improving the ability of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to take part in everyday situations. Hearing aids have a small beneficial effect in improving general health‐related quality of life, such as physical, social, emotional and mental well‐being, and have a large effect in improving the ability to listen to other people.
