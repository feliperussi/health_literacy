What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for elbow fractures in children?
Key messages 
‐ A child with a supracondylar elbow fracture (a broken bone in the upper elbow, approximately 5 cm above the elbow joint) may have a lower risk of nerve injury if two or more wires are inserted from the outside of the elbow rather than having one wire inserted from the inside of the elbow and one from the outside (crossed wires). The method used by the doctor to manually move the bones back into position may not increase or reduce the risk of nerve injury, but using a closed method may reduce the risk of an infection. 
‐ Because we did not find enough studies about other treatments for these elbow fractures, their benefits and risks are unclear.  
‐ More, well‐designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and harms of other treatments. These studies should focus on outcomes related to elbow movement, as well as quality of life and how upset the child is. 
What are supracondylar elbow fractures? 
This type of broken bone is in the upper arm bone, approximately 5 cm above the elbow joint. It is the most common broken bone in the elbow during childhood, and can affect a child's day‐to‐day function as well as their ability to play and do sport. 
How are these broken bones treated? 
Treatment varies according to whether the bone has moved out of position. If it has moved, the doctor may manually move it back into a normal position. Doctors do this using a 'closed reduction' (without opening up the skin) or 'open reduction' (after the skin has been opened up).
