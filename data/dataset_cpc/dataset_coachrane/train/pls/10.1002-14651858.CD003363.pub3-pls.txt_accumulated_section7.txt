The effectiveness of community interventions to promote condom use in the prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections 
Bakground 
Since the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, condom promotion has become one of the most widely used interventions to prevent transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, despite widespread promotion of condom use globally, new cases of HIV and other STIs either remain high or continue to rise in some particular regions and settings across the world. It is believed that by modifying the environment in which people live, it is possible to improve access and use of condoms on a large scale so that the transmission of HIV and other STIs decreases. This review aimed to assess if this theory was correct. 
Methods 
We screened all relevant literature from January 1980 to April 2014. Two independent authors selected and assessed the trials. 
Results 
We obtained nine studies, involving 75,891 participants and with a duration raging from one to nine years. Seven of these studies were conducted in Sub‐Saharan Africa, one in Peru, and one in a multi‐country location. Condom promotion was implemented in all the studies. Our results did not provide clear evidence that condom promotion in these specific contexts led to a decrease in the transmission of HIV and other STIs. However, knowledge about HIV and other STIs increased, as did reported condom use. A likely reason for the negative results in this review is that sexual behaviors are difficult to change. For example, we found no difference in the number of sexual partners after the intervention was implemented. Also, if there is not consistent condom use the risk of transmission remains for HIV and other STIs. The quality of the evidence was deemed to be moderate.
