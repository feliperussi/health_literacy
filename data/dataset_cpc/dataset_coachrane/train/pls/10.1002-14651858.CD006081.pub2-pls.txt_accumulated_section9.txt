Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of schizophrenia
Review Question  Is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) useful in treating people with schizophrenia? 
Background 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new and sophisticated device‐based therapy. TMS involves the skilful application of a strong magnetic field close to the surface of the scalp. The TMS device delivers strong and very brief magnetic pulses that stimulate the brain and its network of neurons. TMS is a relatively painless and non‐invasive technique that stimulates parts of the brain (the cerebral cortex). Brain activity has been shown to differ in people with schizophrenia compared to other people. 
People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations), which fail to fully respond to medication. TMS has been proposed as a new treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations. Antipsychotic medication also often has debilitating side effects, such as weight gain, apathy or lack or drive, and shaking. TMS could be an alternative treatment for people who do not cope well with standard medication. 
Description of Studies 
A search for trials was run in 2013 and 41 randomised controlled studies are now included in this review. The studies included people diagnosed with schizophrenia and randomised participants to receive either temporoparietal TMS, prefrontal TMS, sham TMS or standard care. 
Results 
At this time, there is not strong evidence to support the use of TMS to treat schizophrenia. Some very low‐quality evidence appears to tentatively indicate that TMS may improve global state and certain symptoms such as hearing voices, compared to sham TMS. However, the research at present is not robust, consistent and standardised enough to support any firm conclusions about using TMS for schizophrenia.
