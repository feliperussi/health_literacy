Early full enteral feeds for preterm or low birth weight infants
Review question: do preterm or low birth weight infants (babies born early or small) grow faster and have fewer problems when they receive all their nutrients as milk feeds from shortly after birth (compared with gradually introducing milk feeds while giving fluid or nutrients via an intravenous drip (a slow infused into the bloodstream via a vein))? 
Background: 'early full enteral feeding' means that preterm or low birth weight infants receive all their nutrition as milk feeds from shortly after birth, and do not receive any supplemental fluids or nutrition via intravenous drips. Assessing whether this approach is safe and beneficial is particularly relevant to feeding very preterm or very low birth weight infants (born before 32 weeks, or birth weigh less than 1500 g). 
Study characteristics: we included six trials, all undertaken in neonatal care units in India during the 2010s. The trials were generally good quality although most were small (involving 526 infants in total). Participants were preterm infants of birth weight 1000 g to 1500 g. 
The search is up to date as of July 2020.
Key results: there were insufficient data to show whether infants who received full milk feeds from birth put on weight and grew more quickly than those for whom feeds were introduced gradually during the first week or two after birth. The trials reported no information about the effects early full milk feeds might have on development and growth later in the baby's life. The included trials found no evidence of other potential benefits or harms of early full feeds, including any effects on feeding or bowel problems.
