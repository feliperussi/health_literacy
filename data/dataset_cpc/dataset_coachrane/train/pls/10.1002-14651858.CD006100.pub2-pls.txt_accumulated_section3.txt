Does adding antileukotriene agents to usual care when people are suffering an asthma attack in the emergency department help? 
Current recommended treatment in the emergency department for people experiencing an asthma attack is beta2‐agonists, systemic corticosteroids and oxygen. Unfortunately, some people do not get better with these standard treatments and so there is interest in developing additional treatments which will help people experiencing an asthma attack. One such treatment is antileukotrienes, which are available in tablet form to be taken orally; this drug is also made in injection form, however the intravenous form is not marketed and therefore not available. 
This review considers the effect of antileukotriene agents, (normally used as add‐on preventer therapy in chronic asthma), when used during acute asthma treated in emergency settings. We identified eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 1470 adults and 470 children addressing this question, and in most of these studies participants were also given courses of corticosteroids at the time of treatment. We did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of being admitted to hospital between people treated with oral antileukotrienes and placebo or usual care. There was no significant difference in participants requiring additional care (including hospital admission or other treatment options) at the end of the studies between treatment and control groups. There was an improvement in lung function in people taking antileukotrienes compared to those on placebo. More research in this area is required, and the low number of studies recruiting children does not enable us to provide evidence on what effects this class of drugs has in children.
