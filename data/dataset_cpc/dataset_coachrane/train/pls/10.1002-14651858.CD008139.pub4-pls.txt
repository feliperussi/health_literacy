Antiviral treatment for influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We looked for evidence for the use of antiviral treatment against influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic, life‐threatening disorder which affects many organs in the body. and people with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of chronic lung disease. Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications. During a pandemic (an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people), flu symptoms may be more severe and complications more frequent. Severe cases of pandemic flu have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions including people with cystic fibrosis. Although there is no evidence that people with cystic fibrosis are more likely to contract this infection than healthy people, the impact for them could be greater and the outcome worse as the lower airways are more often affected. Antiviral agents are important in managing influenza and include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. These drugs can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 02 November 2015.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies looking at the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Key results 
Limited data from previous studies have shown that these drugs can be effective in healthy people and may be useful in high‐risk populations if used rationally. However, we are not able to answer the question of the safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza in people with cystic fibrosis.
