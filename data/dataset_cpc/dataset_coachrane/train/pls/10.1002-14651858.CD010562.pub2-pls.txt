Topical treatment with a blood‐clot promoting drug to reduce bleeding
Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide suffer ill health caused by severe bleeding. Tranexamic acid is a drug that helps blood to clot and so it could help people who are bleeding. We already know that giving tranexamic acid intravenously (directly into the vein) reduces bleeding in accident victims and in patients having operations. But some doctors don't always give it this way because they are worried that it might have bad side effects in certain patients, such as causing blood clots where they are not wanted. An alternative way to give this drug is to mix it with sterile water and apply it directly to the bleeding surface (this is known as 'topical' application). Because less of the drug might be absorbed into the body when it is given this way, it could be less likely to have bad side effects. 
This review looked at trials assessing the effects of topical tranexamic acid in patients who are bleeding. Twenty‐nine trials were found; 28 involved patients bleeding during operations and one involved people with nosebleeds. When the results of these trials were gathered together they showed that when tranexamic acid was given topically, it reduced the amount of blood that patients lost and made it less likely that they had a blood transfusion. 
The authors of this review concluded that topical tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in patients who are having an operation. But because there are no trials, we are not sure if it also reduces bleeding from other causes, such as childbirth or bleeding from stomach ulcers.
