Intrastromal corneal ring segments for keratoconus
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intrastromal corneal ring segments as treatment for keratoconus. Intrastromal corneal ring segments are small, crescent‐shaped plastic rings that are placed in the cornea (the clear, front surface of the eye) to treat keratoconus. Keratoconus is a worsening disease of the eye in which the normally round cornea bulges into a cone‐like shape with irregular surface, causing distorted vision.Studies that evaluated uncorrected vision with intrastromal corneal rings were searched for, and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that fit the protocol's inclusion criteria were identified. 
Key message In the absence of eligible RCTs on this topic, the effectiveness and safety of intrastromal corneal ring segments as treatment for keratoconus is uncertain. 
what was studied in this review? It was important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intrastromal corneal ring segments as treatment for keratoconus, a rare and progressive disease of the cornea. Keratoconus often affects both eyes, causing protrusion of the eyes leading to the outer surface becoming irregular and distorted. It can sometimes lead to scarring of the cornea, resulting in blurry vision, even with visual correction. When contact lenses or spectacles are no longer effective enough at correcting vision, intrastromal corneal ring segments are used. 
What are the main results of this review? We found no studies meeting our inclusion criteria, and therefore no conclusion could be drawn regarding the effectiveness and safety of intrastromal corneal ring segments as treatment for people with keratoconus. Studies are needed that compare people who undergo intrastromal corneal ring segments as treatment for keratoconus to those individuals who did not receive intrastromal corneal ring segments.
