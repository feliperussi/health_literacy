Oral ibuprofen for acute treatment of episodic tension‐type headache in adults
Frequent episodic tension‐type headache (TTH) means having between one and 14 headaches per month. The condition causes much disability, and stops people concentrating and working properly. When headaches occur the pain usually goes away over time. 
Ibuprofen is a commonly‐used painkiller available without prescription in most parts of the world. The usual dose is 400 mg taken by mouth. 
We searched the literature in January 2015 and found 12 studies involved 3094 participants. Of these, about 1800 were included in comparisons between ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo. Others involved lower doses of ibuprofen, or different types of ibuprofen, or were in comparisons with other active drugs. 
The outcome preferred by the International Headache Society (IHS) is being pain free after two hours. This outcome was reported by 23 in 100 people taking ibuprofen 400 mg, and in 16 out of 100 taking placebo. The result was statistically significant, but only 7 people (23 minus 16) in 100 benefited specifically because of ibuprofen 400 mg. 
The IHS also suggests a range of other outcomes, but few were reported consistently enough for them to be used. People with pain value an outcome of having no worse than mild pain, but this was not reported by any study. 
About 4 in 100 people taking ibuprofen 400 mg had an adverse event with ibuprofen, the same as with placebo. There were no serious adverse events. 
There are questions about how studies in this type of headache are conducted. These questions involve the type of people chosen for the studies, and the outcomes reported. This limits the usefulness of the results, especially for people who just have an occasional headache.
