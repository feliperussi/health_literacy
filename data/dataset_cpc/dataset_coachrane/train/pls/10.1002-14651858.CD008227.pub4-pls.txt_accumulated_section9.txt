Pancreatic enzyme supplements for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about how good pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is in overcoming the enzyme deficiency in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and if there are any side effects. 
Background 
Between 80% and 90% of people with CF take PERT because their pancreas can not make the enzymes needed to digest food. As a result, children may fail to gain weight and thrive; while adults may lose weight and become malnourished as they do not absorb vitamins properly. In people with CF, malnutrition is linked to poorer general health, more severe lung disease and shorter life expectancy. If their pancreas is not making enough enzymes, people with CF can also experience painful, frequent, bulky, offensive bowel movements. PERT is needed to help gain weight, prevent malnutrition and avoid some vitamin deficiencies, as well as to control bowel symptoms. This is an updated version of the review.

Study characteristics 
We assessed 14 trials (641 adults and children with CF); 13 trials gave treatment for four weeks and one for seven weeks. Trials compared different formulations of PERT, some were treated to delay the release of the medication until they passed from the stomach into the intestine, while others were not. In 12 trials participants took both types of supplement for four weeks each, although the order in which they took them was random. These factors made it difficult to analyse trial results. Most of the trials were old; the most recent was from 2017, but the oldest was from 1986.
