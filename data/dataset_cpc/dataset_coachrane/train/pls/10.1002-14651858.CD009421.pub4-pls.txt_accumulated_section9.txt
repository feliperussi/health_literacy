Drugs to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence to find out the effects of individual drugs or combinations of drugs when they are given to prevent donor lungs being rejected following transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis. We only considered randomised studies (where it is decided at random which drug volunteers are given) comparing individual drugs or combinations of drugs to a placebo (dummy treatment with no active medicine) or to each other. 
Background 
Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged. However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it. This is known as graft rejection. To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation. There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system. Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all people who have had a lung transplant and not specifically on those with cystic fibrosis. Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using anti‐rejection drugs in people with cystic fibrosis after they have received a lung transplant.

Study characteristics 
Although we found five studies which looked at anti‐rejection drugs, they included people with a number of chronic conditions and not just cystic fibrosis.
