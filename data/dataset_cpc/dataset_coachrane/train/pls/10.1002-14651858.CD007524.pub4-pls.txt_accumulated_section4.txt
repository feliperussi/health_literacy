Increasing the dose of inhaled steroids or continuing the usual dose to treat asthma attacks in adults and children 
Background  Previous asthma treatment guidelines recommended doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an asthma attack as part of an action plan. We looked for all studies that have assessed whether such an increase is better than and is as safe as carrying on with the usual ICS dose. 
Study characteristics  This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. We performed the most recent searches in March 2016. In total, we found eight studies involving 1669 people with mild or moderate asthma. Three were conducted in children, and five in adults. These studies provided participants with an inhaler that contained extra doses of ICS (to increase their usual ICS dose) or a placebo that could be used if their symptoms worsened. Participants were then followed for six months to one year to see whether people taking more inhaled corticosteroids during attacks did better than those who took a placebo. 
Key results  People taking an increased dose of ICS during an attack did not do better than those who took a placebo, regardless of whether we looked at all study participants or only those who actually took the inhalers during an attack. Results showed a lot of variation in studies that focused only on people who took the inhalers, with some studies showing benefit of increasing ICS dose and others showing no benefit. It is unlikely that increasing ICS dose reduces the need for a course of oral steroids to treat the attack, prevents the need for an emergency visit with doctors or at the hospital or reduces the time it takes to recover. We cannot be sure of these last results because few studies reported them. Use of either strategy was not associated with significantly more or less serious and non‚Äêserious side effects, but again we cannot say for sure because we did not find enough studies.
