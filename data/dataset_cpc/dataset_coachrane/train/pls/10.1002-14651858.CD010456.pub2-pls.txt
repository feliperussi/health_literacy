Is water‐based exercise an effective and safe type of exercise for adults with asthma?
Asthma is a common condition in which inflammation and narrowing of the air conducting tubes may cause intermittent symptoms, possibly limiting activities of daily life. Some adults believe that exercise could trigger an asthma attack. However, research has shown the opposite—that adults who exercise may have less chance of having an asthma attack, and taking exercise in water may be more beneficial than taking exercise on land. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the effect and safety of water‐based exercise for adults with asthma. 
We found a total of three studies involving 136 participants with an average age between 33 and 36 years with well‐controlled asthma. They underwent water‐based exercise from 40 to 60 minutes three to five times a week; the programme lasted 10 to 24 weeks in two studies, and one day only in one study. 
We considered data reported on quality of life, asthma general symptoms or asthma exacerbations, measure of lung function (FEV1, forced expiratory volume of the lung in the first second of air expired) and adverse events. The quality of evidence is very low because of issues with selection of participants, small number of participants, differences in exercise duration and intensity and differences in levels of asthma. Often surrogate endpoints were measured instead of patient‐important outcomes. 
To sum up, more studies are needed to find out the effect and safety of water‐based exercise for adults with asthma. The quality of evidence is very low because of issues with selection of participants, differences in exercise duration and intensity and differences in levels of asthma; surrogate endpoints were measured instead of patient‐important outcomes.
