Tranexamic acid to help treat nosebleeds (epistaxis)
Background 
Nosebleeds are a very common condition, with the majority of those affected either children or those over the age of 60. They usually stop on their own or by simply compressing the nose with fingers, although a small number require medical attention. This will involve either cauterising (sealing) the bleeding vessel, if it can be seen, or packing the inside of the nose with a material to cause pressure to build up and stop the bleeding ('usual care'). Occasionally bleeding continues despite these measures, or it restarts having initially been controlled. This can lead to a prolonged hospital stay and the possibility of further procedures such as repacking with a different type of nasal pack or an operation. 
Tranexamic acid is a drug that is known to help promote blood clotting by preventing a natural process called fibrinolysis (dissolution of a clot). It is already used in a number of situations where bleeding is a significant worry, such as after heart surgery or major trauma. It can be given by mouth (orally), directly to the bleeding site (topically) or by injection into a vein (intravenously). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials in patients of any age with nosebleed requiring intervention. Patients were treated with tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other agent used to stop bleeding. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 692 participants. Two studies used oral administration of tranexamic acid and four used topical administration. All participants in the studies were adults. Three of the six studies were conducted over 20 years ago.
