There was low‐quality evidence to suggest that couple therapy is as effective as individual psychotherapy in improving depression. People with depression might do better when receiving couple therapy compared with no treatment, but we are very uncertain about this effect because of the very low quality of studies. In comparison with treatment with antidepressant medication, limited data was available. Although data on few dropouts favour couple therapy, the very low quality of data seriously weakens this finding. The comparison between couple therapy plus antidpressant medication and antidepressants alone showed no difference in depressive symptom level, but the results were based on two small studies. Couple therapy was more effective in reducing relationship distress than individual psychotherapy and this effect was enhanced when distressed couples were considered separately. However, this result has to be considered with great caution, because of the very low quality of studies. Most studies were affected by small sample sizes, unclear sample representativeness, loss of participants at follow‐up, and investigators' allegiance bias. Moreover, there were few follow‐ups that went beyond 6 months post‐treatment. Only one study tested whether improvements in couple relationships led to improvement in depression, finding supporting evidence for that. However, the small sample of this study and the lack of other studies which investigated this hypothesis means we could not test in this review if this finding was supported. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence on differences between couple therapy and other treatments for depression, the possibility of improvement in couple relationships may favour its choice when relationship distress is a major problem.
