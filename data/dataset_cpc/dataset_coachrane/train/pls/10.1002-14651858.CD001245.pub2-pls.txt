Drugs for preventing blood clot dissolution (antifibrinolytic therapy) to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage 
A subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a bleed into the small space between the brain and skull that contains blood vessels that supply the brain (the subarachnoid space). The cause of a bleeding here is usually a rupture of a weak spot in one of these vessels. A SAH is a relatively uncommon type of stroke, but it often occurs at a young age (half the patients are younger than 50 years). The outcome of SAH is often poor: one‐third of people die after the haemorrhage and of those who survive, one‐fifth will require help for everyday activities. An important cause of poor recovery after SAH is a second bleed from the weakened vessel (rebleeding). This is thought to be caused by the dissolving of the blood clot at the original bleeding site that results from natural blood clot dissolving (fibrinolytic) activity. Antifibrinolytic therapy that reduces this activity was introduced as a treatment for reducing rebleeding and therefore for improving recovery after SAH. This review included 10 trials, totaling 1904 participants that investigated the effect of these drugs in people with SAH. Antifibrinolytic treatment does indeed reduce the risk of rebleeding, but does not improve survival or the chance of being independent in everyday activities. This may be due to an increase in one of the other common complications of SAH. We conclude that antifibrinolytic treatment should not routinely be given to people with SAH, but new randomised trials are needed to establish if short‐term treatment might be beneficial.
