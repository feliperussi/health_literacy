Omega 3 fatty acids for preventing and slowing the progression of age‐related macular degeneration 
Review question  We asked the question whether increased dietary intake of omega 3 fatty acids prevented or slowed the progression of age‐related macular degeneration. 
Background  Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that affects the central area of the retina (light‐sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). AMD is associated with a loss of detailed vision and adversely affects tasks such as reading, driving and face recognition. In the absence of a cure, there has been considerable interest in the role of modifiable risk factors to prevent or slow down the progression of AMD. Evidence from population studies suggests that people who have a diet with relatively high levels of omega 3 fatty acids (such as those derived from fish oils) are less likely to develop AMD. 
Study characteristics  We searched for studies up to 2 February 2015. We identified two trials with a total of 2343 participants. The trials were conducted in the USA and France and investigated the use of fish oil supplements in people with AMD who were at high risk of progressing to advanced disease. We judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. One study was funded by government grants and the other study was funded by the manufacturer of the dietary supplement. 
Key results  These studies found that omega 3 supplementation for periods up to five years did not reduce the rate of progression to advanced AMD or reduce significant visual loss compared to a placebo. The incidence of adverse effects was similar in the intervention and placebo groups.
