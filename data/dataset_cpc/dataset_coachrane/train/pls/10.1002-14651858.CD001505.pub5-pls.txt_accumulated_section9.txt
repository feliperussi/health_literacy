Treatment with oral drugs other than steroids to reduce lung inflammation and deterioration in lung function in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence to see if drugs that were not steroids could reduce inflammation in the lungs and stop lung function getting worse in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Inflammation in the lungs increases the damage done to them and is the most common reason for early death in people with cystic fibrosis. In high doses, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen, may work against inflammation, but in low doses there is some evidence that they may cause the inflammation. The use of high doses has also raised concerns about the potential for unwanted effects, which has limited the use of these drugs in cystic fibrosis.

Study characteristics 
We looked for trials comparing oral non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs to a a placebo (a tablet that contained no active medicine). We looked for any dose level. but the trial had to run for at least two months in people with cystic fibrosis. We found 17 trials and included four of these with a total of 287 people aged five to 39 years; one further trial has not yet been published in full and two are still ongoing; we will assess these when we have more information. Three of the four included trials compared ibuprofen to a placebo; two of these trials were run in the same center and used some of the same people. One trial compared a drug called piroxicam to placebo. The longest trial lasted four years.
