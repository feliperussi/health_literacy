Very low quality evidence suggests that steroids may be more effective than enteral nutrition for induction of remission in adults with active Crohn's disease. Very low quality evidence also suggests that enteral nutrition may be more effective than steroids for induction of remission in children with active Crohn's disease. There was no difference in remission rates between elemental and non‐elemental diets. An increase in side effects was not seen with elemental diets compared to non‐elemental diets, nor with enteral nutrition compared to steroids. Common side effects experienced with enteral nutrition included vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn and flatulence . Common side effects associated with steroid use included acne, moon facies, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) . Patients on enteral nutrition were more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those on steroids. The most common reason for study withdrawal was inability to tolerate the taste of the enteral nutrition diet. Enteral nutrition should be considered in pediatric Crohn's patients or in adult patients who can comply with nasogastric tube feeding or perceive the formulations to be palatable, or when steroid side effects are not tolerated or better avoided. Further research is required to confirm the superiority of corticosteroids over EN in adults. Further research is required to confirm the benefit of EN in children. More effort from industry should be taken to develop palatable polymeric formulations that can be delivered without use of a nasogastric tube as this may lead to increased patient compliance with this therapy.
