What are the main benefits and risks of drugs for reducing blood pressure in the treatment of people with thickening of the heart muscle caused by high blood pressure? 
Key messages 
Given the lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of adding additional drugs for reducing blood pressure to treat people with thickening of the heart muscle and high blood pressure are unclear. 
It is unclear if adding drugs for reducing blood pressure causes more serious harms in patients than placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment; however, it may increase treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects. 
There is a need for future studies to better understand the benefits and harms of adding drugs for reducing blood pressure in people with thickening of the heart muscle caused by high blood pressure. 
What is thickening of the heart muscle? 
Thickening of the heart muscle is a condition where the muscle gets bigger and affects the function of the heart. This can happen when the heart has worked too hard over time and is mainly caused by high blood pressure. People with thickening of the heart muscle can experience shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, heart palpitations, and dizziness or fainting. 
How is thickening of the heart muscle treated? 
Thickening of the heart muscle can be treated with drugs for reducing blood pressure.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if adding drugs for reducing blood pressure was better than placebo or no drug treatment at preventing illness and death in people with thickening of the heart muscle and high blood pressure.
