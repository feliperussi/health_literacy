Platelet transfusion before surgery for people with low platelet counts
Review question 
We aimed to assess the safety and clinical effectiveness of administrating platelet transfusions to people with a low platelet count who require surgery. We included three comparisons: giving platelet transfusion versus no platelet transfusion; giving platelet transfusion versus an alternative treatment (medicines that reduce the risk of bleeding or increase the platelet count) or giving platelet transfusions when the platelet count is below a set number (low platelet count e.g. 20 × 109/L versus slightly higher e.g. 50 × 109/L). 
Our target population was people with a low platelet count of any age who required surgery. We excluded studies on people with a low platelet count who were actively bleeding. 
Key messages 
There was not enough evidence to help guide the use of platelet transfusions prior to surgery in people with a low platelet count. There is no evidence for infants and children or prior to a major operation. 
What was studied in this review? 
Platelets are tiny cells in the blood that form clots to help stop bleeding. If a person with a low platelet counts requires surgery they are at increased risk of bleeding during and after surgery. A number of strategies are used to reduce the risk of bleeding, these include: giving platelet transfusions (injecting platelets into the bloodstream) to increase the platelet count, giving medicines to increase the platelet count and giving medicines that reduce the risk of bleeding. The current strategies are not based on good evidence, but based on individual clinical experience and expertise.
