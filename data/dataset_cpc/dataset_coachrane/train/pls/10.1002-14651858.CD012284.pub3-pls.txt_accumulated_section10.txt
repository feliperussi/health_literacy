Growth hormone therapy for people with thalassaemia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treating people with thalassaemia with growth hormones. 
Background 
Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes anaemia of varying severity. People who have the more severe forms of thalassaemia need regular blood transfusions from early childhood resulting in excess iron accumulating in vital organs such as the heart, liver and hormone‐secreting glands (endocrine glands). One of the glands at risk is the pituitary gland which secretes growth hormone which in turn regulates the growth and function of the human body. If the production of growth hormone is disrupted by iron deposition, the affected children may not grow very tall. 
Short stature is very common amongst people with thalassaemia. It may be caused by various factors including problems with growth hormone or other hormones, insufficient blood transfusions or poor nutrition. Synthetic growth hormone is one way of treating short stature in thalassaemia, especially in children with defective growth hormone production. This usually involves an injection of growth hormone under the skin (subcutaneously) several days a week over a period of time. However, it is unclear whether the use of synthetic growth hormone provides any consistent or clear benefits to people with thalassaemia.

In this update, we included evidence current to 14 November 2019.
Study characteristics 
We found only one small trial for our review. It included 20 children with beta thalassaemia who were considerably shorter than they should be based on growth charts. Ten of the children were randomly selected to receive daily growth hormone treatment in addition to their usual (standard) treatment and the other 10 children just had their usual treatment. Investigators recorded the height of the children and did blood tests every three months. The trial was conducted over a one‐year period.
