Interventions for orbital lymphangioma
What is the aim of this review? We planned this Cochrane Review to analyze the effectiveness, recurrence rate, and side effects of the four major interventions used to treat orbital lymphangiomas including: observation (watching without intervention until the lymphangioma caused problems such as a decrease in vision or inability to close the eye); sclerotherapy (injections into the lesion that scar the lesion into a smaller size); medications taken by mouth; and surgery. The goal was to establish the relative effectiveness of treatment as measured by symptom improvement (such as droopy eyelid or swelling), decreasing lesion size, and quality of life improvement. 
Key messages Currently, there are no eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment options for orbital lymphangioma. Therefore, the effectiveness, recurrence rate, and side effects of the four major interventions used to treat orbital lymphangiomas remains uncertain. 
What was studied in this review? Lymphangiomas are localized malformations of the vascular and lymphatic system that most commonly occur in the head and neck regions of children. Lymphangiomas of the orbit (eye socket) typically present in children under the age of 16 years old with ptosis (droopy eyelid), swelling around the eye area, or with bleeding within the lesion from a minor injury. People with this condition can also present with other symptoms such as cosmetic deformity, proptosis (protrusion of the eye), restriction of eye movement (an eye that looks like it is wandering and can lead to vision loss in a child), compression of the optic nerve (a type of vision loss), and amblyopia (another type of vision loss) in children. Due to these vision‚Äêthreatening complications, early and effective treatment is crucial in preventing cosmetic disfigurement, pain, and visual impairment.
