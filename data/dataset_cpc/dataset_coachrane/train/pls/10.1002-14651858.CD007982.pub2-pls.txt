Email used by health professionals to send patients/caregivers information on promoting health and preventing disease 
Email is widely used in many sectors and lots of people use it in their day to day lives. The use of email in health care is not yet common. One use for it is for health professionals to send patients/caregivers information on how to be healthy and avoid disease. This review examines how patients, healthcare professionals and health services may be affected by using email in this way. 
We found that there was not much evidence on the effects of using email to give people information on disease prevention and health promotion. We found only six trials with 8372 participants in total. All of the trials had elements of bias. Four studies compared email to standard mail as a method of communication, and found that using email instead of mail did not make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding, or the uptake of preventive screening. Two studies compared email with usual care, and found that using email instead of usual methods of information delivery did make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding and support, or patient health status and well‚Äêbeing. We were unable to properly assess email's impact on patient or caregiver behaviours/actions as the results were mixed. 
As there is a lack of good quality evidence for whether email can be used by healthcare professionals to provide information to patients or caregivers on how to stay healthy and avoid disease, we need to think about how to get good measurable information on this. Future studies should follow advice on good ways of carrying out and presenting research. It would be useful if they could look at the costs of using email and take into account ongoing changes in technology.
