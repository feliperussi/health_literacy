Multidisciplinary treatment for back pain
Review question 
Is treatment involving a team of therapists from several different clinical professions helpful for people with long‚Äêterm back pain? 
Background 
Low back pain (LBP) is a condition that causes a great deal of pain and suffering across the world and also accounts for large costs to society due to healthcare spending and missed work. Previous research has shown that LBP that has persisted for several months or years is often associated with psychological and social problems. Multidisciplinary treatments target physical as well as psychological and social aspects of LBP and involve a team of healthcare providers with different professional backgrounds and training. 
Study characteristics 
We collected all the published studies up to February 2014; there were 41 studies (with 6858 participants) that compared multidisciplinary treatment to other treatments. Most studies compared a multidisciplinary treatment to usual care (such as care by a general practitioner) or to treatments that only addressed physical factors (such as exercise or physiotherapy). All the people in the studies had LBP for more than three months and most had received some other sort of treatment previously. 
Key results 
There was moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary treatment results in larger improvements in pain and daily function than usual care or treatments aimed only at physical factors. The difference was not very large, about 1 point on a 10 point scale for pain, but this may be important for people whose symptoms have not responded to other treatments. There was also moderate evidence that multidisciplinary treatment doubled the likelihood that people were able to work in the next 6 to 12 months compared to treatments aimed at physical factors.
