Prolotherapy injections for chronic low‐back pain
Chronic low‐back pain is a very common problem for which there is currently no universally effective treatment. Patients with chronic low‐back pain have many treatment options and it is important for them to understand the evidence behind each treatment option they may be considering. Prolotherapy injections have been used to treat chronic low‐back pain for over 50 years but their use remains controversial. They involve repeatedly injecting ligaments with compounds such as dextrose (sugar) and lidocaine (anaesthetic) to help restart the body's natural healing process by causing controlled acute inflammation (swelling) in the areas injected. Proponents believe this leads to stronger ligaments that can better support the low‐back. Prolotherapy injections are often combined with other treatments such as spinal manipulation, exercises, and corticosteroid injections into tender muscles to maximize its effect. 
This review included five studies that examined the effects of prolotherapy injections on 366 patients with low‐back pain that had lasted for longer than three months. Because these studies used different types of prolotherapy injections and different treatment protocols, their results could not be combined. The five studies we examined were therefore divided according to whether they used prolotherapy injections alone or combined prolotherapy injections with spinal manipulation, exercise, and other treatments. Of the five studies we reviewed, three found that prolotherapy injections alone were not an effective treatment for chronic low‐back pain and two found that a combination of prolotherapy injections, spinal manipulation, exercises, and other treatments can help chronic low‐back pain and disability. Minor side effects such as increased back pain and stiffness were common but short‐lived. Based on these five studies, the role of prolotherapy injections for chronic low‐back pain is still not clear.
