Screening women for gestational diabetes in pregnancy based on whether they are considered at risk, and in different settings 
What is the issue? 
What are the effects of screening all women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), compared with only screening those who are 'at risk'? What are the effects of screening women for GDM in different settings (such as in the community versus the hospital)? This review updates a Cochrane Review, first published in 2010, and subsequently updated in 2014. 
Why is this important? 
GDM is a form of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy, and can increase the risk of complications for mothers and their babies. Women with GDM are more likely to develop pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and require a caesarean section. For babies, potential problems include being large for gestational age (growing larger than they normally would), or having hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) after birth. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, mothers and their babies are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. 
Treating GDM can improve health outcomes. Women often do not know they have GDM. Screening to identify and treat GDM in pregnant women may therefore improve outcomes. The two main approaches are 'universal' where all women undergo screening; and 'selective' or 'risk factor'‐based where only those women 'at risk' are screened. The risk factors for GDM include certain ethnicities, being older, overweight or obese, having had a previous large baby, or a family history of GDM or type 2 diabetes. It possible to screen for GDM in different settings, such as in the community (e.g. a general practice clinic) or in hospital. The ideal screening method for GDM that leads to the best health outcomes for mothers and their babies remains unclear.
