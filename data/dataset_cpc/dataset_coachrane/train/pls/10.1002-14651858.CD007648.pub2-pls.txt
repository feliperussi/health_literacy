Balance training (proprioceptive training) for rheumatoid arthritis.
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of balance training on rheumatoid arthritis.   The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis: 
We are unsure of the effects of balance training because no studies met the review's inclusion criteria. Further randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of balance exercises (proprioceptive training) alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is balance training? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of falls due to impairments in the legs and feet which can lead to instability. 
Balance training is a set of exercises in which participants use their muscles against an external force as a planned movement or in response to an unexpected movement or changes in order to maintain their balance. Balance exercises and positions can include feet together, semi and tandem position, one leg stance, unstable platforms or foams, eyes opened and closed. In addition, balance training can include some coordination and agility exercises such as: shuttle walk, tandem walk, crossover walk, side‐to‐side walk and figure of eight.
