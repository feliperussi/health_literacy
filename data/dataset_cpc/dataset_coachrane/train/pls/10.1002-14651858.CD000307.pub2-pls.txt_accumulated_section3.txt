Depot fluphenazine decanoate and enanthate for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs, which can be taken by mouth (tablet) or by an injection (depot). Fluphenazine was one of the first antipsychotic to be produced in depot form. The depot comes in two forms (decanoate and enanthate). Depot injections are often used for people who refuse or forget to take tablets (showing poor compliance or adherence with medication). Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic drug that is very effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, when compared to newer antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine may have serious side effects (such as involuntary shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness and the inability to sit still) and is known to lower people’s mood. 
This review aimed to investigate the effects of fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) for schizophrenia. Searches for relevant randomised controlled trials was run in February 2011 and October 16, 2013. Authors could include and extract data from 73 studies with a total of 4870 participants. There were more studies on fluphenazine decanoate than enanthate.The review authors rated the quality of the evidence in the included trials to be low or very low. A long‐term result from only one trial indicated fluphenazine decanoate reduces the rate of relapse when compared with placebo (‘dummy treatment’). Three studies found that fluphenazine decanoate produced fewer general movement disorders than oral antipsychotics. However, other results showed, overall, the effects and outcomes, including adverse effects for fluphenazine (decanoate and enanthate) are similar to other oral and depot antipsychotics. Important outcomes and information about use of services, going into hospital, satisfaction with care and costs were not reported in any study.
