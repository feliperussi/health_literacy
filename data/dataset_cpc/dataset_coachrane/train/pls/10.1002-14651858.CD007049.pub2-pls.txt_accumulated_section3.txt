Wound infiltration with local anaesthetic agents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (local anaesthetic administration into the surgical wound in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy) 
Background  About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as a port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered to be less painful than open surgery, pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent people from feeling pain) into the surgical wound (local anaesthetic wound infiltration) may be an effective way of decreasing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the benefits and harms of local anaesthetic wound infiltration is not known. We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials on the benefits related to the treatment. When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. We also considered comparative non‐randomised studies for treatment‐related harms. Two authors searched the literature until February 2013 and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors. 
Study characteristics  We identified 19 randomised clinical trials in this review. Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
