Motivational interviewing for improving recovery after stroke
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of motivational interviewing in people with stroke. We found one study. 
Background 
Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety are common complications following stroke that can cause stroke survivors to lack the motivation to take part in activities of daily living or rehabilitation. Motivational interviewing is a counselling method that is designed to help people to change their behaviour through discovering and resolving their conflicts by a standardised communication skill. It provides a specific way for enhancing their expectations and beliefs of recovery following stroke. We wanted to know whether motivational interviewing was an effective treatment to improve activities of daily living after stroke. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2015. Only one study met our criteria: it involved a total of 411 stroke patients aged 18 years and over who had received either motivational interviewing or usual care between five and 28 days after stroke; the follow‚Äêup period was 12 months. Motivational interviewing consisted of one session per week for four individual sessions, with each session lasting for 30 to 60 minutes. 
Key results 
The evidence we found from a single study was insufficient to support the use of motivational interviewing for improving activities of daily living after stroke, but participants receiving motivational interviewing were more likely to have a normal mood than those who received usual care. 
Quality of the evidence 
We assessed the included study to be at some risk of bias in methodological quality, as blinding of investigators and participants was impossible.
