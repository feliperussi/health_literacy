Use of rapid point‐of‐care testing for strep throat to guide doctors prescribing antibiotics for sore throat in primary care settings 
Review question 
Can rapid point‐of‐care tests help reduce antibiotic use in people with acute sore throat in primary care? 
Background 
Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for primary care visits. It can be caused by viruses or bacteria. The bacterial species most frequently identified in cases of sore throat is group A streptococcus (’strep throat’). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for people with a sore throat, even though the majority of sore throats are caused by viruses, in which case antibiotics are ineffective and unnecessary. The concern is that antibiotics may cause side effects and contribute to antibiotic resistance, causing difficult‐to‐treat infections. It is particularly challenging for physicians to distinguish between sore throats of viral and bacterial origin by observation alone (clinically distinguish), even for experienced physicians. Throat swab cultures may take up to 48 hours to grow. This has led to the development of rapid tests. Several rapid tests are currently available to identify sore throat cases caused by group A streptococcus and can be used by doctors during primary care consultations for sore throat. These rapid tests could help reduce antibiotic prescriptions by withholding antibiotics in people with a negative test result. We assessed the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using rapid tests in primary care.
