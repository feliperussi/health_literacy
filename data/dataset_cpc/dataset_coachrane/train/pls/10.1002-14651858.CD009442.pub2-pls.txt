Therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective therapy after cardiopulmonary arrest in children 
Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is uncommon however the numbers of children who survive are very low. Resulting brain injury in the survivors can be devastating for the child and family. Cooling the patient to a temperature of 32 °C to 34 °C, which is 3 °C to 4 °C below normal (therapeutic hypothermia), has previously been found to improve survival and reduce brain injury in newborn infants who were deprived of oxygen during birth, and also in adults following cardiopulmonary arrest. The causes of cardiopulmonary arrest are different in children than in adults, and asphyxia at birth is also different, so the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the proportion of children who survive or who have brain injury is unclear. 
We therefore conducted a Cochrane systematic review of the literature, searching medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) until December 2011 and contacting international experts for high quality published and unpublished evidence. Our searches failed to find any randomized controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria. However, we found four on‐going trials which, when completed, may contribute to our review. 
At present there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of therapeutic hypothermia within a few hours after return of spontaneous blood flow following cardiopulmonary arrest in children. International resuscitation guidelines currently recommend that doctors consider using the therapy in infants and children although more research is needed to be sure this is the correct recommendation with the lack of treatment options other than supportive care in an intensive care unit that are available.
