Silver‐coated endotracheal tubes (ETTs) for prevention of ventilator‐associated pneumonia in critically ill people 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence of whether silver‐coated endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are effective in reducing the risk of ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital mortality in comparison with standard non‐coated ETTs in people who require mechanical ventilation for 24 hours or longer. 
Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help people breathe when they are very ill and find it difficult to breath on their own. An endotracheal tube is a disposable tube that is inserted into the person's windpipe to allow mechanical ventilation. In mechanical ventilation a machine is used to replace the natural spontaneous breathing and allows air in and out of the lungs. When used for a long period, mechanical ventilation can cause problems for the patient. Mechanical ventilation is associated with complications. Silver is an antimicrobial agent (an agent that kills bacteria) that has been used for many centuries to treat and prevent infections. Silver coating around the ETTs could prevent VAP because of its antimicrobial activity. 
Study characteristics 
We found three randomized controlled trials involving 2081 participants. No outcome data were available for one included study. The design of the other two RCTs was generally good, although there were some weaknesses. The majority of participants were included in centres around North America. The evidence is current to October 2014. Both RCTs were funded but stated that the sponsors contributed only to the study design and did not participate in the conduct of the study.
