Dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors like sitagliptin and vildagliptin are promising new medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They are supposed to improve metabolic control (as measured by lowering blood glucose) without causing severe hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels leading to unconsciousness and other symptoms).  Altogether 12.864 people took part in 25 studies investigating the new compounds sitagliptin and vildagliptin. Most studies lasted 24 weeks, the longest trials evaluated 52 weeks of treatment. So far, no study reported on patient‐oriented parameters like mortality, diabetic complications, costs of treatment and health‐related quality of life. When compared to placebo treatment sitagliptin and vildagliptin improved metabolic control. Comparison with other already established blood‐glucose lowering drugs did not reveal advantages of DPP‐4 treatment. Weight gain was not observed after sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy. Overall, sitagliptin and vildagliptin were well tolerated, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in patients taking sitagliptin or vildagliptin. However, all‐cause infections increased significantly after sitagliptin treatment but did not reach statistical significance following vildagliptin therapy. Unfortunately, all published randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin and vildagliptin only reported routine laboratory safety measurements. Since the new DPP‐4 inhibitors may influence immune function additional long‐term data on the safety of these drugs are necessary. Also, cardiovascular outcomes like heart attacks and strokes should not be increased with any antidiabetic therapy but data so far are lacking. Until new information arrives, DPP‐4 inhibitors should only be used under controlled conditions and in individual patients.
