Parent‐only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years 
Review question 
How effective are diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only in reducing the weight of overweight and obese children? 
Background 
Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems as children and in later life. Parents can play an important role in determining what their children eat. More information is needed about whether helping parents to make changes to their family's diet and lifestyle will treat this problem. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to parents only of 3057 children aged 5 to 11 years. There were few similarities between the trials in the nature and types of interventions used. We grouped the trials by the type of comparisons. Our systematic review reported on the effects of the parent‐only interventions compared with parent and child interventions, waiting list controls (where the intervention was delayed until the end of the trial), other interventions with only minimal information or contact and other types of parent‐only interventions. The children in the included trials were monitored (called follow‐up) for between six months and two years. This evidence is up to date as of March 2015.
