[Does eradication of the organism Helicobacter pylori from the gut of patients with Parkinson's disease improve the absorption of the main drug used to treat patients symptoms?] 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a common infection of the gut and is often associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers. The exact mechanism is unknown but there is some evidence that infection with H pylori can interfere with the absorption of some drugs in the gut. One such drug is levodopa, the main drug used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Whilst levodopa is very effective for treating Parkinson's symptoms, after time it can become less effective in some patients which may be due to variable absorption. If H pylori is eradicated with the use of antibiotics then absorption of levodopa may be improved and in turn the patient's motor symptoms may be improved. 
It is unknown how many people with Parkinson's disease are also infected by H pylori and this needs to be established. We searched the literature for all studies of H pylori and Parkinson's disease and found four studies which reported that between 37% and 59% of Parkinson's disease patients are H pylori‐positive. This is similar to the rate in the general population. 
We used clinical trials to see if treatment of H pylori‐positive Parkinson's disease patients with antibiotics improved the absorption of levodopa and improved their motor symptoms. Only two completed trials were found from our searching. We did not pool these as they had different objectives and used different outcome measures. One of the trials reported a significant increase in levodopa absorption and improvement in motor symptoms when antibiotics were used to eradicate H pylori. The other completed trial did not have any usable results. A further trial of H pylori eradication in Parkinson's disease is still underway and the results, which are due in 2010, will help inform further studies.
