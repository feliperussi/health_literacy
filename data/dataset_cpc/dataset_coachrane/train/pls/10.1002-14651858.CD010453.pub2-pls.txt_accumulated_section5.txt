Aspirin as an additional treatment for giant cell arteritis
Background 
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a condition where inflammation destroys the wall of arterial blood vessels usually seen in the head. GCA affects people over the age of 50 years and is more common as people get older. Early on people feel tired and unwell; they have loss of appetite and can lose weight. Most people then develop a new headache, which can make it uncomfortable to touch their hair and scalp. Some people find chewing food uncomfortable. GCA can cause sudden blindness in one or both eyes. Other rare complications include double vision and life‐threatening aneurysms and stroke. 
Making the diagnosis can be difficult for doctors. Blood tests can help, but not everyone has signs in the blood of raised inflammation. A temporal artery biopsy is recommended. If the biopsy is negative some people still remain on treatment as their clinical story matches the typical disease presentation. 
At diagnosis the emergency treatment is with high‐dose steroids (corticosteroids). Corticosteroids are typically reduced slowly over 12 to 18 months, however some people relapse and need long‐term treatment. Corticosteroids have serious side effects such as weight gain, mood changes, stomach bleeds, bone thinning and fractures. Despite best treatment people can still go blind in one or both eyes. A different drug needs to be found to treat this condition to reduce the risk of blindness, other complications and treatment‐related side effects. Aspirin has been shown to have beneficial effects on the type of inflammation that causes damage in GCA and could therefore help to reduce disease‐related complications.
