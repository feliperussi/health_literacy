Treatments through the artery versus clot‐dissolving drugs for the early treatment of stroke 
Review question 
Are there differences in the safety and effectiveness of treatments delivered into the blocked artery (percutaneous vascular interventions) and clot‐dissolving drugs (intravenous thrombolysis) in the early treatment of stroke. 
Background 
Most strokes are caused by a blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt treatment with clot‐dissolving drugs (thrombolysis) can restore blood flow and prevent brain damage. The development of treatments delivered through a tube into the artery (percutaneous vascular interventions) has led to new possibilities in the treatment of stroke. This approach gives direct access to the blood clot, which can be mechanically removed or dissolved. Despite widespread use of these treatments it is unclear whether they are more effective and safe than clot‐dissolving drugs given by injection (intravenous thrombolysis). 
Study characteristics 
We included four trials with 450 participants randomised to either percutaneous vascular intervention or clot‐dissolving drugs given by injection. 
Search date 
The evidence is current as of September 2017.
Key results 
Compared with clot‐dissolving drugs, percutaneous vascular interventions did not increase the chance of making a good recovery by the end of the trial. There was no significant increase in the risk of dying or of suffering a brain bleed. New, larger trials are needed, particularly because of the rapid development of new techniques and devices for percutaneous vascular interventions. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low because of the limited amount of trial information available.
