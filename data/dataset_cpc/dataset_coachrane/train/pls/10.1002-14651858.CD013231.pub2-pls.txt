The use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) 
Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.
