Medicines for treating painful sickle cell crises in adults
Bottom line 
We are uncertain which medicines provide the best pain relief for adults experiencing a painful sickle cell crisis. 
Background 
People with sickle cell disease have abnormally shaped red cells in their blood. Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder around the world. It is estimated globally that 367 million to 500 million people are carriers. People with sickle cell disease have a higher chance of life‐threatening complications, such as infection, severe chest pain and stroke in early life, and kidney or liver damage in adulthood. 
A pain crisis is the most common problem of sickle cell disease and can require several treatments at once, usually in an emergency situation. The first priority is to control the pain, using medicines (such as opioids, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatories, paracetamol, and blood thinners) or relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice, or acupuncture. 
Study characteristics 
In September 2019, we searched for clinical trials that used medicines in any setting to treat painful sickle cell crises. We found nine trials, with 594 adults (aged 17 to 42 years) who had sickle cell disease, experiencing a combined total of 638 painful episodes. 
Key results 
The studies looked at different comparisons of the medicines butorphanol, cetiedil, fentanyl, ketoprofen, ketorolac, metoclopramide, morphine, paracetamol, placebo, tinzaparin, and tramadol. Only three studies compared the same two drugs (non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, with a placebo (pretend treatment)) and we had very limited data to be able to investigate the effects on pain scores from these medicines.
