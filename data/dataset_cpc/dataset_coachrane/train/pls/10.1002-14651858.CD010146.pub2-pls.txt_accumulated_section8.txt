Yoga in addition to standard care for people with blood or lymph node cancer
Background 
Blood and lymph node cancers are referred to as haematological malignancies. These are types of cancer that affect the blood, bone marrow and other parts of the lymphatic system. The most common ones are lymphomas, leukaemias and myelomas. Depending on the kind of cancer and how far it has spread, there are a lot of different options to manage the disease. Usually chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of both is used to treat the disease. If the cancer is widespread, a transplantation of the patients’ own bone marrow cells combined with an aggressive chemotherapy can be a treatment option. 
People with cancer most commonly experience high emotional distress, anxiety, fatigue, depression and sleeping problems. These symptoms can persist, even when the treatment has ended. In search of ways to manage and cope with such conditions, more and more patients are turning to complementary and alternative therapies. 
Yoga 
Yoga, originating in a thousand year old Indian tradition, is becoming more and more popular. There are hundreds of different styles of yoga, but in the Western world, yoga training mostly consists of three main elements: physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation. An increasing number of cancer patients use yoga as an additional way to improve their well‐being. However, a systematic evaluation about the effects of yoga in the management of haematological malignancies is still missing. 
Objectives 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of yoga on people with haematological malignancies. We also considered overall survival, distress, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep quality and adverse events as important outcomes. We compared people suffering from haematological malignancies treated with yoga and standard cancer care with those treated with standard cancer care only.
