What factors influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines?
Review aim 
This Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence aimed to explore the factors that influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines. To do this, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of parents’ views, experiences, and practices. 
This synthesis complements other Cochrane Reviews assessing the effect of strategies to improve the uptake of childhood vaccination. 
Key messages 
Many factors influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, including those related to individual perceptions, social relationships, and the wider context in which parents live. When parents make decisions about vaccination for their children, they are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify. 
What was studied in this synthesis? 
Childhood vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illnesses and deaths in children. However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations. There are several potential reasons for this. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services. 
Our understanding of what influences parents’ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children is still limited. Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them, and is therefore well‐placed for examining these issues. 
What are the main findings of the review? 
We included 27 studies in our analysis. Studies were conducted in Africa, the Americas, South‐East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific, and included urban and rural settings, as well as high‐, middle‐, and low‐income settings.
