Support for breastfeeding mothers
What is the issue? 
The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be breastfed exclusively until six months of age with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until he or she is at least two years old. We know that breastfeeding is good for the short‐term and long‐term health of both infants and their mothers. Babies are less likely to develop infections in the digestive tract, lungs or airways, and ears. They are also less likely to become overweight and develop diabetes later in life. The mothers are less likely to develop diabetes and to experience breast or ovarian cancer. Many mothers may stop breastfeeding before they want to as a result of the problems they encounter. Good care and support may help women solve these problems so that they can continue to breastfeed. 
Why is this important? 
By knowing what kind of support can be provided to help mothers with breastfeeding, we can help them solve any problems and continue to breastfeed for as long as they want to, wherever they live. Stopping breastfeeding early may cause disappointment and distress for mothers and health problems for themselves and their infants. Support can be in the form of giving reassurance, praise, information, and the opportunity for women to discuss problems and ask questions as needed. This review looked at whether providing extra organised support for breastfeeding mothers would help mothers to continue to breastfeed when compared with standard maternity care. We were interested in support from health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or from trained lay workers such as community health workers and volunteers.
