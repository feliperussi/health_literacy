Are there effective medications for treating depression that does not improve with the first medication used? 
Background 
Depression is a common problem often treated with antidepressant medication. However, many people do not get better with antidepressant treatment and have 'treatment‐resistant depression' (TRD). Several different treatment approaches can be tried ‐ such as increasing the dose of the current medication, adding another medication, or switching to a different antidepressant. 
Cochrane reviewers looked at the available evidence to see which of these options may be the best treatment for people with TRD. 
Search date 
In December 2018, we searched eight medical databases for suitable clinical trials.
Study characteristics 
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 2731 participants (RCTs produce the most robust evidence). These trials investigated three different treatment strategies: 
1. changing to a different antidepressant,
2. adding a second antidepressant to the current antidepressant treatment, or
3. adding a different type of medication to current antidepressant treatment ‐ an anti‐anxiety medication or an antipsychotic 
We found no trials of increasing the dose of current antidepressant medication. Nine of the 10 studies included in this review were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
One small study investigated changing current antidepressant treatment to a different antidepressant (mianserin) or adding mianserin to current treatment. We are uncertain about the effect changing treatment to mianserin has on depressive symptoms or the likelihood of dropping out of treatment. People who added mianserin to their current antidepressant treatment showed fewer depressive symptoms, but the likelihood of dropping out was not clear.
