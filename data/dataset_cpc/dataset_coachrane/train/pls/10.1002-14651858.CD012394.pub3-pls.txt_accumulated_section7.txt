Interventions to prevent women from developing diabetes during pregnancy: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews 
What is the issue? 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) first detected during pregnancy. GDM can affect the health of women and their babies. 
During pregnancy a womanâ€™s body changes how it processes the nutrients from her food, to ensure that the baby is well nourished. In the first three months the mother has increased sensitivity to insulin. In the second and third trimesters her insulin sensitivity is reduced. Women with GDM have less of an initial increase in sensitivity and their insulin sensitivity is reduced beyond normal later in pregnancy, resulting in the mother developing high blood glucose levels. Her blood levels of fats are also higher than normal, which may contribute to the risk of the baby becoming large for its gestational age. 
Why is this important? 
Women with GDM are more likely to develop complications in pregnancy including high blood pressure and need labour to be induced. They are at increased risk later of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born to women with GDM are more likely to be born large, and therefore to experience birth injuries. Once born, the babies are at higher risk of experiencing difficulties in breathing, jaundice and reduced blood sugar levels, and later obesity and diabetes. 
There are many risk factors for GDM, making it likely that interventions before/during pregnancy could reduce the risk of women developing GDM. This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials on interventions that might prevent GDM.
