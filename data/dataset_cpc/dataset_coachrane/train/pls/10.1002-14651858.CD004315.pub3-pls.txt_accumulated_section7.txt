Botulinum toxin for people with involuntary posturing of the head
Undesired, uncontrollable, and often painful placement of the head, a disease called cervical dystonia or spasmodic torticollis, is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can compromise quality of life. Mostly the cause is unknown and no cure exists. As this is typically a chronic disease, it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a natural powerful chemical produced by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum, that can cause severe paralysis in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia, by delivering intra‐muscular Bt injections. There are different types of Bt, not all available for therapeutic purposes. Bt type A (BtA) is normally the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia. However, not all patients respond to BtA injections, and in such situations, treatment with Bt type B (BtB) is of special interest. 
This update of a previous Cochrane review aimed to assess the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtB in cervical dystonia, in comparison to placebo (a pretend medicine). 
We performed a literature search in October 2015 for studies that compared BtB with placebo in people with cervical dystonia. 
We found four studies comparing a single BtB treatment session with placebo, including 441 participants in total. 
There was moderate‐quality evidence that a single BtB treatment session is efficacious when compared to placebo, improving cervical dystonia symptoms by between 10% and 20%. This clinical benefit applies to people with both a poor and a good response to previous BtA treatments. Both physicians and patients evaluated BtB positively. BtB‐treated patients are, however, at an increased risk of dry mouth and swallowing difficulties.
