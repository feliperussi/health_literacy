Regular treatment with formoterol versus regular treatment with salmeterol in chronic asthma: serious adverse events 
Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways – the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an irritant (an asthma trigger), the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten, the airways become narrower, and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. This leads to the symptoms of asthma ‐ wheezing, coughing and difficulty in breathing. They can lead to an asthma attack or exacerbation. People can have underlying inflammation in their lungs and sticky mucus or phlegm may build up, which can further narrow the airways. There is no cure for asthma; however there are medications that allow most people to control their asthma so they can get on with daily life. 
Long‐acting beta2‐agonists, such as formoterol and salmeterol, work by reversing the narrowing of the airways that occurs during an asthma attack. These drugs ‐ taken by inhaler ‐ are known to improve lung function, symptoms, quality of life and reduce the number of asthma attacks. However, there are concerns about the safety of long‐acting beta2‐agonists, particularly in people who are not taking inhaled corticosteroids to control the underlying inflammation. 
We did this review to take a closer look at the safety of people taking formoterol daily compared to salmeterol daily. All participants were prescribed regular background treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. We found three trials on 1116 adults and one trial on 156 children. There was not enough information to draw any conclusions on the relative safety of regular formoterol and regular salmeterol in chronic asthma, but serious asthma‐related events were rare, and only one non‐asthma‐related death was reported.
