Which treatments work best for advanced stomach cancer that has not responded to standard chemotherapy? 
What is advanced stomach cancer? 
Gastric (stomach) cancer usually begins in the mucous‐producing cells lining the stomach. Oesophago‐gastric junction (OGJ) cancer starts where the food pipe (oesophagus) joins the stomach. Advanced cancer is cancer that has spread to nearby tissues, or to another part of the body, despite treatment. 
Treatments for gastric and OGJ cancer include:
• operation to remove the cancer;
• chemotherapy (medicines that kill cancer cells);
• radiotherapy (radiation to kill cancer cells); and
• biological therapy (medicines made from proteins and other substances that occur naturally in the body). 
Biological therapies include immunotherapy (medicines that help the immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells) and therapies that target something in, or surrounding, the cancer, such as the cancer's blood supply. Standard chemotherapy usually combines two medicines containing fluoropyrimidine and platinum. 
When standard chemotherapy for advanced cancer has not worked, further treatment aims to slow the growth of the cancer to help people live longer. Further treatments include: other chemotherapy medicines, biological therapies, and best supportive care (care that helps a person cope with life‐limiting illness and its treatment). 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Stomach and OGJ cancer are difficult to treat. We wanted to find out which treatments work best to control these cancers and help people live longer, when standard chemotherapy has not worked. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at chemotherapy and/or biological therapies for advanced stomach or OGJ cancer that had not responded to standard chemotherapy. We looked for studies in which the treatment each person received was decided at random. These studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatments.
