What factors influence the delivery of care by skilled birth attendants in low‐ and middle‐income countries? 
Review aim 
The aim of this Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence was to identify factors that influence the provision of care by skilled birth attendants. To answer this question, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour. 
This synthesis complements another Cochrane Review assessing the effect of strategies to promote women’s use of healthcare facilities when giving birth. 
Key messages 
Many factors influence the care that skilled birth attendants provide to mothers during childbirth. These include access to training and supervision; staff numbers and workloads; salaries and living conditions; and access to well‐equipped, well‐organised healthcare facilities with water, electricity, and transport. Other factors that may play a role include the existence of teamwork, trust, collaboration, and communication between health workers and with mothers. Skilled birth attendants reported many problems tied to these factors. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many mothers still die during childbirth. Women are encouraged to give birth in health facilities rather than at home so they can receive care from skilled birth attendants. A skilled birth attendant is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is trained to manage a normal pregnancy and childbirth, and refer the mother and newborn when complications arise. 
By exploring skilled birth attendants’ views, experiences, and behaviour, this synthesis aimed to identify factors that can influence their ability to provide quality care.
