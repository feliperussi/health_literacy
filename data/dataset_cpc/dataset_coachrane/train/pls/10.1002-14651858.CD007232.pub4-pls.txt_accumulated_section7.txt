Interventions for improving the ability to rise to stand from sitting following stroke
Question 
We wanted to assess the effectiveness of training, exercises or other interventions aimed at helping people who have had a stroke stand up independently from a sitting position, compared with usual care or no intervention. 
Background 
Rising to stand from sitting is one of the most frequently performed tasks of daily living and is something people need to be able to do to start walking. After a stroke, people may have difficulty rising to stand from sitting. This review looked at the effect of training or exercises on ability to rise to stand, and also aimed to look at the effect of different chair positions that might help people rise to stand. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 13 studies up to June 2013. These studies included 603 participants who had had a stroke. Twelve of the studies investigated the effect of different types of training or exercise: six studies (276 participants) investigated repetitive sit‐to‐stand training, four studies (264 participants) investigated an exercise training programme that included sit‐to‐stand training, one study (12 participants) included a training programme (sitting training) aiming to improve sit‐to‐stand, and one study (42 participants) investigated feedback (information about the symmetry of weight taken through the feet) during sit‐to‐stand. One of the studies investigated the effect of starting posture for sit‐to‐stand: this study (nine participants) compared sit‐to‐stand with a cane and without a cane. This study measured people during three tests of rising to stand with a cane, and three tests of rising to stand without a cane; there was no training period.
