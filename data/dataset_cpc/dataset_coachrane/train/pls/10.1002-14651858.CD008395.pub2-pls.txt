Nebulised deoxyribonuclease for viral bronchiolitis in children younger than 24 months
Bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory illness leading to hospitalisations in infants. Viral infections, particularly respiratory syncytial virus, are the usual cause, which lead to blockage of the small airways of the lungs due to inflammation and increased mucus production. Afflicted children have fever, cough, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Treatment is usually supportive. In bronchiolitis, the mucus produced contains large amounts of DNA, which makes it thicker and stickier. Removal of this DNA facilitates clearance of the mucus.Â RhDNase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA and hence may improve symptoms. We performed this review to assess the effect of rhDNase delivered through a nebuliser in children under 24 months old hospitalised for bronchiolitis. 
We identified three randomised controlled trials involving 333 children up to 24 months of age hospitalised with bronchiolitis. All three studies compared nebulised rhDNase with placebo. Any additional treatments were given to both groups. Overall, the studies did not show that nebulised rhDNase shortened the duration of hospital admission, or improved the severity of symptoms. No serious side effects were reported by any of the studies. 
One study showed that in patients suffering from atelectasis, a severe complication of bronchiolitis wherein the lung does not expand completely, nebulised rhDNase treatment resulted in a distinct improvement within two days. To confirm this beneficial effect, further clinical studies in patients with severe bronchiolitis are needed. Currently, the use of this treatment in young children hospitalised with bronchiolitis is not recommended.
