How can communication about the end of life and care in the last 12 months of life be improved? 
Key messages 
We did not find enough good quality evidence to be able to say which ways of communicating about end of life (EoL) are best for the people involved. One study of a family conference intervention found that communication interventions might increase the length of EoL discussions between families and health professionals in some situations, and one other found that an intervention which used a structured conversation guide might lead to earlier discussions between patients, carers, and health professionals about EoL and EoL care. We did not find any evidence of harmful or negative effects of communication interventions, and we are uncertain about effects on outcomes like knowledge or quality of EoL care. 
Why is communication at the end of life important? 
When people are in the last year of their life, it is important that they receive high‐quality care (refer to ACSQHC 2015 and 2015b references for more on care at end of life). Communication about EoL is a critical part of such care. It helps patients and their families and carers to understand what is happening, to know what to expect and what their options are, to ask questions and receive support, and to be involved in decisions and planning as much as they would like to be. Communication about EoL is not always done well and this can have negative effects. Understanding how to improve such communication between the different people involved in care at EoL (patients, family members, carers, health professionals) is important to help ensure that people receive the best possible care in the time leading up to death. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out which ways of communicating with patients and carers might be best for improving people’s knowledge about the EoL (e.g. what to expect, treatment options).
