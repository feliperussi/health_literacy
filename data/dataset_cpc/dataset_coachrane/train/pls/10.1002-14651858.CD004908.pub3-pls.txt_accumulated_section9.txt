Relief of pain caused by uterine cramping or involution after giving birth
This updated review investigates the effectiveness and safety of drug and non‐drug pain relief in women experiencing after‐birth pains following vaginal birth. Giving an agent for pain relief was compared to an inactive placebo, to no treatment, or to a different type of agent in randomised controlled trials. 
What is the issue? 
Women may experience cramping pain and discomfort following the birth of their baby, as the uterus contracts and returns to its normal pre‐pregnancy size. These pains usually last for two to three days after the birth. Women who have previously had a baby are more likely to experience after‐birth pains. Breastfeeding stimulates the uterus to contract and increases the severity of the pains. 
Types of pain relief used to treat the pain include paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and naproxen, opioids including codeine, and non‐medicine methods such as herbal preparations and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). 
Why is this important? 
Management of pain after birth is important, as the pain can affect a mother carrying out her normal activities as well as bonding with and caring for her baby. After‐pains can interfere with establishing breastfeeding. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (October 2019) and identified 28 studies (2749 mothers) who were in hospital after uncomplicated single births. Most of the evidence is low‐certainty because the studies did not include sufficient numbers of women. Many of the studies excluded breastfeeding women.This makes the evidence less relevant to a broader group of women. No studies reported evidence on adverse events in the newborn infants.
