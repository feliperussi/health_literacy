Home‐based versus supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation
Review question 
We compared home‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes with supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with myocardial infarction (blood flow to the heart has stopped), angina (chest pain), heart failure or who had undergone revascularisation. 
Background 
Cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore people with heart disease to health, through a combination of exercise, education and psychological support. Traditionally, centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (e.g. based at a hospital, gymnasium or in sport centre) are offered to people after cardiac events. Home‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes have been introduced to increase access and participation.

Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (trials that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups) looking at the effectiveness of home‐based versus supervised centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, in adults with heart disease. 
We included 23 trials (2890 participants). Most trials were relatively small (median 104 participants, range: 20 to 525). The average age of trial participants ranged from 51.6 to 69 years. Women accounted for only 19% of recruited participants; four trials did not include women. 
The mix of people recruited to the trials varied; 10 studies included a mixed population of people with coronary heart disease, five studies included people who had had a heart attack, and four studies each recruited people following revascularisation or who had heart failure. 
Study funding sources 
Sixteen studies reported sources of funding; seven did not. No study reported funding from an agency with commercial interest in the results.
