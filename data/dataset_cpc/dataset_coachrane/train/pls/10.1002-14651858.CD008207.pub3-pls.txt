Continuous passive motion therapy for preventing venous thromboembolism after total knee replacement (arthroplasty) 
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common form of orthopaedic surgery that can improve the quality of life for patients. Patients who receive joint replacement are particularly susceptible to developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) because of tissue damage, surgical stress, immobility and muscle weakness following the surgery. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) describes both DVT and PE, which is potentially fatal. The risk of DVT is greatest in the first week after surgery. Drug treatments to prevent VTE include low‐molecular‐weight heparin, fondaparinux or warfarin, which reduce blood clotting (coagulation). These drugs increase the risk of bleeding after TKA and associated complications such as infection and wound healing problems. Early mobilisation and mechanical methods are therefore of clinical interest. Continuous passive motion (CPM) uses an external motorised device to move the patient's knee through a preset range of motion, as part of postoperative management. 
We included 11 trials involving 808 participants in our review. The methodological quality of the included studies was variable and the quality of the evidence was low because the outcomes of interest were only reported by one or two studies. Sensitive methods such as venography or sonography were not always used to diagnose DVT and the CPM was applied differently across studies, varying in range of motion, duration of CPM per day and the number of days after the surgery. The incidence of DVT or VTE was not clearly different in the CPM group compared with the control group of participants. This review did not find enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to conclude that CPM reduces VTE.
