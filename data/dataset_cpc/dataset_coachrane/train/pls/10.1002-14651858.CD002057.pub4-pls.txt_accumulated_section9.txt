Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants 
Review question 
To compare the effectiveness of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator‐dependent preterm neonates with birth weight ≤ 1500 g or gestational age ≤ 32 weeks after 7 days of life on the incidence of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' corrected postmenstrual age. 
Background 
Preterm babies (babies born before term, 40 weeks pregnancy) often need breathing (ventilator) support. Babies who need invasive (placing a breathing tube in the wind pipe) mechanical breathing support for a prolonged period often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as requirement for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age). It is thought that inflammation in the lungs may be part of the cause. Corticosteroid drugs reduce inflammation and swelling in the lungs, but can have serious side effects. Corticosteroid use has been associated with cerebral palsy (motor problem) and developmental delay. Inhaling steroids, so that the drug reaches the lungs directly, has been tried as a way to limit adverse effects.

Study characteristics 
All three included trials were randomised, but the blinding of intervention and outcome measurement varied. Data from two trials (enrolling 139 infants) were combined as they enrolled infants between 12 and 21 days of age, but data from one trial (enrolling 292 infants) were reported separately because researchers randomised infants aged less than 72 hours. The timing when the outcomes were measured varied among studies so it was not appropriate to combine some results. In one study all deaths that occurred were reported from the time babies were randomised not from when treatment started, hence there was a greater number of babies who died in that study.
