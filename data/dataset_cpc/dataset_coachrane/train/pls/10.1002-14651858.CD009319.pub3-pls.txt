Surgical sampling or removal of low‐grade glioma brain tumors
The issue: Low‐grade gliomas (LGGs) are slow growing, less aggressive brain tumors. The most optimal surgical management is under debate. 
The aim of the review: There are two surgical management strategies (treatments) for a person with a suspected LGG. These are biopsy, the surgical sampling of a small amount of tumor tissue, or resection, where as much as possible of the tumor is surgically removed. Tissues from both operations are then histologically examined to give a definitive diagnosis of the type and grade (severity) of the tumor. The aim of the review is to determine if biopsy or resection is the best treatment strategy. 
The main findings: There is much debate about which of these surgical techniques is the best for patient survival. We searched the literature up to June 2016. However, currently there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which have looked at which is the better procedure, only retrospective research studies looking at how people have responded to procedures that have happened in the past. Therefore, in the future, more RCTs are needed to try and answer this question. 
Quality of the evidence: We were unable to determine this as no studies were included and only low‐quality evidence from non‐RCTs is available. 
Conclusions: There are no randomized clinical trials on this topic; some institutional, non‐clinical trials studies have suggested improved overall survival and seizure control with higher extent of resection. However, physicians should approach each case individually and weigh the risks and benefits of biopsy versus surgical resection, as well as incorporate patient preference into their clinical decision‐making. Prognostic factors such as patient age, tumor size, and tumor location as well as potential implications for quality of life should be taken into account.
