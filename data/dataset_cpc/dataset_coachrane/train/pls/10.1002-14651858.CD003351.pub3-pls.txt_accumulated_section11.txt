Adding ketamine to opioid for opioid‐resistant cancer pain
Bottom line 
The benefits and harms of adding low‐dose ketamine to strong pain‐killers such as morphine for the relief of cancer pain are not yet established. High‐dose ketamine does not appear to be effective and may be associated with serious side effects. 
Background 
This review is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2012.
Morphine‐like drugs (opioids) are frequently prescribed for moderate and severe cancer pain, but in some cases these drugs are not effective. Ketamine, an anaesthetic agent, is used in low doses in palliative care to improve analgesia when opioids alone are ineffective. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2016 and January 2017, we searched for clinical trials on the addition of ketamine to morphine‐like drugs for cancer pain. 
We found one new study, together with the two studies included in the original review. The three studies were very different, using different doses of ketamine, different routes of administration and different durations of treatment and it was not possible to combine the results of these studies. 
Key results 
The two smallest studies reported that the addition of ketamine to morphine reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements. The third study which used high doses of ketamine reported no clinical benefit of adding ketamine to different opioids. Increased doses of ketamine in some participants caused side effects such as hallucinations. The study which examined high doses of ketamine reported two serious adverse events, which may have been related to ketamine. Although two out of three studies reported reduction in pain, this could be due to chance in such small studies.
