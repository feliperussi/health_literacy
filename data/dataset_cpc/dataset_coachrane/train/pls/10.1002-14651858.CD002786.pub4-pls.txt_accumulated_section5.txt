Medicines to prevent blockage of vascular access following surgery for formation of arteriovenous fistula or graft 
Background 
People with advanced kidney disease (called end‐stage renal disease) need dialysis to perform kidney functions. In haemodialysis, blood is filtered through a machine. To allow a large enough passage for blood to flow between the person and the machine, an artery and a vein can be surgically joined (to form an arteriovenous fistula) or a prosthetic arteriovenous graft (a substitute for a vein) is used to join the artery to the vein. These access points might last for years but can become blocked or infected. This review investigated if additional medical therapy can keep these dialysis access points patent (i.e. open or unblocked). 
Study characteristics and key results 
The review authors identified 13 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups; evidence current to August 2020) with 2080 participants. The trials compared antithrombotic medicines (which prevent abnormal clotting in the blood vessels; such as ticlopidine, aspirin, dipyridamole and clopidogrel) and other types of medicine used to prevent blockages in the artery and vein access points for dialysis compared to placebo (dummy treatment). The trials included people with advanced kidney disease receiving dialysis through all types of arteriovenous fistulae or arteriovenous grafts in the arms or legs, or at special sites. We excluded people receiving dialysis via the tummy (called peritoneal dialysis), or studies that compared medical therapy with no treatment. Where possible, we grouped similar studies.
