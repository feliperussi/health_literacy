Maintenance therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), comprising about 10% of AML cases. APL has a distinct therapeutic approach and is the most curable type of AML. It is characterized by a specific chromosome translocation, the t(15;17). The integrated effect of induction and consolidation in APL currently results in high long‐term survival rates, reaching as high as 90% in some series. Contrary to the established role of initial treatment phases (termed induction and consolidation phases), in APL there is conflicting evidence regarding the place of a continued low‐toxicity treatment (termed maintenance treatment) in these patients. This debate has become more intense after the introduction of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which targets the PML‐RARα fusion gene, and even more so with the recent addition of arsenic trioxide to the therapeutic options of APL. 
We aimed to evaluate the effects of maintenance therapy on survival in APL patients as well as to assess its influence on other parameters, such as disease recurrence rate and adverse events. We also tried to establish the best maintenance regimen for these patients. 
We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials including 2072 patients. Our main results showed that any maintenance treatment compared to observation prolongs the freedom from disease duration but not overall survival. Similarly, ATRA and chemotherapy compared to ATRA alone improves freedom from disease duration but not overall survival. Moreover, ATRA‐based regimens compared to non‐ATRA based regimens probably improves freedom from disease duration but not overall survival.
