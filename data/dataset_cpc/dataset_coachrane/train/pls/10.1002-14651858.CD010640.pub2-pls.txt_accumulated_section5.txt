Iron treatment in adults without kidney disease
Background 
Anaemia is common, affecting about a quarter of the world's population. Anaemia can be defined as a reduction in the number of circulating red cells or in the quantity of haemoglobin (both of which carry oxygen) in the blood. An estimated 50% of anaemic people have anaemia due to iron deficiency. We wanted to assess the safety and usefulness of iron treatment in adult men and adult women who were not pregnant and had not just given birth to a child, and who did not have kidney disease. To achieve this aim, we searched the medical literature in July 2013 for relevant studies. We included only randomised trialsâ€”a type of study in which the treatment received by participants is determined by chance, so that similar types of people are given the different treatments to be studied. This allows evaluation of the effects of treatment on these people rather than examination of preexisting differences among people receiving different treatments. We included all trials irrespective of the year or language in which they were published. Two review authors independently selected the studies and recorded information from these studies to minimise error. 
Study characteristics 
We included 4745 participants from 21 trials who received iron injections, iron tablets or no treatment. Clinical settings of these trials included loss of blood, cancer, anaemia before surgery for various reasons and heart failure, among others. Most trials included participants with mild to moderate anaemia and excluded participants who were allergic to iron therapy.
