Intrauterine insemination versus intracervical insemination in donor sperm treatment
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine insemination (IUI) compared to intracervical insemination (ICI) in women who started donor sperm treatment. 
Background 
The first‐line treatment in donor sperm treatment consists of inseminations that can be done by placing sperm inside a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilisation (IUI) or by inserting sperm into the vagina using a small, needleless syringe or a cervical cap (ICI). Both IUI and ICI can be performed in natural cycles or following ovarian stimulation. 
Ovarian stimulation can be performed with gonadotrophins, which are injected, or clomiphene citrate, which is available as a tablet. One of the risks of ovarian stimulation is multiple pregnancies. Therefore, the first few cycles of IUI and ICI are usually performed without ovarian stimulation. 
It is important that IUI and ICI are performed at a specific time in the woman's menstrual cycle (as close to ovulation as possible). Various techniques of determining the best timing for IUI and ICI in natural cycles are available, such as keeping basal temperature charts, checking cervical mucus scores, testing blood or urine levels of luteinising hormone (LH), or monitoring with ultrasounds. 
We compared IUI and ICI with each other, and also compared different types of each technique. 
Study characteristics 
We found six randomised controlled trials, including 708 women. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in natural cycles. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles. Two studies compared the timing of IUI and ICI. The evidence is current to December 2017.
