Simulated presence therapy for dementia
Review question 
Can simulated presence therapy (SPT) treat problem behaviours, and improve quality of life for people with dementia? 
Background 
Dementia is an illness, most common among older people, in which memory and other brain functions deteriorate and people gradually become dependent on others for care. Many people with dementia, particularly in its later stages, show signs of distress at times, or behave in ways which are difficult for their caregivers to manage. There is a lot of interest in finding ways to treat this without using drugs. Simulated presence therapy is a type of treatment which has been used mainly in nursing homes. It involves playing a personalised video or audiotape recording of family members to the person with dementia when he or she is distressed or agitated. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for trials which compared SPT to usual care or to another treatment. Ideally, people with dementia should have been randomly allocated to one or other treatment, but we also included trials even if treatment allocation was not strictly random. 
We found three trials which met our inclusion criteria. The 144 participants were all living in nursing homes. The majority were women with an average age of over 80 years and severe dementia. The way SPT was administered was different in each trial. All the trials used more than one comparison treatment, which differed between trials. The trials all attempted to measure an effect on agitated behaviours, but used different approaches. 
Key findings 
Because the trials were so different from each other, we were not able to pool the results. Individually, each trial reported different methods to assess the effect of SPT on behavioural problems and the results varied depending on the method used to measure the outcome.
