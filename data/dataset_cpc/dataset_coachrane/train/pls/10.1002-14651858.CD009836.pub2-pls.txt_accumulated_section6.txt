Management of minor cytological abnormalities identified on cervical screening
The issueCervical screening programmes reduce the risk of cervical cancer, through the use of cervical cytology (smear tests), which aim to detect and treat any precancerous changes which might put some women at risk of developing invasive disease (invasive cervical cancer) in the future. Usually only severe precancerous changes require treatment, however, there is some discrepancy in how to manage women with minor cytological changes (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/borderline) or low‐grade squamous intra‐epithelial lesions (LSIL/mild dyskaryosis) if HPV (human papillomavirus) testing is not routinely available. 
The aim of the reviewWe aimed to assess whether immediate colposcopy or 'watchful waiting', with repeat cervical cytology, was better for women with minor cervical cytological abnormalities. 
What are the main findings?We included 5 randomised controlled trials including 11,466 participants with minor abnormalities on cervical cytology, treated either with immediate colposcopy or repetitive cytology. The included studies assessed differences in occurrence of cervical precancerous lesions between the two treatments. 
The results suggested that women attending immediate colposcopy after a single low‐grade abnormal cervical cytology test were more likely to have clinically insignificant findings detected than women who were managed with 'watchful waiting'. 
There were 18 cases of invasive cervical cancer, seven in the immediate colposcopy and 11 in the cytological surveillance groups. The detection rate of clinically insignificant low‐grade lesions was higher in the immediate colposcopy group, as was the detection rate of clinically more significant high‐grade precancerous lesions (CIN2 or CIN2 or worse) at 18 months, but not by 24 months.
