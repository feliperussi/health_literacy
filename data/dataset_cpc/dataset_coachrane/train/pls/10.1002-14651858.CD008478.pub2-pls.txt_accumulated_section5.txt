Fertility and early pregnancy outcomes after treatment for cervical pre‐cancer (cervical intra‐epithelial neoplasia) 
The issue  Preterm birth risk is higher after local treatment for precancer of the neck of the womb (cervix), yet there are only a few research studies that have investigated the effect on fertility and early pregnancy outcomes following treatment. 
The aim of the review  We aimed to assess whether treatment for this cancer ‐ cervical intra‐epithelial neoplasia (CIN) ‐ adversely affects the chances of a successful conception and pregnancy outcomes in the first and second trimesters (less than 24 weeks of gestation). 
What are the main findings?  We included all studies that assessed fertility and early pregnancy outcomes in women who had local treatment of CIN versus untreated women. We identified fifteen suitable studies.  Fertility outcomes  The results suggest that local treatment of the cervix does not adversely affect the ability to conceive; in fact the overall pregnancy rate was higher for treated women when compared to untreated women (43% versus 38%). There was no difference in the pregnancy rates in women that intended to conceive (88% treated versus 95% untreated) or in the number of women requiring more than 12 months to conceive (15% treated versus 9% untreated). 
Early pregnancy outcomes  The rates of total (less than 24 weeks of gestation) and first trimester (less than 12 weeks of gestation) miscarriage were no different. However, women after treatment had a significantly higher second trimester miscarriage rate (between 12 and 24 weeks of gestation) compared to untreated controls (1.6% versus 0.4%). The rates of ectopic pregnancies and terminations of pregnancy were higher for treated versus untreated women.
