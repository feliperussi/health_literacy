Do invitations, lay health worker interventions and educational interventions increase the uptake of cervical screening? 
The issueCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. At present, women are asked to attend cervical screening (also known as a 'smear' or 'Pap test') to detect the presence of high‐risk HPV and/or abnormal or pre‐cancerous cells. The uptake of cervical screening is low globally. The UK's Cervical Screening Programme has shown that screening can reduce mortality through early detection and treatment of pre‐cancerous changes before cancer develops. However, there is variation between and within countries in the availability and uptake of screening. There are also differences based on ethnic groups, age, education and socioeconomic status and this needs to be borne in mind when developing interventions to increase uptake. 
The aim of the reviewThe aim of this review was to look at the methods used to encourage women to undergo cervical screening. These included invitations, reminders, education, message framing, counselling, risk factor assessment, procedures and economic interventions. 
What are the main findings?Seventy trials were included in this review, of which 69 trials (257,899 women) were entered into a meta‐analysis. Invitations, and to a lesser extent, educational materials probably increase the uptake of cervical screening (moderate‐certainty evidence). HPV self‐testing, as an alternative to Pap smears, may also increase screening coverage. However, self‐testing was not covered in this review and will be considered in a subsequent review. Lay health workers used to promote screening to ethnic minority groups may increase screening uptake (low‐certainty evidence).
