Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterised by progressive inflammation and scarring of liver bile ducts. Destruction of bile ducts leads to incidence of bile flow to the gut, resulting in the development of biliary cirrhosis and end‐stage liver disease. PSC is most common in young males and its aetiology is still not fully understood. The disease is usually classified as an autoimmune disorder, but other aetiological factors cannot be excluded. There is a strong association of PSC with inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis, which coexists in approximately 70% of patients. Besides its progressive and irreversible nature, PSC is also associated with an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma, which contributes to an even higher morbidity and mortality of this disease. 
The diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis is based on a combined approach that includes clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. Since the disease is usually asymptomatic in its initial stage, early recognition and diagnosis is actually rather rare. Because of poor understanding of aetiology and pathogenesis, treatment of PSC is still not satisfactory. Numerous medications have been evaluated for therapy of PSC, but most of them showed none or minimal effect, and certain drugs were associated with serious adverse events. Bile acids have also been considered for the treatment of PSC demonstrating a possible beneficial effect. However, further investigation of their role in PSC therapy is needed. Therefore, the treatment of choice for patients with end‐stage liver disease due to PSC remains liver transplantation. Despite the relatively low incidence of PSC in the general population, PSC remains among the most common indications for liver transplantation in Europe and the United States.
