Vaginal dilator therapy for women receiving pelvic radiotherapy
Background 
Pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological (uterine, cervical, vaginal) and anorectal cancer may damage the vagina. It may cause the vagina to shrink and can make the sides stick together. It has become established practice to recommend regular vaginal dilation after radiotherapy to reduce or prevent this risk. Dilation involves inserting and rotating a phallus‐shaped appliance in the vagina approximately three times a week for about five minutes to stretch the skin. 
Review question 
This updated review re‐appraised all the literature and retrieved all available data on this topic to see if there was any evidence to support vaginal dilation after pelvic radiotherapy. 
Main or key findings 
Women who want to preserve the length of their vagina after radiotherapy should consider dilation. There are limited data from observational studies that suggest regular stretching of the vagina, once radiotherapy treatment is completed, might reduce the risk of scaring by a small amount. There is no evidence to support dilation therapy during radiotherapy. There are also case reports and one case series suggesting that dilation months or years after radiotherapy might help restore vaginal length. 
Quality of the evidence 
Randomised trial design has not, and may never, obtain high‐quality evidence to assess vaginal dilation therapy. The available studies suggest, but cannot prove, that dilation works. However, this only applies once the radiotherapy has finished. There is an association between vaginal dilation after radiotherapy and less vaginal stenosis, but this is not proof that the benefit is due to dilation. The link between dilation and less stenosis could either be due to a beneficial effect of dilation or because women with stenosis (or who self report stenosis) are less able to use the dilator.
