Interventions for increasing solid organ donor registration
What is the issue? 
There is a global need to increase the number of available organs for transplantation. One possible strategy is to encourage more individuals to register as organ donors. 
What did we do? 
To address this, we identified 46 studies that tested various strategies to encourage people to register as an organ donor. Sixteen of these studies measured actual registration, 27 studies measured people’s intention to register/donate and three studies measured both. 
What did we find? 
Studies were conducted in widely different settings including schools, driver motor vehicle (DMV) centres, primary care and in the local community. Studies also used widely different strategies to increase registration such as education, training peer‐leaders, training DMV or primary care staff, and framing information about organ donation in certain ways. 
We found that studies had a small overall effect on people’s intention to register/donate along with actual registration rates, however, no particular strategy stood out as being more effective than the rest. There was encouraging evidence that training peer‐leaders in the community to deliver organ donation education may improve registration rates and classroom‐based education from members of the transplant community may improve intention to register/donate. There was also some evidence that framing organ donation information in certain ways may help increase people’s intention to register/donate but further studies are needed. 
Conclusions 
In summary, strategies to increase organ donation registration have some benefit but vary considerably in terms of the setting in which they are delivered, who they target and how they are delivered.
