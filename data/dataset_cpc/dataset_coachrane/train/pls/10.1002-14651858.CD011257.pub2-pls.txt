Couple and family therapies for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
PTSD is a severe condition that is linked to both individual and relationship problems. Therapies targeting couples and families have been recommended for the treatment of PTSD, but it is not clear if these are helpful in reducing trauma symptoms, and other mental health or relationship problems. The current review is the first attempt to summarise the findings from studies on couple and family therapies for adults with PTSD. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
People who suffer from trauma, as well as their families; researchers; and mental health professionals. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
Are couple or family therapies helpful in treating PTSD symptoms and other mental health and relationship problems in comparison to ‘no treatment’ or other types of therapy? 
Is there any type of couple and family therapy that is more beneficial than others?
Which studies were included in the review? 
We included all published studies of couple and family therapies for PTSD. We found four studies of relevant therapies for adults where one adult person in the couple/family was diagnosed with PTSD. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There were few relevant studies and more research is needed to be sure about the benefits of couple and family therapies for PTSD. The four studies included in this review provided early suggestion that couple‐based treatments may be helpful in reducing trauma symptoms for the person with PTSD. However, the benefits were not as clear for improving relationship quality or the mental health of family members. 
What should happen next? 
More studies, including different types of trauma and different types of couple and family therapies for PTSD, are required.
