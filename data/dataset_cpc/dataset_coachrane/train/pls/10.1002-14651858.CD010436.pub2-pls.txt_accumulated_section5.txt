Steroid‐eluting sinus stents for improving symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery 
Background 
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa. Although the cause of CRS remains unclear, multiple factors are likely to contribute to its development. CRS is treated with medical therapy (topical or oral steroids) and surgery. While medical treatments offer relief for most patients with CRS, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is commonly performed. However, the surgical outcome of FESS can be compromised by postoperative inflammation, polyposis (formation of polyps) and adhesions of the nasal mucous lining, which often require subsequent interventions. Postoperative treatments are therefore required to achieve optimal long‐term results. Steroid‐eluting sinus stents are devices that are inserted into the nose, sinuses or both, and gradually release a steroid after FESS. They are used to prevent stenosis (narrowing) of the sinus openings and provide anti‐inflammatory benefits during the postoperative healing period. However, it is unknown whether steroid‐eluting sinus stents offer any beneficial effect in improving nasal symptoms of patients with CRS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the effects of steroid‐eluting sinus stents compared to non‐steroid‐eluting sinus stents, nasal packing or no treatment in adult patients with CRS who underwent FESS. From the 159 records we retrieved using our search strategy, we identified 21 trials that could potentially be included as they used sinus stents for patients undergoing FESS. However, we had to exclude these trials from the review because they met some but not all of the inclusion criteria. We therefore identified no trials that could be included in the review.
