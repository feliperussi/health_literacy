Oral immunotherapy for the treatment of peanut allergy
Allergy to peanut can result in potentially life‐threatening reactions and, on occasions, death. Unlike many other forms of food allergy, allergy to peanut is typically life‐long. There is currently no cure for peanut allergy and people with this allergy must constantly be careful to avoid accidentally eating peanut or peanut‐containing foods.  If a person with a peanut allergy accidentally ingests peanut, he or she may develop serious allergic reactions necessitating emergency treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). 
The overall goal of allergen‐specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the risk of further reactions associated with exposure to peanuts. Most people who have reactions to peanut have an immediate type (also sometimes known as IgE‐mediated) reaction in which symptoms typically develop within minutes of exposure to peanut protein and it is for this group that allergen‐specific OIT is a potential treatment approach.  It is not considered suitable for those who experience more delayed (also sometimes known as non‐IgE mediated) reactions.  Treatment involves giving people with peanut allergy very small doses of peanut protein by mouth and gradually increasing the amount being administered (the build‐up phase). Once the desired dose has been achieved, this is followed by the patient taking the same dose of peanut every day for a set period of time (maintenance phase).  As giving doses of peanut to someone with a peanut allergy has the potential to introduce allergic reactions, participants' safety needs to be carefully monitored during studies of peanut OIT.
