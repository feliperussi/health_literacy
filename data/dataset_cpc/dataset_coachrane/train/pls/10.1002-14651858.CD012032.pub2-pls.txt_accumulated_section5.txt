Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers
Review question 
We aimed to review the evidence as to whether reconstructive surgery is an effective treatment for healing pressure ulcers. We were unable to find any randomised controlled trials investigating this question. 
Background 
Pressure ulcers are areas of skin and tissue damage that result largely from people remaining in the same position for long periods of time. When parts of the body, especially those that have less fat such as the lower back and heel, have constant external pressure applied (for example sitting on the same area of the body without changing position) this restricts blood flow to the skin and underlying tissues which can lead them to break down. People at risk of developing pressure ulcers include the elderly and those with mobility problems such as wheelchair users and long‚Äêterm hospital patients. Pressure ulcers can be classified using a staging system where stage I ulcers still have intact skin, stage II ulcers involve partial skin and tissue loss and are often shallow wounds and stage III and IV ulcers are open wounds with deeper tissue damage. Pressure ulcers are serious wounds that are costly to treat, so care is focused on their prevention. When ulcers do occur, treatment options include wound dressings, and antibiotics and antiseptics. Reconstructive surgery is often reserved for deep or hard to heal pressure ulcers, or both. There are different types of surgeries that can be conducted: most involve removal of dead tissue from the wound and then use of fat, muscle and/or skin from other parts of the patient's body to fill the wound cavity.
