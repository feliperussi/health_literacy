Placebo response and remission rates in randomised trials of induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a recurrent, chronic inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the large intestine (colon). Symptoms include abdominal pain, urgency to pass stools, bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue. When symptoms stop patients are considered to be in remission. Clinical trials for UC are usually designed to assess whether a drug treatment brings about a clinical response (an improvement of disease symptoms) or remission (typically measured within eight weeks of treatment) or helps to maintain a clinical response or remission over a longer period of time (typically measured after one year of treatment). 
What is the placebo effect? 
The placebo effect occurs when a patient experiences an actual or perceived improvement in health after receiving a dummy (non‚Äêactive) treatment. The factors influencing this are not completely understood but may be due to the psychological effect of receiving treatment, rather than the treatment itself. Understanding the size of the placebo effect and the factors that influence it is important, because the placebo response rate is used to calculate the number of patients needed when designing a clinical trial of new drug treatment. Ideally when designing a clinical trial researchers aim to minimize the size of the placebo effect to best detect the true difference between the active drug and dummy treatment with the minimum number of patients. This means that clinical trials, which are costly to conduct, could be designed with fewer numbers of patients, greater efficiency, lower cost and ultimately bring new drugs to patients more quickly.
