Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipationÂ without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria.
