Virtual reality needs to be explored to show its effects for treatment of schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia often have problems in their processes of thinking and understanding, resulting in poor insight into their illness and poor organisational skills. These factors along with experiencing unpleasant side effects of medication can contribute to people with mental health problems often not taking their medication, unwilling to follow treatment and non‐attendance at appointments. This can sometimes lead to a loss of contact with the mental health team and relapse. Virtual reality (VR) is a modern, experimental, computerised and real‐time technology that uses visual graphics, sounds and other sensory input which creates an interactive computer world. It includes, for example, the use of sensors attached to the hands and fingers allowing virtual reality users to track their position and movement. Virtual reality creates a computerised environment that simulates real life and everyday activities.This could help people learn in a safe and friendly environment to improve their decisions and attitudes about treatment, so encouraging people to take or comply with their medication.   
So far, virtual reality has been used in the assessment and treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders and social anxieties, some of which include, fear of flying, public speaking anxiety, spider phobia, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. There are also a few studies that examine the emotional responses of people with schizophrenia during a computer simulation with characters displaying happy, neutral, and angry emotions. Virtual reality has also been used for people with schizophrenia in social skills training and to improve processes of thinking and understanding. This review investigates the effects of virtual reality in helping support the treatment and taking of medication for people with serious mental illness.
