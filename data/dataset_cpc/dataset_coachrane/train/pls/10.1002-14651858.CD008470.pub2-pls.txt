Surgical versus conservative treatment for ankle fractures in adults
Each year, one in every 800 people break (fracture) their ankles. Such injuries typically happen to young men and older women. Ankle fractures can be treated surgically or conservatively (non‐surgically). Surgery involves an operation to expose the fracture to reposition the broken parts of the bone and then fix them in place using wires, pins, screws and other devices. Treatment after surgery varies but may also include the use of a plaster cast. Conservative treatment involves repositioning of the fractured bone by manipulating it through the skin, followed by immobilisation of the ankle in a plaster cast for several weeks. This review aimed to find out whether surgery or conservative treatment gives a better long‐term outcome for people with these injuries. 
This review included four trials, involving a total of 292 participants. All four trials had flawed methods that could affect the reliability of their findings. No data could be pooled for long‐term measures of function or pain. The largest trial found no evidence of differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient‐reported symptoms or walking difficulties at seven years follow‐up. The second trial found better results for the surgical group for function but not pain at 27 months, while the third trial reported no difference between the two groups in clinical outcome at 3.5 years. In all four trials, there were some patients in the conservative treatment group who were treated surgically because the repositioning of the fractured bone was judged unsuccessful. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications nor in radiological signs of osteoarthritis. 
Overall, there was not enough reliable evidence to draw conclusions about whether surgery or conservative treatment is more appropriate for treating broken ankles in adults.
