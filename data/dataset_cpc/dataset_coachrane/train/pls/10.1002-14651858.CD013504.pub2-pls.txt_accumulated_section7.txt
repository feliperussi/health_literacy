The continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants for people with arrhythmia and undergoing catheter ablation 
Review question 
Should doctors continue or stop blood thinner medicine before catheter ablation procedures in people with arrhythmia? 
Background 
Irregular heartbeats (also known as arrhythmia) come in different types; the most common type of which is uncoordinated irregular beats (also known as atrial fibrillation). People with irregular heartbeats are at risk of stroke and hence they require long‐term use of blood thinner medicines to prevent blood clots. Many of these patients may need to undergo a procedure called 'ablation' where doctors use surgery or a catheter (a thin flexible tube) to restore the normal rhythm of the heart. Before this procedure, the doctor may decide to continue the blood thinner or stop it temporarily. Such a decision should consider two things. First, the risk of a blood clot developing at the time of the ablation if the blood thinner is stopped. Second, the risk of bleeding during the procedure if the blood thinner is continued. There is no clear evidence that one decision is better than the other in terms of safety. Due to this uncertainty, we undertook this review to investigate the benefit and harms of continuing versus stopping the blood thinner at the time of the ablation procedure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases and identified 12 clinical trials involving 4714 participants aged 18 years and older with atrial fibrillation. The participants were randomly (like a flip of a coin) put into one of two or more groups. The groups were: continuing the blood thinner at the time of the procedure or stopping the blood thinner either for several days or by one or two doses before the procedure with or without giving additional heparin.
