Treatments for acute bleeds in people with acquired hemophilia A
Acquired hemophilia A is a rare but severe bleeding disorder caused by the autoantibody directed against factor VIII (FVIII, a blood clotting protein) in patients with no previous history of a bleeding disorder. This bleeding disorder occurs more frequently in the elderly and may be associated with several other conditions, such as solid tumours, autoimmune diseases, or with drugs; it is also sometimes associated with pregnancy. However, in about half of the cases the causes are unknown. Bleeding occurs in the skin; mucous membranes; and muscles; with joint bleeds being unusual. Therapies for acquired hemophilia A include treatments to stop acute bleeds and to destroy the FVIII autoantibodies. Acute bleeds can be treated with recombinant activated FVII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC). If these are unavailable, FVIII concentrates or 1‐desamino‐8‐D‐arginine‐vasopressin (DDAVP) fresh frozen plasma can be attempted; however, these last two options are not usually effective, and it is not known if one of these products is better than the other. 
We conducted a review of any treatment used in people with acquired hemophilia A during episodes of acute bleeding. After searching for all relevant trials, no randomised controlled trials could be identified, and no definitive conclusion on the best available treatment could be drawn. 
Prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the precise role of different drugs for acute bleeds in acquired hemophilia A, but the rarity of the condition is hindering their planning and execution. While waiting for better evidence, patients and doctors need to base treatment decisions on the largest and better conducted observational studies, which are referenced in the background of our review.
