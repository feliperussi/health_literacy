Although the addition of the anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to chemotherapy (R‐chemo) has been shown to improve response rates and progression‐free survival in patients with indolent or mantle cell lymphoma, the efficacy of R‐chemo with respect to overall survival is unclear. 
Study design: Meta‐analysis of seven randomised controlled trials involving 1943 patients.  Contribution: Patients treated with R‐chemo had better overall survival, overall response, complete response, and disease control but more leukocytopenia and fever than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. R‐chemo improved overall survival in patients with follicular lymphoma. Implications: Concomitant treatment with rituximab and standard chemotherapy regimens should be considered the standard of care for patients with indolent and mantle cell lymphomas who require therapy and for patients with follicular lymphoma.  Limitations: Heterogeneity among the analysed mantle cell lymphoma trials precluded reliable assessment of efficacy of R‐chemo with respect to overall survival. Variability in treatment regimens among trials precluded determination of which chemotherapy regimen is the best to combine with rituximab or about the optimal number of cycles needed to treat patients with indolent lymphoma.  Future directions: From our view future studies should focus on the following points:  1. Which standard chemotherapy should be used in combination with Rituximab  2. Influence of clinical and biologic prognostic markers after R‐chemotherapy. What is similar and what is different  3. Understanding rituximab efficacy and resistance  4. Role of rituximab in treatment of progressive disease  5. Mechanism of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy  6. Role of Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetics in the treatment with R‐chemo  7. Role of subsequent therapy with rituximab after R‐chemo
