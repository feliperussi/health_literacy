Informing consumers about how well birth control works
To make a good choice for family planning, people have to know how well different methods work. The pros and cons of the methods are important. People may choose birth control based on how well the method prevents pregnancy. Consumers also need to know what affects the usefulness of the birth control method. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials of ways to inform people about how well family planning methods prevent pregnancy. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. The new program could be compared to the usual practice or to another program or means of informing people. 
We found seven trials with a total of 4526 women. Two had several sessions for participants. One of those looked at the choice of birth control method. Women in the test program more often chose to be sterilized or to use modern birth control than women with the usual counseling. In the other study, the groups had different sessions on family planning. Both groups increased their birth control use. However, the groups were similar at six months in using methods that work well to prevent pregnancy. Five trials had a single session for each group. In one, women learned more from a slide‐and‐sound format than from having a doctor talk to them. Another trial found that effectiveness categories were better than pregnancy numbers for comparing the methods. Still another study provided structured counseling using a flipchart on family planning methods. The groups were similar in choice of birth control and in numbers who still used their chosen method at three months. The last study used videos to inform couples about family planning. The groups were mostly similar in birth control use after the videos. But those who watched videos on motivation and on family planning did not choose pills or an injectable method as often as those who watched only the family planning video.
