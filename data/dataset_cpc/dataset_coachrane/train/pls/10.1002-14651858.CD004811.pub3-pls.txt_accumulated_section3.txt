Family‐centred care for hospitalised children aged 0‐12 years ‐ an update
This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review of family‐centred care published in 2007 (Shields 2007). For this update, we have changed the title to show that it is about children aged 0 to 12 years only. We have now excluded premature neonates, and we have changed several other selection criteria: study designs are now limited to randomised controlled trials only; the way in which family‐centredness of interventions is assessed for inclusion has changed; single interventions not reflecting a FCC model of care have been excluded; and the selection criterion whereby studies with less than adequate blinding of outcome assessment were excluded from the review has been removed. 
When a child comes into hospital, the whole family is affected. In giving care, nurses, doctors and those caring for the child must consider the impact of the child's admission on all family members. 'Family‐centred care' is one way of caring for children in hospital. It is "a way of caring for children and their families within health services which ensures that care is planned around the whole family, not just the individual child/person, and in which all the family members are recognised as care recipients" (Shields 2006, p. 1318). However, with changes in family structures, for example, development of the single parent family, questions arise about how care is best delivered. To ensure that children are cared for in ways that minimise emotional trauma and assist in recovery, it is important that such ways of delivering care are measured to see if they are effective.
