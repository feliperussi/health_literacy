Autologous chondrocyte implantation for full thickness articular cartilage defects of the knee 
A layer of cartilage covering the knee joint surfaces acts to protect the joint and reduce friction. Damage to the cartilage (articular surface) can decrease mobility of the joint and cause pain on movement. Continuing deterioration of the surface may lead to osteoarthritis. Treatments for damaged cartilage include relieving symptoms, surgically cleaning up the joint, or surgically re‐establishing the cartilage layer. The latter is done using marrow stimulation techniques (such as microfracture), mosaicplasty (also known as osteochondral cylinder transplantation), and more recently with implantation of healthy cartilage cells (chondrocytes). In the technique of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), a small piece of cartilage is retrieved from the knee joint. This piece is brought to a laboratory where it is digested to free the chondrocyte cells; these cells are subsequently cultured in a culture media in order to expand the numbers of cells. Then, with a second surgery, the cells are placed into the joint defect in an effort to produce a tissue that substitutes the normal cartilage. 
This review includes six small randomised controlled trials that compared ACI with either mosaicplasty or microfracture. Although there are some promising results for ACI compared with microfracture from one trial, the evidence from two other trials testing the same comparison did not confirm these. None of the other three trials testing different comparisons provided conclusive evidence in favour of ACI, although the longer‐term results suggest that the results for some types of ACI may improve over time. The review identified several ongoing trials that should help to provide evidence to inform on the use of ACI in the future. Meanwhile, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the use of ACI.
