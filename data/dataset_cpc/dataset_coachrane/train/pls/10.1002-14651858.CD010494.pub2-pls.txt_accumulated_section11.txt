Mobility training for increasing mobility and functioning in older people who are frail 
Background 
Frailty is common in older people. Frailty leads to an increased likelihood of falling, difficulty moving (e.g. walking) and functioning, admissions to hospital, and mortality. It is estimated that 21% of the community‐dwelling population over 65 years are frail. Mobility training involves controlled movements of your body to perform specific tasks. Examples of mobility training included practicing standing up and sitting down, walking along a walking track, or going up and down stairs. Mobility training can be used when people have difficulties performing these tasks. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to June 2021 and includes 12 studies with a total of 1317 participants. The studies were conducted in nine countries. The average participant age in the included studies was 82 years old; 73% of the participants were women. Six trials reported funding by government and research institutions, and one study reported funding from a commercial advocacy group. 
Key results 
‐ Mobility improved by 8% (4% higher to 13% higher) upon completion of the training period (12 studies, 1151 participants). People with no mobility training scored 4.69 points (out of 12 on the Short Physical Performance Battery scale; a higher score indicates better mobility). People with mobility training scored 5.69 points. 
‐ Function improved by 9% (3% higher to 14% higher) upon completion of the training period (9 studies, 916 participants). People with no mobility training scored 86.1 points (out of 100 on the Barthel Index; a higher score indicates better functioning). People with mobility training scored 94.68 points. 
‐ Unwanted or harmful effects of the training decreased by 19% (9% fewer to 26% fewer) (2 studies, 225 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 771 people with no mobility training would experience unwanted or harmful effects, whereas 562 people with mobility training would experience unwanted or harmful effects. 
‐ Admissions to nursing care facilities decreased by 4% (8% more to 12% fewer) (1 study, 241 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 248 people with no mobility training would have an admission to a nursing care facility, whereas 208 people with mobility training would have an admission to a nursing care facility. 
‐ Falls increased by 1% (12% more to 7% fewer) (2 studies, 425 participants). If 1000 people were followed over 1 year, 573 people with no mobility training would have a fall, whereas 584 people with mobility training would have a fall.
