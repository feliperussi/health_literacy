Can medicines that block interleukin‐6 (a protein involved in immune responses) treat COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
Treating COVID‐19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin‐6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment. 
Studies of other medicines that block interleukin‐6 to treat COVID‐19 are under way. We will update this review when results from them become available. 
COVID‐19 
COVID‐19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus. If the infection becomes severe, people may need intensive care and support in hospital, including machines to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Medicines that are currently used to treat other diseases are being tested in the search to find effective treatments for COVID‐19. 
Blocking interleukin‐6 
An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against harmful substances, such as viruses. COVID‐19 can disrupt the immune system, causing it to over‐react and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation. Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a protein involved in triggering inflammation. Blocking the production of interleukin‐6 could reduce inflammation and help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Tocilizumab and sarilumab are two medicines that block interleukin‐6. They are used to treat other conditions that involve an "over‐reactive" immune system, such as rheumatoid arthritis. We wanted to find out if medicines that block interleukin‐6 can be used to treat COVID‐19, and whether they might cause any unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested if medicines that block interleukin‐6 could treat COVID‐19. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided by chance. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment.
