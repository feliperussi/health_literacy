Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing blood pressure disorders and related problems 
What is the issue? 
Pre‐eclampsia is evident as high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It is a major cause of death in pregnant women and newborn babies worldwide. Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) is often caused by high blood pressure and is the leading cause of newborn deaths, particularly in low‐income countries. 
Why is this important? 
Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that calcium supplements help prevent pre‐eclampsia and preterm birth and lower the risk of a woman dying or having serious problems related to high blood pressure in pregnancy. This is particularly for women on low calcium diets. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 18 September 2017, and found 27 trials. We found evidence from 13 studies (involving 15,730 women) that calcium supplementation in high doses (at least 1 gram (g) daily) during pregnancy may be a safe way of reducing the risk of pre‐eclampsia, especially in women from communities with low dietary calcium and those at increased risk of pre‐eclampsia. Women receiving calcium supplements may also be less likely to die or have serious problems related to pre‐eclampsia (low‐quality evidence) and high blood pressure. Babies may be less likely to be born preterm (low‐quality evidence). The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets was increased with calcium, but the absolute numbers were small (high‐quality evidence). High‐dose calcium did not have a clear effect on babies admitted to neonatal intensive care, or the number of stillbirths or deaths before discharge from hospital.
