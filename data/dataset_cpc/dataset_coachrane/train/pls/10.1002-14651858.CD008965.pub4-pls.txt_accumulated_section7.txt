Regulatory information on trials of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) for influenza in adults and children 
Oseltamivir and zanamivir have been stockpiled in many countries to treat and prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza, before an influenza vaccine matched to the circulating virus becomes available. Oseltamivir is classified by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine. 
How this review has been approached 
We have updated and combined our reviews on the antiviral drugs zanamivir and oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children on the basis of the manufacturers' reports to regulators (clinical study reports) and the regulators' comments. We have called these comments and reports 'regulatory information'. Clinical study reports are unpublished, extensive documents with great detail on the trials that formed the basis for market approval. They include the protocols, methods and results. Clinical study reports have until now been confidential, seen only by the manufacturers and regulators. 
Why we have taken this approach 
In previous versions of this review we identified unresolved discrepancies in the data presented in published trial reports and substantial publication bias. As a consequence, we elected not to use data from journal articles but included the documents generated during licensing processes. We have accessed such data from the UK, USA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), Japanese regulators and clinical study reports from the manufacturers (after a protracted media campaign). This has enabled us to verify information from the randomised, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trials on adults and children with confirmed or suspected exposure to naturally occurring influenza. 
Based on our assessments of the regulatory documents (in excess of 160,000 pages), we came to the conclusion that there were substantial problems with the design, conduct, reporting and availability of information from many of the trials.
