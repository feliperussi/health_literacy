Interventions for treating urinary stones in children
Review question 
What is the evidence for treating stones of the kidney or ureter in children?
Background 
Urinary stones occur in up to 5 in 100 children in high‚Äêincome countries. These rates have been noted to be increasing. To treat urinary stones in children, urologists use medications, shock wave therapy, open surgery, and small scopes that are put into the bladder or through the skin. It is not clear how well each of these treatments work and what the side effects are. 
Study characteristics 
We included 14 studies with a total of 978 randomised children with stones in either the kidney or ureter, which connects the kidney to the bladder. The number of children in the studies varied from 22 to 221 children. There were seven trials of different types of surgery, four trials of medications and one study that compared medication with surgery. The amount of time the trials followed participants for ranged from one week to one year. 
Key results 
Shock waves versus medication to dissolve stones: we are uncertain about the effect on successful removal of stones, serious complications and the need for a second procedure to treat the stones. 
Shock waves given slowly versus shock waves given fast: we are uncertain about the effect of slow shock waves on successful removal of stones. We are also uncertain about the effect on serious complications and the need for other procedures. 
Shock waves versus treatment using a scope through the bladder to break up the stone: we are uncertain about the effect of shock waves on successful removal of stones compared to using a scope. We are also uncertain about the effect on serious complications and the need for other procedures.
