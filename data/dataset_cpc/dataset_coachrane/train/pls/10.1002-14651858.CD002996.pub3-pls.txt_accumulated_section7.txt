Inhaled hyperosmolar agents for bronchiectasis
Review question 
We wanted to know if inhaled hyperosmolar agents ‐ treatments which help people cough up sputum ‐ may be helpful for people with bronchiectasis. We only included trials on people who had bronchiectasis and who did not have cystic fibrosis. Therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions for people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, problems in the lung structure, tuberculosis, and cystic fibrosis). A lot of mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and the need to cough it up. The phlegm also collects bacteria, which can add to breathing difficulties and make people very ill by causing recurring lung infections that are difficult to clear with antibiotics. Breathing in (inhaling) hypertonic saline (salt solutions with a greater salt content than blood) liquids may help clear this mucus, as may the drug mannitol (inhaled in dry powder form). This is because the concentrated salt or sugar (mannitol) draws water into the mucus in the lung and makes it thinner and easier to cough out. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 randomised controlled trials on 1021 participants that compared inhaled hyperosmolar agents versus no mucolytic treatment. Five studies compared inhaled mannitol versus placebo (with a total of 883 participants) and two very small studies (with a total of just 25 participants) compared inhaled mannitol with no treatment. We also found four studies (with a total of 113 participants) that compared hypertonic saline with isotonic (normal) saline.
