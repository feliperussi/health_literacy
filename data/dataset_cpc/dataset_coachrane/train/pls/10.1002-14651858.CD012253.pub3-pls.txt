Clonazepam add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant epilepsy in adults and children
Review question This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam when used as an add‐on therapy for adults and children with drug‐resistant focal onset or generalised onset epileptic seizures, when compared with placebo or another antiepileptic agent. 
Background Epilepsy affects about 70 million people worldwide, and nearly a quarter of patients with seizures have drug‐resistant epilepsy. Clonazepam is one of the 1,4‐benzodiazepine drugs commonly used in epilepsy management, and recommended for second‐line adjunctive treatment for various types of seizures. Previous studies have shown that clonazepam is effective in comparison with placebo when used as a supplement to existing medication for people with an insufficient response to conventional antiepileptic treatment. 
Review methods We searched different databases that contain both published and unpublished results of medical studies. We planned to include only randomised controlled studies (i.e. studies in which participants are randomly allocated to one or more treatments), which are considered the gold‐standard of experimental studies in research literature. Two review authors planned to independently select studies for inclusion, extract relevant data, and assess trial quality. 
Key results We found no double‐blind randomised controlled trials that considered clonazepam as an add‐on therapy for adults and children with resistant focal or generalised onset epileptic seizures, thus its efficacy and tolerability could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for double‐blind randomised controlled trials of clonazepam as an add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant epilepsy. 
The evidence is current to June 2019.
