Reduction in the number of antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia
Key messages 
– Reducing the number of antipsychotics may be associated with more participants leaving the study early, especially due to inefficacy. 
‐ The low number of studies and participants do not allow us to make strong conclusions.
Introduction 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder. People with the illness struggle to differentiate between their own thoughts, beliefs and ideas versus reality. For example, they may be hearing voices in their head but it feels like someone is really talking to them.  It is mainly treated with medications called antipsychotics. Often people with schizophrenia are offered treatment with more than one antipsychotic in order to achieve an effective treatment. Use of antipsychotics is connected with side effects, and the different antipsychotics could interact, making side effects worse. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if reducing the number of antipsychotics was better than keeping the same number of antipsychotics to improve:  
– quality of life 
– number of people readmitted to hospital
– number of people leaving the study early because of side effects
– a person's daily functioning
– relapse
– number of people leaving the study early for any reason
– number of people with at least one side effect.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that examined reducing the number of antipsychotics compared with keeping the same number of antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found five studies that involved 319 participants with schizophrenia. The studies lasted between three months and one year. They were conducted in Canada, Japan, Finland and two in the USA, and were all sponsored by public institutions.
