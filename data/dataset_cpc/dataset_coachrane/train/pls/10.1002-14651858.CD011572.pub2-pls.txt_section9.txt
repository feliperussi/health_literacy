Sixty‐one trials were included which evaluated 58 induction phases (5111 patients randomised to placebo) and 12 maintenance phases (1579 patients randomised to placebo). The researchers found that placebo response and remission rates varied according to which class of drug was being tested with the highest placebo response rates observed for biological drugs (genetically engineered medications made from living organisms). The highest placebo remission rates were observed for trials evaluating aminosalicylates (a type of anti‐inflammatory drug). The lowest placebo response and remission rates were in trials that assessed corticosteroids (drugs that suppress inflammation and immunity). The requirement of a minimum rectal bleeding score for study eligibility was associated with an increased placebo response rate compared to studies that did not use rectal bleeding for trial eligibility. The time point of primary outcome assessment was found to be significantly associated with placebo remission rates such that every one week increment in endpoint assessment was associated with an increase in the placebo remission rate. There were several trial design features that were associated with lower placebo response and remission rates. A key finding was that trials enrolling patients with more severe endoscopic disease (i.e. inflammation of the colon as confirmed by a colonoscopy) at trial entry were associated with lower placebo response and remission rates, which underpins the importance of objectively ensuring that patients enrolled into UC trials have sufficient disease severity. Disease duration of greater than five years prior to trial enrolment was associated with a significantly lower placebo response rate compared to disease duration of less than or equal to five years. The researchers also found that placebo rates have remained stable from 2008 to 2015.
