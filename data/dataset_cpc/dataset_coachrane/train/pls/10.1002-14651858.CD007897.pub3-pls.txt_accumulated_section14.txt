Interventions for preventing or reducing respiratory tract infections and asthma symptoms in mould‐damaged buildings 
Review question 
Our aim was to find out if repairing buildings damaged by dampness and mould reduces or prevents respiratory symptoms and asthma. 
Background 
Moisture damage is a very common problem in private houses, workplaces and public buildings globally. It has been associated with asthma and respiratory symptoms of the inhabitants. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 studies with 8028 participants. Three were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and nine were non‐RCTs with a control group. The repairs aimed to remove mould and dampness from family houses, schools or, in one study, an office building. 
Key results 
Repair of houses compared to no repair  
Repairing houses to remove mould reduced asthma‐related symptoms and respiratory infections compared to doing nothing. It also decreased the use of asthma medication in asthmatics. The repair of an office damaged by mould also reduced asthma and respiratory symptoms compared to an office that was not repaired. Full or partial repair did not result in a difference in symptoms. However, the evidence was of low to very low quality. 
Repair of houses compared to information for the inhabitants  
There was moderate‐quality evidence that there was no clear benefit from repair of houses on asthma symptoms among asthmatic children. 
Repair of schools compared to schools without problems  
Out of many symptom measures only pupils' visits to physicians due to a common cold were less frequent after the building was repaired. For other respiratory symptoms of the pupils, the results were inconsistent.
