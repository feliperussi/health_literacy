Laboratory blood, urine tests and liver biopsy used for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children and adults 
Why is improving Wilson's disease diagnosis important? 
Wilson's disease is an inherited disease that leads to a build‐up of copper in affected parts of the body. Diagnosis usually occurs in children or young adults, but has been seen in adults over 60 years of age. Copper build‐up begins in the liver progressing over time to affect the brain; however, the challenge for doctors is that liver disease in Wilson's disease has non‐specific features and standard liver blood tests may be normal, even with advanced scarring of the liver or cirrhosis. Early diagnosis allows earlier treatment, however, other causes of chronic liver disease may cause false‐positive results and, depending on cut‐off values used for testing, may result in further unnecessary testing. Conversely, false‐negative results may also arise when a single‐test strategy for diagnosis is used, possibly leading to a delay in treatment. 
What is the aim and what was included in this review? 
We aimed to examine the accuracy of three commonly used diagnostic tests to correctly identify Wilson's disease. These tests are: caeruloplasmin (a protein that carries copper in blood); copper in the urine; and copper in the liver. Initial evaluation usually involves checking an individual's eyes for signs of Wilson's disease and a blood test for caeruloplasmin, as this is the most widely accessible biochemical test for Wilson's disease. However, the pathway to diagnosing Wilson's disease is highly variable. Follow‐up testing depends on results of initial testing, plus the ability to access relevant tests and the likelihood with which the doctor believes the individual has Wilson's disease.
