What are the benefits and risks of exercise for adults with cancer who experience loss of appetite and weight loss? 
Key message 
We do not know if exercise is helpful or safe for people with cancer who experience loss of appetite and weight loss. This is because too few robust studies have tested exercise with this group of patients. We need researchers to conduct rigorous and better designed studies in this area in future to help patients and clinicians decide if exercise could be beneficial. 
Why did we set out to review the literature? 
Many people with cancer experience loss of appetite and weight loss (cancer cachexia), because of the cancer itself or its treatment. Cachexia is more common in some types of cancer, such as lung and pancreatic, and in advanced stages of cancer. It can compromise the ability to live independently and increase the need for care due to fatigue, muscle weakness and impaired quality of life. 
There is currently no standard treatment for cachexia. One treatment option would be for patients to exercise and see if that helps to strengthen their muscles and stop or slow down their weight loss and muscle wasting. 
We reviewed the evidence from clinical trials to find out if exercise, alone or in combination with other treatments (such as medicines, health education or information, and practical advice about nutrition) is beneficial for people with cancer cachexia. We wanted to know if exercise improved: 
· lean body mass (total body weight minus body fat);
· muscle strength and muscle endurance (ability of the muscle to repeat an exercise over an extended time); 
· exercise capacity (maximum amount of physical effort that someone can sustain);
· fatigue; and
· health‐related quality of life (ability to participate in family and social life as well as some degree of self‐care and the perception of self‐efficacy) 
We also looked at whether:
· people did the amount of exercise they were prescribed and
· exercise was associated with any risks (unwanted effects).
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of exercise, alone or with other treatments, in people with cancer cachexia. We then compared and summarised the results. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies.
