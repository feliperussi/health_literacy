Which studies were included in the review?  
Review authors searched databases to May 2015 to find all relevant trials. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include both children and adolescents exposed to trauma. 
We included 51 trials with a total of 6201 participants. Participants had been exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three. In one trial each, participants had suffered a life‐threatening illness or had been physically abused or maltreated. Participants in the remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas. 
Most trials compared psychological therapy with a control condition such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment; others compared different psychological therapies.
