Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment.
