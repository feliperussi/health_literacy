Opioids for the treatment of chronic low‐back pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of opioids on pain and function among people with chronic low‐back pain (CLBP). 
Background 
Opioids are pain relievers that act on the central nervous system. People with low‐back pain (LBP) use these drugs to relieve pain. We examined whether the use of opioids for at least four weeks was better or worse than other treatments of CLBP. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials, both published and unpublished, up to October 2012. We included fifteen trials which included 5540 participants and compared opioids against a placebo (fake medication) or other drugs that have been used for LBP. Most people included in the trials were aged 40 to 50 years and all reported at least moderate pain across the low‐back area. The trials included a slightly higher proportion of women. Most of the trials followed the patients during three months and were supported by the pharmaceutical industry.    
Key results 
In general, people that received opioids reported more pain relief and had less difficulty performing their daily activities in the short‐term than those who received a placebo. However, there is little data about the benefits of opioids based on objective measures of physical functioning. We have no information from randomized controlled trials supporting the efficacy and safety of opioids used for more than four months. Furthermore, the current literature does not support that opioids are more effective than other groups of analgesics for LBP such as anti‐inflammatories or antidepressants. 
This review partially supports the effectiveness of several opioids for CLBP relief and function in the short‐term. However, the effectiveness of prescribing of these medications for long‐term use is unknown and should take into consideration the potential for serious adverse effects, complications, and increased risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and deaths.
