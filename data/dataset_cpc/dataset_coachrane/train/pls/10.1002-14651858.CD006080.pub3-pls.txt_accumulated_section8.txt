Through the skin pinning for treating wrist fractures in adults
Background 
Broken wrists are fractures at the lower end of the radius, one of the two forearm bones. Typically in older people, these can occur when people put out a hand to break a fall. The broken bones are often pushed apart, resulting in a 'displaced' fracture. 
For most broken wrists, the bones can be moved back together (reduced) and held in place without an operation by a plaster cast for a few weeks. When fractures are unstable, the parts do not stay together. Another way of managing broken wrists is to hold the bones back in place with a surgical procedure, such as percutaneous pinning. This involves the insertion of pins or wires through the skin (percutaneous) to hold the bones in a proper position while they heal. In most pinning methods, pins or wires are used to fix the fragments together. In Kapandji pinning, the wires are placed to support the distal (lower end) fragment. 
Methods 
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials testing the use of percutaneous pinning or comparing aspects of pinning. Beforehand, we set out the main outcomes: patient‐reported function, numbers of participants with any complication and with complications requiring further treatment, grip strength and health‐related quality of life. We searched medical databases up to June 2019. 
Results of the search 
We included 26 randomised studies involving 1946 generally older and female adults with potentially unstable wrist fractures. The studies tested one of 10 comparisons and overall under‐reported outcomes. Below, we report only the main outcomes for which evidence was available.
