Effect of return‐to‐work coordination programmes for workers on sick leave
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to compare the effect of return‐to‐work coordination programmes to usual practice in workers on sick leave or disability. 
Key messages 
We found that return‐to‐work coordination programmes had no effects compared to usual practice on return‐to‐work outcomes. These outcomes were time to return to work, cumulative sickness absence, the proportion of workers at work at the end of the follow‐up and the proportion who had ever returned to work. We found no benefits in the short term, long term or very long term. 
We found only small benefits in patient‐reported outcomes. All these effects were smaller than the so‐called minimal clinically important difference. 
What was studied in the review? 
Returning long‐term sick‐leave workers back to work is important for society, employers and certainly for workers themselves. Possible interventions for this purpose are return‐to‐work coordination programmes, also described as case management or collaborative care. These programmes involve a number of health professionals collaborating with the workers to help them overcome their incapacity to work. Return‐to‐work coordination programmes vary in duration and design. In general, they include an assessment of the obstacles impeding a return to work and an individualised plan to eliminate barriers and return workers to employment. Treatment components may include counselling, physical or occupational therapy, and specialist care. 
Return‐to‐work coordination programmes require substantial resources. However, it is uncertain how effective they are. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 12,568 workers with musculoskeletal or mental health problems. Workers had to be on sick leave for a minimum of four weeks.
