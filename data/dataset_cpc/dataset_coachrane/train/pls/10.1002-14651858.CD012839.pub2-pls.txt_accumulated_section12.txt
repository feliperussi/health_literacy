Diets for inducing and maintaining remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim was to find out what diets can be used to induce or maintain remission in people with IBD. 
What is IBD? 
IBD involves inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are the most common types of IBD. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and rectal bleeding. IBD is characterized by periods of relapse where people experience symptoms of active disease and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. While some foods may provoke IBD symptoms, little is known about whether diets help to induce or maintain remission in IBD. 
How up to date is the review? 
We searched for studies up to 31 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 18 studies including 1878 participants. The diets studied included reduction or exclusion of foods believed to provoke IBD symptoms. These diets were compared with 'usual' diets. The studies assessed dietary interventions for active CD (six studies), inactive CD (seven studies), active UC (one study) and inactive UC (four studies). One study recruited children, while the rest included adults. The studies were poorly designed and had few participants. As a result the overall quality of the evidence was very low. 
The effect of high fiber, low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle, low calcium, symptoms‐guided diet and highly restricted organic diet on clinical remission in active CD is uncertain. In one study, remission was achieved at 4 weeks in 100% (4/4) of low refined carbohydrates participants compared to 0% (0/3) of usual diet participants. In a pooled analysis of two studies, 44% (23/52) of low microparticle participants achieved remission at 16 weeks compared to 25% (13/51) of usual diet participants. One study found that 50% (16/32) of symptoms‐guided participants achieved remission compared to 0% (0/19) of usual diet participants. One study found that 50% (4/8) of highly‐restricted organic diet participants achieved remission at 24 weeks compared to 50% (5/10) of usual diet participants. One study found that 37% (16/43) of low‐calcium participants achieved remission at 16 weeks compared to 30% (12/40) of usual diet participants. 
The effect of low refined carbohydrate, symptoms‐guided and low red processed meat diets on relapse in inactive CD is uncertain. In a pooled analysis of three studies, 67% (176/264) of low refined carbohydrate participants relapsed at 12 to 24 months compared to 64% (193/303) of usual diet participants. In a pooled analysis of two studies, 48% (24/50) of symptoms‐guided participants relapsed at 6 to 24 months compared to 83% (40/48) of usual diet participants. One study found that 66% (63/96) of low red and processed meat participants relapsed at 48 weeks compared to 63% (75/118) of usual diet participants. One study showed that 0% (0/16) of exclusion diet participants (i.e. low disaccharides, grains, saturated fats, red and processed meat) relapsed at 12 months compared to 26% (10/38) of usual diet participants. 
The effect of a symptoms‐guided diet on clinical remission in active UC is uncertain. In one study, 36% (4/11) of symptoms‐guided participants achieved remission at six weeks compared to 0% (0/10) in the usual diet group.
