Treatment options to manage relapse of lower front teeth after orthodontic treatment
Review question  The main question addressed by this review is how effective are fixed braces or removable retainers for managing relapse of lower front teeth after orthodontic treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. 
Background  An important problem for patients completing orthodontic treatment is maintaining their lower front teeth in the corrected position (known as managing relapse) and preventing teeth from returning to their original positions. After orthodontic treatment, less than half of patients maintain alignment of their lower front teeth for the next 10 years, and even fewer (10%) maintain alignment for 20 years. Managing relapse is important in order to avoid wasting time, money and resources, and to maintain both the appearance and function of well‐aligned teeth. There are two types of appliances (retainers) used to manage relapse; retainers which are fixed to the teeth or retainers able to be removed for cleaning. 
The most commonly used fixed retainers are:
• normal braces that have brackets attached to the lips‐side of teeth (labial braces); • braces with brackets attached to the tongue‐side of teeth (lingual braces); or • a fixed flexible wire attached to the tongue‐side of teeth without using brackets. 
The most common removable retainers are:
• retainers made from wire and acrylic (Hawley’s retainer), with or without the addition of springs to apply force; or • clear 'invisible' aligners, free from metal brackets and wires, which are computer‐generated to fit over the patient's lower teeth and move teeth in order.
