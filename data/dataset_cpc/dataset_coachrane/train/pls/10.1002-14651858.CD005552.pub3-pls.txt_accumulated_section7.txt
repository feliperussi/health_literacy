Metformin versus the combined oral contraceptive pill for excessive facial/body hair, acne, and menstrual disorders in polycystic ovary syndrome 
Review question  
Is Metformin more effective and safer than the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (alone or in combination) in improving clinical, hormonal, and metabolic features (irregular/prolonged menstrual cycles, excessive facial and body hair, acne, obesity) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? 
Background  
PCOS is a common hormonal and metabolic problem affecting approximately 1 in 10 women of childbearing age, often resulting in infrequent menstrual periods, excess body and facial hair, acne and polycystic ovaries (enlarged ovaries due to numerous small collections of fluid (follicles)). The OCP has long been a proven effective treatment for women with PCOS who are not trying to fall pregnant. More recently, metformin (a medication that lowers insulin and blood sugar levels and often used to treat type 2 diabetes) has been advocated as possibly a more effective and safer long‚Äêterm treatment than the OCP in women with PCOS. Therefore, it is important to directly compare the benefits and risks of these two treatments in women with PCOS. 
Study characteristics  
We found 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing metformin versus the OCP (alone or in combination) in a total of 2253 women with PCOS which comprised 39 RCTs on adult women (2047 women) and five RCTs on adolescent women (206 women). We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current to August 2019.
