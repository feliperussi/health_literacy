Laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy
Review question 
Is laser photocoagulation an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy?
Background 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common problem for people with diabetes and can lead to loss of vision. The back of the eye (retina) can develop problems because of diabetes, including the growth of harmful new blood vessels (proliferative DR, referred to here as 'PDR'). Laser photocoagulation is a commonly used treatment for DR in which the eye doctor uses a laser on the back of the eye to stop some of the harmful changes. 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies. The searches were done in April 2014. Three studies were done in the USA, one study in the UK and one study in Japan. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. Most participants had PDR. 
Key results 
We found that moderate vision loss at 12 months was similar in eyes treated with laser and eyes that were not treated, but similar assessments made at a later date showed that eyes treated with laser were less likely to have suffered moderate vision loss. Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months. There was a similar effect on the progression of DR. None of the studies reported patient‚Äêrelevant outcomes such as pain or loss of driving licence. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find very many studies and those we found were done quite a long time ago when standards of trial conduct and reporting were lower. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low, with the exception of the results for severe visual loss, which we judged to be moderate quality evidence.
