Treatment to prevent first bleeding from dilated veins in the oesophagus resulting from advanced scarring of the liver 
What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
We aimed to find the best available treatment for prevention of first bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus)) in people with advanced liver scarring (liver cirrhosis, or late stage scarring of the liver with complications). People with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices are at significant risk of bleeding and death. Therefore, treatment is important, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The review authors collected and analysed 66 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with the aim of finding what the best treatment is. During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane methods, which allow the comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (referred to as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis').

Key messages 
We found that only one of the trials was conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is high to very high uncertainty in the findings. Approximately one in five trial participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices who never had bleeding previously and received the standard treatment of beta‐blockers died within five years of treatment. 
The funding source for the research was unclear in 50 trials; commercial organisations funded five trials. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining 11 trials.
