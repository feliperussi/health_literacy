Hysteroscopy for treating suspected abnormalities of the cavity of the womb in women having difficulty becoming pregnant 
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effect of the hysteroscopic treatment of suspected abnormalities of the cavity of the womb in women having difficulty becoming pregnant. 
Background 
Human life starts when a fertilised egg has successfully implanted in the inner layer of the cavity of the womb. It is believed that abnormalities originating from this site, such as polyps (abnormal growth of tissue), fibroids (non‐cancerous growth), septa (upside‐down, triangular‐shaped piece of tissue which divides the womb) or adhesions (scar tissue that sticks the walls of the womb together), may disturb this event. The removal of these abnormalities by doing a hysteroscopy using a very small diameter inspecting device might therefore increase the chance of becoming pregnant either spontaneously or after specialised fertility treatment, such as insemination or in vitro fertilisation. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies. The first study compared the removal of fibroids versus no removal in 94 women wishing to become pregnant spontaneously from January 1998 to April 2005. The second study compared the removal of polyps versus simple hysteroscopy only in 204 women before insemination with husband's sperm from January 2000 to February 2004. The evidence is current to April 2018. Neither study reported funding sources. 
Key results 
In women with fibroids wishing to become pregnant spontaneously we were uncertain whether removal of the fibroids improved the pregnancy or miscarriage rate compared to usual management: uncertainty remains because the number of women (94) and the number of pregnancies (30) were too small and the quality of the evidence was very low. We found no data on live birth or complications due to surgery. We found no studies on women with polyps, septa or adhesions.
