Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for management of pain in women with endometriosis
What is the issue? 
Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition that commonly affects women of childbearing age. It can lead to painful symptoms, including painful periods, pain during or after sexual intercourse, pelvic and lower abdominal pain and infertility. It can greatly affect women's quality of life by impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used as first‐line treatment for women with endometriosis because they have few side effects, and many are available over the counter. 
Why is this important? 
Endometriosis is very common, but the condition can be difficult to diagnose. In 2015, 1.8 billion women (aged 15 to 49 years) in the world had received a diagnosis of endometriosis. It is estimated that up to 60% of women with painful periods have endometriosis. Endometriosis greatly affects women's quality of life, impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility. An unpublished survey conducted by a patient support organisation in the United Kingdom ‐ Endometriosis UK (www.endometriosis‐uk.org/) ‐ found that 65% of women with endometriosis reported that their condition had negatively affected their employment. Ten per cent of women had to reduce their hours of work, and 30% had not been able to continue in the same employment. As many as 16% of women were unable to continue in any employment, and 6% needed to claim state benefits; thus, in addition to their feelings of loss as contributors to society, they became dependent upon others. This increased their feelings of low self‐esteem. Endometriosis is seen as a significant public health issue because a large number of women are affected and illnesses associated with this disease are significant.
