Dietary patterns for adults with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue? 
People who have kidney disease can experience a lower life expectancy, complications including heart disease, and may need treatment for severe kidney failure, such as dialysis. Patients and doctors wish to identify treatments that protect people against kidney failure or heart disease. For both doctors and people who have kidney disease, lifestyle changes such as diet are very important as possible ways to improve health and well‐being, and provide people with a chance to 'self‐manage' their care for kidney disease. 
What did we do? 
We combined all studies looking at dietary changes for people who kidney disease including people treated with dialysis or who have a kidney transplant. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies involving 1639 people who had chronic kidney disease that looked into whether diet changes or advice improved their health. Studies included men and women with mainly moderate or severe kidney disease. Diets involved increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing poultry and fish, higher nut and olive oil use, and some increases in cereals and legumes (e.g. beans), and less red meat, sugar, and salt. We looked particularly at three key outcomes: the risk of death, the risk of advanced kidney disease requiring dialysis, and quality of life. There were four studies involving people who have had a kidney transplant and three studies involving people treated with dialysis. 
After combining the available studies, it was uncertain whether making healthy diet changes prevented heart complications as most studies did not measure these. Diet changes may improve life quality. We did see that some risk factors for future disease, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were lower following diet counselling or healthier eating.
