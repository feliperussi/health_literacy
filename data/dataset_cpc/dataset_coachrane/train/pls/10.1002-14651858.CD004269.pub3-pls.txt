Platelet transfusions are used to prevent bleeding in patients with low platelet counts due to treatment‚Äêinduced bone marrow failure 
This review was undertaken to determine the best use of platelet transfusions for the prevention of bleeding in patients who have haematological disorders and are receiving intensive (myelosuppressive) chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. The review aimed to look at three main topics. One, what is the evidence to indicate if platelet transfusions should be given to prevent bleeding as compared to a strategy aimed at transfusion when bleeding occurs? Second, if platelet transfusions are given to prevent bleeding, when should they be given, for example, at what level of platelet count when measured in a blood sample? Three, if platelet transfusions are given what platelet dose should be used? We are unable to answer the first question, however new data from two large studies should be available when this review is updated in approximately two years time. With regard to the second question, there is no evidence to suggest a change from the current practice of using a platelet count of 10 x 109/L to trigger the use of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. However, more research is required to clarify this issue. The final question can be answered. Using a lower platelet dose did not lead to an increased risk of bleeding and fewer platelets were required. The reduction in the number of platelets used should, theoretically, reduce the risk of adverse events although no true differences were seen in the studies. However, adverse events are uncommon and therefore a statistically significant difference may not be seen.
