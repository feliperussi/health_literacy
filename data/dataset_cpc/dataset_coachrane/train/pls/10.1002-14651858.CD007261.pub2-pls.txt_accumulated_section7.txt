Interventions for managing osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint
Review question 
We conducted this review to assess different interventions for managing osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joint. 
Background 
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw joint is located in front of the ear on either side of the face. However, it is the only joint that the dentists and maxillofacial surgeons predominantly have to deal with. As with many of the other joints, the TMJ can be affected by osteoarthritis (OA). This is characterized by progressive destruction of the internal surfaces of the joint which can result in debilitating pain and joint noises. Several disorders other than OA may affect the TMJ and the correct diagnosis is important such that it can be matched with appropriate therapy. A range of therapeutic options are available for TMJ OA, which include non‐surgical modalities such as control of contributory factors, occlusal appliances, cold or warm packs applied to the joint, pharmacological interventions as well as physiotherapy. Surgical treatment options include intra‐articular injections, arthrocentesis (lavage of the joint) as well as attempts at repair or replacement of portions of the TMJ. 
Study characteristics 
Authors working with Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 26 September 2011. This review includes three studies: two conducted in Europe and one in North America. All participants (114) were recruited in university clinics. One study compared intra‐articular injections of sodium hyaluronate (a natural constituent of cartilage) with corticosteroids (betamethasone (an anti‐inflammatory steroid)); the second study compared diclofenac sodium (a non‐steroid anti‐inflammatory drug) with occlusal splint therapy; and the third study compared glucosamine sulfate or ibuprofen (a non‐steroid anti‐inflammatory).
