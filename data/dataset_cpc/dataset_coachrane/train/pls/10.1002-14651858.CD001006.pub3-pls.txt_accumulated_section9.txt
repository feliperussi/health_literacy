Can mass media campaigns (television, radio, newspapers, billboards and booklets) deter young people from starting to smoke? 
Background 
Smoking is a modern‐day epidemic, and preventing young people from taking up smoking remains a key health priority, since experimentation with smoking starts at an early age. One possible method of achieving this goal is through mass media, which have the potential to reach and modify the attitudes, knowledge and behaviour of a large proportion of the population. 
Review question 
Can mass media campaigns deter young people from taking up smoking?
Study characteristics 
We found eight studies out of 1326 publications, covering 52,746 participants. One of these studies is new to this updated version of the review. The most recent search was conducted in June 2016. All studies were directed at youth younger than 25 years. Seven studies were conducted in the USA and one was conducted in Norway. The mass media method (e.g. television) and certain characteristics of those taking part (e.g. age), as well as the length of time followed up, differed between studies. 
Key results 
Three out of eight studies found that the intervention was effective in preventing smoking in youth. The remaining five studies did not detect an effect. Although there was some overlap in characteristics between both effective and ineffective programmes, effective campaigns tended to last longer (minimum 3 years) and were more intense (more contact time) for both school‐based lessons (minimum eight lessons per grade) and media spots (minimum four weeks' duration across multiple media channels with between 167 and 350 TV and radio spots). Implementation of combined school‐based components (e.g. school posters) and the use of repetitive media messages delivered by multiple channels (e.g. newspapers, radio, television) appeared to contribute to successful campaigns.
