Antibiotics for sinus infection of short duration in adults
Review question 
Do antibiotics cure sinus infection faster than no antibiotics in adults?
Background 
A sinus is a cavity situated in the head. Adults with short‐duration sinus infection experience stuffy nose and thick, yellow discharge from the nose. People with sinus infection can feel slime in the back of the throat, facial pain, pain when bending forward, and pain in the upper teeth or when chewing. A short‐duration sinus infection may be suspected following physical examination and questions about symptoms. Blood examination or images of the sinuses can support diagnosis, but are not routinely recommended in most countries. Short‐duration sinus infections are mostly caused by viruses. Nevertheless, physicians tend to prescribe antibiotics, which should only be used to treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics unnecessarily results in antibiotic resistance against bacterial infections. We investigated whether antibiotics cure adults with short‐duration sinus infection faster than a dummy drug (placebo) or no treatment.

Study characteristics 
We included 15 studies in which adults with short‐duration sinus infection, whether or not confirmed by imaging, randomly received antibiotics, or a dummy drug or no treatment, in ambulatory care settings. The studies included a total of 3057 adults whose average age was 36 years; about 60% were female. Participants were followed until they were cured. Trial duration ranged from 8 to 28 days. 
Study funding sources 
Seven studies received financial support from government or academic institutions; six received grants from the pharmaceutical industry; and five did not state sources of support.
