Are hypoxia‐inducible factor stabilisers effective for management of anaemia among people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the issue? 
Anaemia (reduced levels of circulating red blood cells) is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anaemia is linked to cardiovascular disease, infection and death. Hypoxia‐inducible factors (HIF) stabilisers have now become available to manage anaemia and can be taken by mouth, thus avoiding injections. 
What did we do? 
We evaluated whether HIF stabilisers are beneficial for children and adults with CKD to manage anaemia. We evaluated all clinical studies for hypoxia‐inducible factor stabilisers and summarised the results. We evaluated how certain we could be about the evidence related to hypoxia‐inducible factors stabiliser using a system called "GRADE". 
What did we find? 
We included 51 studies randomising 30,994 adult patients. Patients in the studies were given a HIF stabiliser, a sugar pill (placebo), or erythropoietin treatment. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term (over a few weeks). There were no studies in children or people who had received a kidney transplant. 
HIF stabilisers decreased blood transfusions for people with CKD when compared to placebo or erythropoietin treatment. HIF stabilisers increased the number of patients reaching their haemoglobin target level when compared to placebo. HIF stabilisers have uncertain effects on life expectancy and the chance of heart disease in people with CKD. 
Conclusions 
HIF stabilisers decreased the need for a blood transfusion for people with CKD and increased the number of patients reaching their haemoglobin target level. We are not sure whether hypoxia‐inducible factor stabilisers have any impact on life expectancy or life quality in people with CKD when compared to a placebo or other treatments for anaemia.
