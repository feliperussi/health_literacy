Health workers' perceptions and experiences of using mHealth technologies to deliver primary healthcare services: a qualitative evidence synthesis 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review of qualitative research was to explore how health workers view and experience the use of mobile phones and tablets when delivering primary healthcare services. To answer this, we analysed 43 studies about health workers' views and experiences of mobile health (mHealth) programmes. 
Key messages 
Health workers welcomed the benefits of mHealth, and described how they used mobile phones to improve their work and relationships with each other and with clients. However, they also experienced challenges, including poor network coverage and access to electricity. People implementing mHealth programmes should try to address these challenges and build on health workers' positive experiences. 
What was studied in this review? 
Health workers often use mobile phones and tablets to provide services. It is important to understand what health workers think about these devices, as this can affect the quality of services. We looked for studies that explored health workers' views and experiences of using mobile devices in primary care. 
What are the main findings of this review? 
We sampled 43 of the 53 included studies in this review. Most were from low‐ or middle‐income countries, and included both lay health workers and health professionals. Many used mobile phones or tablets when delivering health care to mothers, children or newborns. Many of the mobile devices had software that helped health workers follow the correct steps when providing services. Health workers also used mobile phones to communicate with clients, and to record clients' health information.
