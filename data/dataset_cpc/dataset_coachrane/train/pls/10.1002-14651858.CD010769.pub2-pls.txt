Imipramine for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (as in a fall, a cut, or an arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated with different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are usually not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. 
Imipramine is from the same class of medicines as amitriptyline, which is widely recommended for treating neuropathic pain; imipramine may also be useful in these painful conditions. In 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials in which imipramine was used to treat neuropathic pain. 
We found five studies involving 168 participants with painful diabetic neuropathy or polyneuropathy. Studies were randomised and double‚Äêblind, but all had one or more sources of potential major bias that could lead to overestimation of efficacy. It was not possible to combine information from the different studies, but individually they indicated some benefit from imipramine (usually at a dose between 100 mg and 150 mg daily) compared with placebo, at the expense of increased adverse events. 
There was too little information, which was of inadequate quality, to be sure that imipramine works as a pain medicine in neuropathic pain due to diabetes or due to damage to multiple nerves. There was no information about other types of neuropathic pain. Other medicines have been shown to be effective.
