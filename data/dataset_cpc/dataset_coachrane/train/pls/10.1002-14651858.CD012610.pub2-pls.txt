Effects of lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) for women during pregnancy
Review question 
Is giving lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) to women during pregnancy good for mothers and their babies? 
Background 
Women's nutritional status before and during pregnancy plays a key role in fetal growth and development. It is important to address maternal undernourishment in order to improve maternal and child health. LNS aim to deliver nutrients to pregnant women and other vulnerable people, thereby providing a range of vitamins and minerals coupled with energy, protein and essential fatty acids. 
Study characteristics 
We found four studies with 8018 pregnant women. The oldest study was published in 2009. All studies took place in developing countries: three were in Africa (one apiece in Ghana, Malawi, and Burkina Faso), and one was in Asia (Bangladesh). All studies took place in a stable community setting; none were conducted in emergency settings. Of the four included studies, one compared LNS to iron folic acid (IFA), one compared LNS to multiple micronutrients (MMN), and two compared LNS to both IFA and MMN. 
Key results 
This review suggests that there may be a slight benefit of LNS on babies who are born small, and on newborn weight and length, when compared to IFA. LNS did not seem to give any additional benefit to women and newborns compared to MMN, and both IFA and MMN were better at reducing maternal anaemia than LNS. We did not find any studies on LNS for pregnant women in emergency settings. 
Quality of evidence 
Overall, the evidence is of moderate quality.
Currentness of evidence 
The evidence is current to May 2018.
