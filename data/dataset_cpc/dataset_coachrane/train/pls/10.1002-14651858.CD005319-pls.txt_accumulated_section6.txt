Acupuncture for shoulder pain
Does acupuncture work for treating shoulder pain?  To answer this question, scientists found and analyzed 9 research studies. The studies tested over 500 people who had shoulder pain. People had either acupuncture, a placebo (fake therapy), ultrasound, gentle movement or exercises usually for 20‐30 minutes, two to three times a week for 3 to 6 weeks. Even though the studies were small and not of the highest quality, this Cochrane review provides the best evidence we have today. 
What causes shoulder pain and how can acupuncture help?  Shoulder pain can be caused by a number of different conditions. It can be caused by rotator cuff disease, periarthritis or adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). Shoulder pain can sometimes go away on its own but may last up to 12 to 18 months. Drug and non‐drug treatments are used to relieve pain and/or swelling. Acupuncture is a non‐drug therapy being used more and more to treat shoulder pain. It is thought that acupuncture works either by releasing chemical compounds in the body that relieve pain, by overriding pain signals in the nerves or by allowing energy (Qi) or blood to flow freely through the body. It is not known whether acupuncture works or is safe. 
How well does acupuncture work?  The improvements with acupuncture for pain and function were about the same as the effects of receiving a fake therapy for 2 to 4 weeks. 
One study showed that acupuncture improved shoulder function more than fake therapy after 4 weeks. But after 4 months, improvements were about the same with only an improvement of 4 more points on a scale of 0 to 100 with acupuncture. 
One small study showed that acupuncture plus exercise was better than just exercise for improving pain, range of motion and function for up to 5 months.
