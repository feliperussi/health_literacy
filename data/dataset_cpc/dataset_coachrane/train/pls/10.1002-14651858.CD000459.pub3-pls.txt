Antipsychotic‐reduction and/or cessation and antipsychotics as specific treatments for tardive dyskinesia 
Review question 
To determine whether stopping or reducing antipsychotic drugs helps in the reduction of tardive dyskinesia for people with schizophrenia. To examine whether specific antipsychotic drugs could be a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. 
Background 
People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue, and jaw to convulse, spasm, and grimace. It is caused by long‐term use or high doses of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat, and can be incurable. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce a person’s exposure to antipsychotic drugs. These include lowering the dose of medication, intermittent ‘drug holidays’, and stopping taking antipsychotic medication altogether. 
Study characteristics 
The review includes 13 trials with a total of 711 people with schizophrenia and other psychiatric diagnoses. 
Key results 
Due to the poor quality, small size, and limited data from the 13 studies, there is limited evidence. It is not known if strategies such as dose reduction, ‘drug holidays’, and stopping medication are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. There is limited evidence on specific antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence is poor, small scale, and of short duration. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.
