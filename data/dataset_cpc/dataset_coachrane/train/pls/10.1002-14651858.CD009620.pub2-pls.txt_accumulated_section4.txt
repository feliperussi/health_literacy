Interferon therapy after surgery in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a potentially life‚Äêthreatening condition. EOC usually develops in women above 50 years of age and is rarely seen in women younger than 35 years old. Early symptoms of the disease are usually mild and vague, making this disease difficult to detect at an early stage. Patients with EOC are relatively asymptomatic until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. 
Although EOC initially responds well to surgery and chemotherapy, there is a high rate of recurrence within 12 to 24 months of treatment. Interferons are proteins that are made and released by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens. They are named after their ability to 'interfere' with viral replication within host cells. Interferon serves two important functions. It signals neighbouring cells and triggers their resistance mechanisms; and it activates other immune cells that kill invading pathogens. This review assessed the effectiveness of interferon therapy in reducing the rate of recurrence or prolonging the time between chemotherapy and subsequent recurrence of the disease. 
Five trials, including 1476 participants, were included in the review. Three of the five trials were stopped early. The risk of bias of most of the trials was high or unclear due to incomplete reporting of methods and results. Most of the trials were not large enough to detect any true effect of the intervention. Trials either did not report the results of important outcomes or the results of important outcomes were not uniform between the trials.
