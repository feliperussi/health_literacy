What was studied in the review?This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with advanced liver disease due to various causes and previous bleeding from oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for preventing further bleeding oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had bleeding from the stomach, who had no previous bleeding from the oesophageal varices, those who failed to respond to another treatment before study entry, and those who had liver transplantation previously. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 40 to 63 years. The treatments used in the trials included endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting into the enlarged veins by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting bands around the dilated veins by seeing through a tube inserted through the mouth), beta‐blockers (drugs that slow the heart and decrease the force of heart pumping resulting in decrease pressure in the blood vessels), and TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; an artificial channel that connects the different blood vessels that carry oxygen‐depleted blood (venous system)) within the liver to reduce the pressure built‐up in the portal venous system, one of the two venous systems draining the liver), portocaval shunt (performing surgery to create the artificial channel described for TIPS) among others. The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, recurrence of bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease.What were the main results of the review?The 48 studies included a small number of participants (3526 participants). Study data were sparse. Forty‐six studies with 3442 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up of the trial participants ranged from two months to five years.
