Using de‐escalation to prevent violence in aggressive people
Review questions 
Do de‐escalation techniques help to calm down adults who are being aggressive in care settings? Which techniques work best? 
Background 
There are many reasons why people may be aggressive in care settings, including mental or physical illness. People can use a range of techniques to help someone who is behaving aggressively to calm down, including talking to the person and interpreting non‐verbal gestures and body language. This approach is referred to as de‐escalation. Although it is widely taught and used, we know very little about how effective de‐escalation is, or which techniques work best. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for all available evidence on this topic, finding just two studies. One of these included 306 people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, living in 16 nursing homes in France. The second study is still in progress and did not provide results for the review. 
Key results 
The study did not assess areas important to us, such as the number of injuries sustained by staff or residents. It did, however, measure the impact of staff training on residents' level of aggression three months after the end of the training. Some measures of physical and verbal aggression showed reductions, but not all. 
Quality of the evidence 
The reliability of evidence available in the one included trial is very low and did not address important questions such as injury. Therefore, we cannot say whether de‐escalation techniques are effective. 
Currentness of evidence 
The evidence is current to September 2017.
