Participation in rehabilitation programmes that include regular exercise, can improve the quality of life for people with heart disease 
Background 
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) seeks to improve the function, health‐related quality of life and well‐being of people with heart disease through a combination of activities, in particular exercise training alongside educational and psychological support. Since the mid‐2000s, the number of published Cochrane reviews has grown to six systematic reviews/meta‐analyses of CR. These reviews assessed the impact of CR on different types of heart disease (e.g. following a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure) or different ways of providing CR (e.g. in a hospital‐ or home‐based setting, exercise only programmes or exercise in combination with an educational or psychological intervention or both). The aim of the overview was to review the current CR Cochrane reviews to provide a 'friendly front end' to this 'portfolio' of reviews. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for Cochrane reviews that analysed the data from randomised controlled trials (RCT; experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups), which looked at the effectiveness of CR in adults with heart disease and compared patient outcomes with a no‐exercise control group. This overview summarised the findings from these reviews. 
Key results 
We found six high‐quality Cochrane reviews that included 148 RCTs in 98,093 people who primarily had experienced a heart attack, had undergone cardiac surgery or had chronic heart failure. The findings of this overview showed important benefits of CR participation that included a reduction in the risk of hospital admissions, as well as improvements in health‐related quality of life compared with not undertaking rehabilitation.
