The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on live birth rate for poor responders, based on eight trials. If the chance of live birth without growth hormone is assumed to be 11%, the chance of live birth with growth hormone would be between 13% and 25%. Growth hormone results in a slight increase in pregnancy rates in poor responders, based on 11 trials with low‐certainty evidence. The results suggest, if the pregnancy rate without growth hormone is assumed to be 15%, with growth hormone use, the pregnancy rate in poor responders would be between 19% and 31%. The evidence suggests that growth hormone results in little to no difference in the number of women with at least one oocyte retrieved, based on two trials with low‐certainty evidence. If the chance of retrieving at least 1 egg in poor responders was 81%, with growth hormone the chance is between 87% and 99%. There is a slight increase in the mean number of oocytes retrieved with the use of growth hormone for poor responders, based on 12 trials with low‐certainty evidence. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of growth hormone on embryo transfer achieved, based on four trials. If the chance of achieving embryo transfer is assumed to be 77%, the chance with use of growth hormone will be between 78% and 94%. Use of growth hormone results in reduction of mean units of gonadotropins used for stimulation in poor responders, based on eight trials with low‐certainty evidence.
