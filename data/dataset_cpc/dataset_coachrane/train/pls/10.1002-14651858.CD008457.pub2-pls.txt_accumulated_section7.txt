Antiseptic treatment (chlorhexidine) to prevent tooth decay in children and young people 
Review question 
This review examined the effectiveness of varnishes and gels containing chlorhexidine in preventing tooth decay in children and young people. 
Background 
Tooth decay is a very common disease that over time destroys the tooth surface. It has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries and, despite being preventable through oral hygiene and dietary measures and the use of agents such as fluoride that reduce risk of decay, it is likely to remain a problem, especially in low‐income countries. Tooth decay can result in pain and infection, and in young children may require treatment in hospital under a general anaesthetic. As well as causing anxiety and pain, this may mean the child or young person missing time at school and their parents or carers having to take time off work, possibly losing income and incurring extra costs. Prevention of tooth decay is simpler and possibly cheaper than waiting until it occurs and then requires extensive treatment. 
Tooth decay is largely preventable, and a range of things may assist this: twice‐daily toothbrushing with a fluoride toothpaste, reducing both the amount of and number of times per day sugar is eaten, and drinking water that contains fluoride (bottled or tap, depending on where you live). 
Tooth decay occurs when certain types of bacteria (germs) in the mouth, such as Streptococcus mutans, produce acids from the sugar we eat, which dissolve the hard enamel coating on our teeth. The chemical antiseptic treatment chlorhexidine is highly successful at destroying these bacteria and can be used safely at home in the form of a gel, spray, chewing gum, toothpaste or mouthrinse. Alternatively, chlorhexidine can be applied as a varnish to the surface of teeth by a dentist.
