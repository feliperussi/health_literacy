Medical treatment of vascular risk factors for reducing death and cardiovascular events in people with abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Background 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life‐threatening condition where the aorta enlarges and can ultimately burst, leading to massive internal bleeding. Current guidelines recommend that AAAs of 55 mm or more should be surgically repaired because, at this size, the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of surgical repair. AAAs between 30 mm and 54 mm in size are not as high risk and are generally monitored by regular scans to check for further enlargement. Recent research has shown that even after the aneurysm is repaired, the survival rate in people with AAA is poorer than in people without AAA. In most cases, the cause of death is a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular death. However, both conditions can be reversed through medical treatment. Given the increased risk of mortality with AAA, it is important to determine which medical treatment is most effective in preventing cardiovascular death in people with AAA. 
In this review, researchers from Cochrane examined the effectiveness of medical treatment to treat vascular risk factors and reduce deaths and cardiovascular deaths and events in people with an AAA. 
Study characteristics and key results 
After searching for all relevant studies (until 14 April 2016), we found one study in which a subgroup of 227 people with AAA received either the beta‐blocker metoprolol (medication that reduces blood pressure) or a placebo (dummy treatment). This study's results were imprecise for all causes of death and death from cardiovascular disease or nonfatal cardiovascular events at 30 days or six months after AAA repair. Side effects from the drug were reported for the whole study population and were not available for the subgroup of participants with AAA.
