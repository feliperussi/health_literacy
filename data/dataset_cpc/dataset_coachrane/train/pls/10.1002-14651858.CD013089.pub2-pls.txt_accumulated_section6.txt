Radix Sophorae flavescentis for chronic hepatitis B
Review question  To assess the benefits and harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus placebo or no intervention in people with chronic hepatitis B. 
Background Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common liver disease that is associated with high morbidity and death. It causes psychological stress and is a burden to people with chronic hepatitis B and their families. Radix Sophorae flavescentis has been used in treating people with chronic hepatitis B; it is believed that it decreases discomfort and prevents replication of the virus in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, its benefits and harms remain unclear.

Study characteristics We included 35 randomised clinical trials with 3556 participants. One trial compared Radix Sophorae flavescentis with placebo; the remaining 34 trials compared effects of Radix Sophorae flavescentis in addition to a co‐intervention versus the same co‐intervention. The included trials assessed heterogenous forms and ways of administering Radix Sophorae flavescentis (e.g. oral capsules, oral tablets, intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection, acupoint (a specifically chosen site of acupuncture) injection) with treatment duration of 1 to 24 months. Two trials assessed children under 14 years of age. Participants in two trials had cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (late‐stage scarring of the liver). 
Study funding sources Seven of the 35 randomised clinical trials received academic funding from government or hospital. Four trials received no funding. The remaining 24 trials provided no information on funding. Undisclosed funding may influence trial results and may lead to poor trial design.
