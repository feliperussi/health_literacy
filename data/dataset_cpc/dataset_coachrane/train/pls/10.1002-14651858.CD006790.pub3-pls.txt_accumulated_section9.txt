Type I interferons for treatment of active ulcerative colitis
What is ulcerative colitis? 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long‐term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a need to hurry to the toilet to pass feces (fecal urgency). 
What are type I interferons? 
Interferons (IFNs) are drugs that regulate the immune system and have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic inflammatory disorders. People with UC who are experiencing disease symptoms have ‘active’ disease, periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers investigated whether type I IFNs results in remission in people with active ulcerative colitis, and whether it causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to August 8, 2014. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers identified six studies that included a total of 517 participants. Five studies (total 485 participants) compared type I IFNs to placebo (fake medicine) injections. One small (32 participants) low quality study compared types I IFNs to prednisolone (a steroid drug) enemas. This study did not measure remission and found no difference between the treatment groups in quality of life or disease activity scores. There was no difference between type I interferons and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who achieved remission or improvement of their symptoms. These results suggest that type I IFNs do not produce remission from ulcerative colitis. Common side effects included headaches, arthralgias (joint pain), myalgias (muscle pain), fatigue, back pain, nausea, injection site reactions, rigors (cold and shivering), and fevers.
