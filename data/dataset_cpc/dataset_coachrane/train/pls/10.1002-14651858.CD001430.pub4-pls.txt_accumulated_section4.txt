Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis
Review questionWe reviewed the evidence about the effects of corticosteroids on visual recovery of people with acute optic neuritis. 
BackgroundOptic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve leading to sudden loss of vision that takes place over the course of several hours or days. The optic nerve, which enters the back of the eye, carries visual information from the eye to the brain. When the optic nerve becomes inflamed, damage may occur. Thus information from the eye to the brain is interrupted, resulting in temporary or permanent vision loss. Optic neuritis is closely linked to multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory disease that affects nerve cells generally. Corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of optic neuritis due to their anti‚Äêinflammatory effects. 
Study characteristicsFor this systematic review, we identified six trials conducted in Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, which included 750 participants. These trials compared corticosteroid treatment with placebo or another treatment; they varied in the way corticosteroids were given and the dose. Two trials compared oral corticosteroids versus placebo; three trials compared intravenous corticosteroids versus placebo; one trial compared two types of intravenous corticosteroids; and one trial with three groups compared oral corticosteroids versus intravenous corticosteroids versus placebo. Participants in all six trials were followed up for at least three months. Outcomes of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity in the normal range and visual field were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life also was assessed and reported in one trial. The information is current as of 7 April 2015.
