Intravenous midazolam infusion for sedation of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question: For sick babies admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), how effective is midazolam, given by continuous intravenous drip, as a sedative for reducing stress, as measured by changes in behaviour and vital signs? 
Background: Proper sedation for babies undergoing uncomfortable procedures while receiving intensive care may reduce stress and avoid complications. Midazolam is a sedative that is used increasingly in NICUs. However, researchers have not systematically reviewed the evidence to see if it is effective and safe for babies in this setting. 
Study characteristics: We have selected for inclusion in this review randomised controlled trials of continuous intravenous drip of midazolam as a sedative in babies aged 28 days or younger. 
Key results: We included three clinical trials in this review. Using different scales to measure level of sedation, each study showed that midazolam was effective in providing sedation to babies. However, the validity of the sedation scales used in these studies has not been proven in babies; therefore, we cannot be certain that midazolam is, in fact, an effective sedative for babies. Moreover, one study showed that babies who received midazolam had a significantly higher risk of death or brain injury, and combined results of two studies showed that midazolam use may prolong length of stay in the NICU. 
Industry: One of the studies included in this review received support from industry, and for the other two studies, industry provided all study drugs.
