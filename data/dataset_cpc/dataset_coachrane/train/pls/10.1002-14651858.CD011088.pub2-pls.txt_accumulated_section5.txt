The safety and effectiveness of extending anticoagulant treatment for people who have been treated for blood clots 
Background 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the leg or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), or the clot travels in the blood and blocks a blood vessel in the lungs (pulmonary embolism (PE)). People with a VTE are treated with an anticoagulant, which prevents formation of further clots. For patients with a VTE that has been caused by a certain risk factor (prolonged periods of immobility, cancer, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, trauma, or blood disorder), treatment can be safely discontinued after three months. However, for patients in whom the VTE has no known cause (unprovoked), the optimal length of treatment is unknown because evidence is limited. Doctors have to decide upon extended treatment based on benefit (i.e. prevention of VTE recurrence) and risk (i.e. of bleeding) associated with treatment. This review assessed whether extended treatment was safe and effective in preventing further clots in patients with an unprovoked VTE. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We found six studies with a combined total of 3436 patients (until March 2017). Five studies compared treatment with placebo, and one study compared one type of treatment with another. Three of the five studies that used a placebo used warfarin, and two used aspirin. Combining results of the five studies showed no clear difference in the rate of further clots between patients treated with an anticoagulant and those treated with a placebo, and no clear difference in the numbers of deaths, bleeding incidents, or adverse effects such as stroke or heart attack.
