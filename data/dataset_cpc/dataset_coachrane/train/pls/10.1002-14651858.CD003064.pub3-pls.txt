Diuretics for transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)
Review question: Does diuretic treatment reduce the duration of oxygen therapy and respiratory symptoms and shorten hospital stay in term infants presenting with the clinical syndrome of transient tachypnoea of the newborn? 
Background: It is common for full‚Äêterm infants born by elective caesarean section to have laboured, rapid breathing (tachypnoea) and to require oxygen for about 48 hours. This transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) is responsible for about half of all cases of neonatal respiratory distress. Although it is transient and not usually serious, the condition requires admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, involves separation of mother and baby, and uses expensive resources. The underlying pathology of TTN is not well understood. The most commonly proposed mechanism is a delay in the resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth. Diuretic medication, including furosemide, may reduce fluid in the lungs. 
Studies characteristics: We identified two randomised controlled trials involving 100 babies that compared the effect of furosemide given orally or intravenously versus placebo or no treatment in babies of less than seven days of age, born at 37 or more weeks of gestation with TTN. No new trials were identified in the 2015 update. 
Results: Neither trial demonstrated a statistically significant impact of furosemide on transient tachypnoea of the newborn regarding duration of symptoms or length of hospitalisation. 
Conclusion: Diuretics cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available.
