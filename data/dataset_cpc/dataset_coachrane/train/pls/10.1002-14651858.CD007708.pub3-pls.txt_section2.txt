Failure to deliver the placenta after a vaginal birth is an uncommon event that can be associated with significant bleeding and even death if left untreated. The retained placenta may be detached from the uterine wall but is trapped so that it is not expelled through the cervix or non‚Äêdetached as the placenta fails to separate because of placental inhibition of uterine contractions. Conventional management involves spinal or general anaesthesia to enable introducing a hand inside the uterus to manually remove the placenta, which carries risks of infection and from the anaesthetic, and also requires special facilities. The use of uterine relaxing drugs (tocolytics), either alone or with other drugs to stimulate contractions of the uterus (uterotonics), may bring on the delivery of the placenta and avoid the need for this invasive procedure. This review included three trials that randomly assigned 175 women with the placenta remaining undelivered more than 15 minutes after delivery to either a placebo or the tocolytic nitroglycerin. Both groups received oxytocin to stimulate contractions of the uterus. Combined administration of nitroglycerin and oxytocin did not reduce the need for manual removal of placenta, blood loss, nor the incidence of severe postpartum haemorrhage. Nitroglycerin administration did not cause headache but resulted in a mild drop in blood pressure and a related increase in heart rate. Two out of the three trials had low risk of bias but this result needs confirmation in larger trials with adequate sample sizes to verify the role of nitroglycerin and other tocolytic drugs in managing different subtypes of retained placenta. The trials in this review did not specify the type of retained placenta. We have included an explanation of some of the scientific terms that are used in this review in a glossary (see Appendix 1).
