Interventions for preventing depression after stroke
Review question 
Do pharmacological, psychological, non‐invasive brain stimulation or a combination of these interventions prevent depression and improve outcomes after stroke? 
Background 
The role of interventions for preventing depression after stroke is unclear. Depression is a common and important complication of stroke that is often missed or poorly managed. Little is known about whether prevention strategies started early after stroke will reduce the risk of depression and improve recovery for those not depressed at assessment. 
Search date 
We identified trials using searches conducted on 13 August 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included trials which reported on the use of pharmacological and psychological interventions to prevent depression after stroke. Average age of participants ranged from 55 to 73 years. Trials were from Asia (3), Europe (8), North America (5), and Australia (3). 
Key results 
We included 19 trials (12 pharmacological and seven psychological) involving 1771 participants. Outcome information was available for nine pharmacological and two psychological trials, which suggested that these treatments might reduce the risk of developing depression. A smaller number of studies (eight pharmacological and five psychological studies) found no increase in death or adverse events. 
Certainty of evidence 
We rated the certainty of evidence as very low due to limitations in study design.
Conclusion 
Our ability to generalise these findings to all stroke survivors is limited due to the small proportion of survivors who were eligible to participate in these clinical trials. More well‐designed clinical trials are needed that test practical interventions for preventing depression across all stroke survivors.
