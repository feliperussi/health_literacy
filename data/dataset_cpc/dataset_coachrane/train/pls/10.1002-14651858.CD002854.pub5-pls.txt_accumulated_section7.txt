The use of vitamin E in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
Background 
Vitamin E is found in a variety of foods, including vegetable oils and fats, nuts and seeds. Some animal and non‚Äêinterventional studies have suggested it might have a role in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence has linked vitamin E with potentially serious side effects and even an increased risk of death. In this review, we looked for evidence about the effect of vitamin E on people who had either dementia due to AD or milder problems with memory or thinking (mild cognitive impairment or MCI). People with MCI have an increased risk of developing dementia. 
Included trials 
We searched for clinical trials published up to April 2016 which had randomly allocated people with dementia due to AD or with MCI to treatment with vitamin E supplements or a placebo (pretend treatment). We found three trials that investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with AD, but we could extract data from only one of these trials (304 participants). We found only one trial with 516 participants which investigated the effects of vitamin E on people with MCI. The quality of these two trials was generally good. 
Results 
Vitamin E did not reduce the number of people with MCI who developed dementia over three years. We also found no evidence that vitamin E improved cognition (e.g. learning and memory) in people with MCI or with dementia due to AD. One trial found that people with dementia due to AD who took vitamin E could manage daily activities (e.g. bathing and dressing) better than people who took placebo. There was no evidence from these trials that vitamin E caused significant harm to participants, but these types of trials are not the best way to look for harmful effects unless the effects are very common. Because all the results came from single trials, it is likely that further research could lead to different conclusions.
