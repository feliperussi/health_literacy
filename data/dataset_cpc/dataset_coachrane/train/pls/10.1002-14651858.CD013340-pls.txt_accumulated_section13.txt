Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale.
