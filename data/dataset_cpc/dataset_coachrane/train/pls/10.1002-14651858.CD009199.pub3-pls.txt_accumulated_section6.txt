Body position and intake of fluids for preventing headache after a lumbar puncture
Background 
A lumbar puncture is a medical procedure performed with a needle and syringe used to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid or to inject medications. Some people experience a side effect afterwards called post‚Äêdural puncture headache (PDPH). This can be made worse by movement, sitting or standing, and can be relieved by lying down. PDPH limits people's mobility and daily activities, as well as causing unplanned expenses for both the patient and the health institution. Doctors sometimes advise their patients to remain in bed after a lumbar puncture and to drink a lot to prevent PDPH. 
Key findings 
This is an update of the original review published in 2013. We found one new study in a search of the published literature in February 2015. This review includes 24 studies with 2996 participants. We compared different types of bed rest and extra fluids to see if they prevented PDPH after a lumbar puncture. We found low to moderate quality evidence that bed rest does not prevent the onset of headaches after lumbar puncture, regardless of the duration of rest or the body or head positions assumed by the patient. Furthermore, bed rest probably increases the chances of having PDPH. We found few data on the usefulness of extra fluids, which did not seem to prevent PDPH. 
We believe that these practices should no longer be routinely recommended to patients for the prevention of headaches after lumbar puncture since there is no evidence supporting them.
