Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, which can lead to pain in the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, and numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. CTS is more common in women and older age groups. Many people undergo surgery to treat this condition, though sometimes other non‐surgical treatments, such as splinting, are offered. Splinting involves immobilisation of the wrist with a device that is worn over the wrist, which usually leaves the fingers and thumb free to move. We searched for study reports and found 19 randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials including 1190 participants overall that assessed the safety and benefit of splinting for people with CTS. The risk of bias of studies was low in some studies and unclear or high in others. One low quality study suggests that splinting at night leads to more overall improvement in the short term when compared to no treatment, but we cannot say from the evidence whether one splint design or wearing regimen is more effective than another, nor can we say that splinting is more effective than other non‐surgical interventions for CTS (for example exercises, oral steroids). Nine trials measured adverse effects of splinting and all found either no or few participants reported discomfort or swelling due to splinting. More research is needed to find out how effective and safe splinting is for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly in the long term.
