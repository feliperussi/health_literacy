Orbital therapy for adult thyroid eye disease
Thyroid eye disease is a condition that is still not fully understood but results in inflammation of the eye and the tissues around the eye. It can cause changes in appearance (such as puffiness and redness of eyelids and conjunctiva, 'starey' eyes and misaligned eyes), discomfort, double vision and decreased vision. Orbital radiotherapy is a treatment given to reduce the inflammation and its associated changes. It is given in an outpatient setting and as the dose is divided into smaller daily doses it often involves up to 12 visits. This review included five randomised controlled trials involving 244 participants. A combined analysis of trials using our primary outcome showed that the 'risk' of success in a patient who received radiotherapy was 1.92 times that of a patient who did not receive radiotherapy. Single studies suggested that orbital radiotherapy in combination with steroids had a better outcome than steroids alone. There was no significant change in quality‐of‐life information collected in the orbital radiotherapy groups compared to the other groups. The short‐term adverse events reported in the trials were mild and localised to the area of treatment (redness of skin and temporal hair loss). However, trial methodology may have led to a decreased rate of adverse events from radiotherapy. Three trials excluded diabetic patients and these patients have been reported, in the literature, to be at higher risk of developing radiation retinopathy and of having progression of pre‐existing diabetic retinopathy. Some studies did not report on retinal changes at all.
