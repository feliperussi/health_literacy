Breathing support via a mask during exercise training for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Background: Quality of life and exercise tolerance are commonly reduced in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, physical activity levels are lower compared with those of healthy people of a similar age. Exercise training as a part of a formal rehabilitation programme is an important component of management for people with COPD and has been shown to improve both quality of life and exercise tolerance. However, some individuals may have difficulty performing exercise at an adequate training intensity. Non‚Äêinvasive ventilation (NIV) is a method of providing breathing support using a machine called a ventilator. Breathing support is delivered via a mask that is worn over the nose, mouth or both, or via a mouthpiece. During a single exercise session, NIV has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and reduce breathlessness. Consequently, NIV used over multiple exercise sessions (during exercise training) may allow people with COPD to exercise at a higher intensity and potentially to achieve greater improvement in exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity. 
Review question: We conducted a review to determine whether NIV during exercise training affects exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV (placebo) in people with COPD. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to November 2013. We included six studies involving 126 participants who completed the study protocols. Most studies recruited participants with severe to very severe COPD. The average age of participants ranged from 63 to 71 years. Cycling or treadmill exercise training was performed in the studies. The duration of exercise training programmes ranged from six to twelve weeks.
