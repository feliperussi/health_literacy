Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers during percutaneous coronary intervention and as the initial treatment of acute coronary syndromes 
During the last two decades, doctors have been looking for the best treatment to prevent clots in the coronary arteries of patients with coronary heart disease. This review summarises the results of 60 studies which used a potent class of intravenous antiplatelet drugs ‐ glycoprotein IIb‐IIIa blockers ‐ in 66,689 participants. This treatment was tested in two different conditions: in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty (inserting a deflated small balloon in the artery and expand it to open the vessel) with or without inserting a stent (a thin metal expandable tube or sleeve to scaffold the artery open); and as the initial treatment of patients hospitalised for unstable angina and non‐ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (prolonged coronary chest pain with or without small myocardial infarction). The evidence is up to date as January 2013 and the overall quality of the body of evidence was good. 
Overall, the use of these drugs during coronary angioplasty with or without inserting a stent reduced the risk of death at 30 days, and the risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days and at six months. The results were similar for stable and for unstable patients with coronary artery disease, but there was comparatively less benefit for patients previously treated with clopidogrel, an oral antiplatelet drug. On the other side, these drugs only slightly reduced the risk of death or myocardial infarction when administered as initial medical treatment in patients with unstable angina or non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction. The benefits of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers need to be balanced against the increased risk of bleeding.
