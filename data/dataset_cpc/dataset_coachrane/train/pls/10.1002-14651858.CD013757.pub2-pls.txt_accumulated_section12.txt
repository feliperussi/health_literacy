Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease.

Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.
