Ovarian function suppression for treating premenopausal women with hormone receptor‐positive early breast cancer 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether adding ovarian function suppression to treatment for early breast cancer improves survival, reduces the risk of cancer coming back, and is safe for premenopausal women with hormone receptor‐positive early breast cancer. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer these questions and found 15 studies. 
Key messages? 
Adding ovarian suppression function to therapy improved survival (women lived longer) and reduced the chance of cancer returning in women with operable early breast cancer, but the use of ovarian function suppression appears to increase the risk of hot flushes and may affect bone health. The decision to use OFS needs to be personalised after the risk and benefit profile is considered. 
What was studied in the review? 
Around eight out of ten premenopausal women who develop breast cancer have a type of cancer that is sensitive to hormones, termed 'hormone receptor‐positive' disease. To slow the growth of any cancer cells that remain after surgery, hormonal therapy can be used to reduce the availability of natural hormone oestrogen to cancer cells. This can be done by blocking oestrogen receptors on the cells with drugs such as tamoxifen, by suppressing the production of oestrogen by drugs called luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, or by removing the ovaries with surgery or impairing their ability to produce hormones using radiotherapy. 
This review examined the role of ovarian function suppression (i.e. LHRH agonists, removal of the ovaries, or radiation‐induced ovarian suppression) for premenopausal women with hormone receptor‐positive early‐stage breast cancer. The practice of suppressing ovarian function in addition to providing other treatments has been of interest over the last five years, as new data from clinical trials have become available. A review of these data is needed to find the benefits of adding ovarian function suppression to treatment, to identify side effects from ovarian function suppression, and to discover how treatment is affecting a woman's overall well‐being (quality of life). 
The funding source for the conduct of these studies was government (four studies), government and pharmaceutical companies combined (three studies), government and not‐for‐profit organisations combined (two studies), not‐for‐profit organisations and pharmaceutical companies (two studies), and a pharmaceutical company (one study); three studies did not report a funding source. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Review authors found 15 relevant studies involving 11,538 women. To achieve ovarian function suppression, nine studies used LHRH agonists (most used goserelin), two studies induced ovarian function suppression through surgery, and four studies allowed any method (LHRH agonists, surgery, or radiotherapy). LHRH agonists were given to women for a minimum of one year. 
The woman's health was monitored for at least two years from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for over 12 years. 
Review authors found that adding ovarian suppression function to treatment:
• improves survival and reduces the risk of cancer coming back compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression; 
• appears to increase the chance of severe hot flushes compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression; 
• probably reduces the risk of a second breast cancer in the other breast compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression; 
• may or may not have an effect on mood (e.g. anxiety, depression) compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression; 
• may increase the risk of osteoporosis compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression (however, this finding was based on one study); and 
• may make little or no difference in quality of life for women compared to treatment without ovarian function suppression. Five of 15 studies provided some information on the quality of life of women.
