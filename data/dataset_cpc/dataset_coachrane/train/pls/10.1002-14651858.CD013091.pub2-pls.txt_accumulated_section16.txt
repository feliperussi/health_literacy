Reduced breast density following endocrine therapy as an indicator of breast cancer risk 
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is a common cancer and cause of death in women worldwide. Treatment options for breast cancer include endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy can also be used to prevent breast cancer for women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer. It would help doctors and their patients to understand whether some patients are likely to have greater benefit from endocrine therapy than others. The structure of the breast is likely to change following endocrine therapy. These structural changes are seen when women have a mammogram (breast x‐ray). They appear as a decrease in the area of white tissue (breast density) on the mammogram. We wanted to find out whether reductions in breast density after endocrine therapy can help to determine how well endocrine therapy works. 
Review question 
We searched for previously published studies. We assessed whether a reduction in breast density after receiving endocrine therapy was associated with better outcomes. For women without breast cancer, this focused on whether those with decreased breast density were less likely to develop breast cancer. For women with breast cancer, this included whether those with greater decreases in breast density were less likely to die from breast cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We performed the search on 3 August 2020. We included studies of adult women with breast cancer if the women's breast cancer had been diagnosed at an early stage and could be treated with endocrine therapy (hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer). We included drugs often used in practice (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors). We found a wide variety of studies. The studies varied in terms of how they had been planned and the characteristics of the women included in the studies, as well as in how breast density change was measured. 
Key results 
Most studies reported a reduced risk of breast cancer after endocrine therapy for women who had a breast density reduction compared with women who did not have a reduction. There was slightly stronger evidence for the drug tamoxifen. 
• Two studies reported on breast density reduction following tamoxifen and risk of breast cancer death. The findings were based on 172 women who died from breast cancer. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low. 
• Two studies considered if breast cancer returned after treatment with tamoxifen. There were concerns about the study methods and certainty of findings in these two studies. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
• One study considered treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and the chance of breast cancer returning. There was considerable uncertainty about the effect size because there were only 175 women in the study. The certainty of the evidence was very low due to potential risk of bias in the study. 
• One study considered if breast cancer returned locally or at a distance from the original tumour. There was risk of bias in reporting and uncertainty about the sizes of the effect. The certainty of the evidence for both outcomes was very low. 
• Two studies looked at the chance of women with breast cancer being diagnosed later with a new breast cancer, such as in the opposite breast. There was risk of bias in reporting and uncertainty about the size of the effect. The certainty of the evidence was very low. 
• One study considered women who had not previously had breast cancer and who received tamoxifen. Results were based on 51 women who developed breast cancer. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low. 
• One study considered whether the beneficial effect of tamoxifen could be explained by a decrease in breast density. There was some evidence to support this, but there was uncertainty about the strength of the effect. The results were based on 51 women who developed breast cancer after receiving tamoxifen. The certainty of the evidence was low.
