What are the benefits and harms of physical activity for people with irritable bowel syndrome 
Key messages 
– Physical activity interventions of between six and 24 weeks may improve symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome but the evidence is very uncertain.  
– There is probably little or no difference between physical activity interventions and usual care for quality of life and abdominal pain. 
– There was not enough evidence to assess adverse effects associated with physical activity interventions due to a lack of reporting in trials. 
What are physical activity interventions? 
Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by your muscles that results in energy expenditure. Examples of physical activity include activity performed as part of daily life (housework, shopping), sport and recreational activity, and activity performed as part of work (e.g. travelling to work, manual labour). 
Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured and repetitive, and has the aim of improving or maintaining overall fitness. Stretching and activities to improve balance are also considered forms of physical activity and exercise. 
The UK Department of Health and Social Care currently recommends that adults participate in a minimum of 30 minutes of daily physical activity at least five days a week. 
There is strong evidence that physical activity and exercise interventions are effective in helping people prevent and manage long‐term health conditions including coronary heart disease (narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the heart), diabetes and depression. Whether physical activity helps people diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome manage their symptoms is not clear.
