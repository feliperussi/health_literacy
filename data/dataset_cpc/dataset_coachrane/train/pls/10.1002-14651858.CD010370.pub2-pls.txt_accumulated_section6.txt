Total or near‐total thyroidectomy versus subtotal thyroidectomy for multinodular non‐toxic goitre in adults 
Review question 
What are the effects of total or near‐total thyroidectomy compared with subtotal thyroidectomy for multinodular non‐toxic goitre in adults? 
Background 
Multinodular goitre refers to a generalised enlarged thyroid gland with recognisable nodules within it. The thyroid gland consists of two connected lobes. People affected by goitre often present with a non‐symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid gland with a visible swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck. One or more nodules can be recognised. The most frequent cause of multinodular goitre is iodine deficiency. Non‐toxic goitre means that the nodules do not secret thyroid hormones in an uncontrolled way. Total thyroidectomy is an operation that involves the surgical removal of the whole thyroid gland. Near‐total thyroidectomy is an operation that involves the surgical removal of both thyroid lobes except for a small amount of thyroid tissue (on one or both sides less than 1.0 mL). Subtotal thyroidectomy leaves 3 g to 5 g on the less affected side of the thyroid gland. 
After thyroidectomy one of the most important complications is recurrent nerve palsy because this nerve might be traumatised during the surgery. A wide spectrum of complications to the voice, swallowing mechanisms, or both, can occur. A temporary or permanent voice change can result. If the goitre reappears (goitre recurrence) some time after thyroidectomy, another surgical intervention might be necessary. This surgery is more complicated than the initial surgery because of scar tissue making it difficult to identify nerves and other important tissues. There is also the possibility that subtotal thyroidectomy, which is thought to be somewhat safer than total thyroidectomy, may leave an undetected thyroid cancer in place.
