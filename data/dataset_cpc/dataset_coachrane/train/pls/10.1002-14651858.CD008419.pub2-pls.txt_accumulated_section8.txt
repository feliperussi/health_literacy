Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease or syndrome
Background 
Ménière's disease is a disorder of the inner ear, which results in vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. When it is secondary to another known inner ear disorder, it is called Ménière's syndrome. A number of different treatments have been used for patients with this disease, ranging from dietary measures (e.g. a low‐salt diet) and medication (e.g. betahistine or diuretics) to extensive surgery. However, Ménière's disease has a fluctuating natural course with remissions and exacerbations, which makes the evaluation of treatments difficult. 
Positive pressure therapy uses a device (such as the Meniett®) placed in the external ear to generate a sequence of low‐pressure (micro‐pressure) pulses. These pulses are thought to be transmitted to the vestibular system of the inner ear and to influence inner ear pressure. The device has been proposed as a second‐level therapy for Ménière's disease. In order to use the device a patient needs to have a tympanostomy tube (grommet) inserted through their eardrum. 
Study characteristics 
In this review, we included five randomised controlled trials, with a total of 265 participants. All participants had Ménière's disease and their ages ranged from 19 to 74 years. In all of the studies positive pressure therapy was compared with a placebo device. 
Key results 
For our primary outcome, control of vertigo, we could not combine the results from the different studies because of differences in the way the outcome was measured. None of the included studies showed significant differences between the active groups and placebo groups in terms of vertigo days. Only one study found significantly lower subjective scores for vertigo in favour of the positive pressure therapy group when compared to the placebo group.
