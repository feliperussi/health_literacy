Ovarian cyst aspiration and IVF outcomes
Review question 
Cochrane authors investigated the effectiveness and safety of cyst aspiration before ovarian stimulation versus a conservative approach (no aspiration) in women undergoing In vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Our primary outcomes were live birth rate and adverse events. We also assessed pregnancy rates, number of follicles recruited, and number of oocytes retrieved. 
Background 
IVF is a treatment for infertility in which a woman's eggs (oocytes) are fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish. One or more of the fertilized eggs (embryos) are then transferred into the woman's uterus, where it is hoped the egg will implant and result in a pregnancy. 
The woman's ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs which are then retrieved for fertilization by sperm. This differs from what usually occurs, when one egg is produced by the ovary. Stimulation of the ovaries is achieved by a woman taking several different drugs to maximise the chance of getting several eggs suitable for fertilization. Prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) a baseline ultrasound is performed to detect the presence of any functional ovarian cysts. The evidence on the effect of draining such an ovarian cyst on the end result of IVF was examined in this review. 
Study characteristics 
Three randomized controlled trials were included involving 339 women of reproductive age who required IVF treatment due to tubal factor infertility, anovulation, male factor infertility, endometriosis or fertility of unknown cause. These studies compared the outcome of IVF cycles in women whose cyst was drained versus the outcomes when the cyst was not drained. The evidence was current to April 2014.
