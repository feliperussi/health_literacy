Education and training for preventing sharps injuries and splash exposures in healthcare workers 
What is the aim of this review? 
Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of experiencing a sharps injury or being splashed with blood or other bodily fluids whilst delivering care to their patients, which puts them at risk of developing infectious diseases. This review is part of a series investigating interventions for the prevention of such injuries, more specifically, the effectiveness of education and training interventions in reducing the occurrence of these injuries. We comprehensively searched multiple databases to find randomized and non‐randomized studies that utilized educational intervention for preventing sharps and splash exposure. 
Key messages 
We found low to very low quality evidence that education and training may prevent sharps injuries in HCWs up to twelve months follow‐up. Future research using high‐quality randomized study designs is required to further investigate the effects of education and training on the incidence of sharps injuries and splash exposures in HCWs. 
What was studied in the review? 
A total of seven studies were included in this review; one cluster‐RCT, three controlled clinical trials and three interrupted time series. All included studies except two utilized a combination of educational presentations, interactive demonstrations, and marketing tools. The risk of bias was high in all of the seven included studies. Only one more recently published study applied the preferred study design of a cluster‐randomized trial. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Education and training interventions for HCWs may lead to small reductions in the rate of sharps injuries. Education may create short‐term improvements in knowledge and behaviors related to sharps injuries. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
Searches were conducted up to April 2020.
