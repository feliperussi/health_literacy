What is the best treatment for itch in people with chronic kidney disease?
What is the issue? Itch (medical term pruritus) is a common problem for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Itch can greatly affect quality of life and may lead to depression or increased risk of death. There are no widely used or agreed upon treatment guidelines for itch associated with CKD. 
What did we do? We found 92 studies involving 4466 people investigating 30 treatments for CKD‐associated itch. The control treatment was either placebo or (less commonly) another treatment for CKD‐associated itch. 
What did we find? One type of drug (gabapentin and pregabalin), an analogue to a common neurotransmitter appear to reduce itch in patients with CKD. Ondansetron, an anti‐nausea drug, was another well studied treatment and appears have no significant association with itch reduction. Kappa‐opioid drugs (nalfurafine) appear to slightly reduce itch. There is too little information on the remaining treatments for any thorough assessment of their efficacy in relieving itch or whether there is any anti‐itch effect at all. 
The three drugs mentioned above are well studied with higher quality evidence. The other treatments studied are of lower to moderate quality. 
The studies seldom document a comprehensive list of adverse or side effects incurred during treatment. However, none of the adverse effects documented were severe. Further meaningful assessment on harm cannot be made. 
Conclusions Drugs that work like neurotransmitters (gabapentin and pregabalin) reduce itch in patients with CKD. Other intervention either do not work, do not work as well, or need further study to make a conclusion.
