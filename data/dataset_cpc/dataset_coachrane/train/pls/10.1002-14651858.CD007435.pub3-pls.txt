Coenzyme Q10 for High Blood Pressure
Background 
High blood pressure is a common condition that can increase risk for certain diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and kidney disease. Coenzyme Q10, a non‐prescription nutritional supplement, has been suggested as a potential drug to lower blood pressure. When this review was completed and published in October 2009, it concluded that "due to the possible unreliability of the three included studies, it is uncertain whether or not coenzyme Q10 reduces blood pressure in the long‐term management of primary hypertension." 
Review Question 
We asked whether coenzyme Q10 compared to a placebo affected blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure. 
Study Characteristics 
For this update, databases of registered clinical trials and published trial reports were searched up until 10 November 2015 for any studies that tested the effects of coenzyme Q10 on patients' blood pressure. One new trial was found and one trial in the initial review was excluded. These studies measured the effects of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure in non‐hospitalized men and women who took the drugs for 8 to 12 weeks. One of the three trials was judged to have an unacceptably high risk of bias and was not included in the pooled analysis. The total number of patients studied in the two pooled trials was 50. 
Key Results 
Pooled data from two trials showed that coenzyme Q10 did not affect blood pressure compared to placebo. The number of patients stopping the drug due to adverse effects was also an outcome of interest. In one of the three included trials, coenzyme Q10 was well‐tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. 
Quality of the Evidence 
This review provides moderate‐quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 does not lower blood pressure. However, more well‐conducted studies are needed to be sure.
