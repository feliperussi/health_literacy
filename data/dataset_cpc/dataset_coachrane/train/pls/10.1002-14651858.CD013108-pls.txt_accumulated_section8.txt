Surgery for women with pelvic organ prolapse with or without continence procedures
Review question 
To assess the outcomes of operations for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) with or without operations to treat or prevent stress urinary incontinence (SUI).  Background 
Pelvic organ prolapse is a common condition, especially among women who have given birth and who are postmenopausal. It involves the descent of pelvic organs such as the womb (uterus), bladder, bowel, and vagina within and outside of the vaginal opening. It is often associated with urinary leakage on coughing or physical exertion as in sports (termed 'stress urinary incontinence'). However, in some women, the prolapse prevents leakage from the urethra and stress urinary incontinence might be present only with re‚Äêplacement of the prolapsed organs in the vagina during vaginal examination (termed 'occult SUI'). Stress urinary incontinence may also develop only after surgical treatment of prolapse (termed 'de novo SUI'). To date, the best treatment for women undergoing surgery for symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse with and without incontinence conditions is not known. 
Study characteristics 
Cochrane review authors searched different registers for relevant studies and collected, summarised, and analysed appropriate data to help identify the optimal treatment. Data are current to December 2017. 
Key results 
Reviewers included 19 randomised controlled trials in this review (2717 women), including surgical operations for POP with or without continence procedures in continent or incontinent women. Our primary outcome was subjective postoperative SUI. Secondary outcomes included recurrent POP on examination, overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, voiding dysfunction, and need for further surgery.
