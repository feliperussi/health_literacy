Nutrition education to support weaning of term‐born infants
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for effects of nutrition education about appropriate feeding practices during weaning on growth and development in children born at term gestation. 
Background 
Around the world, over 150 million children are undernourished and over 42 million are overweight and obese. Providing families with appropriate education about feeding practices during weaning may help to optimise nutrition while helping to protect children who are at risk of undernutrition, as well as those susceptible to being overweight and obese. 
Study characteristics 
We examined research published up to December 2019 and found 21 clinical trials recruiting 14,241 babies. The nutrition education provided in all included studies, whereby analysis could be pooled together, was aimed at reducing the risk of undernutrition in childhood. Five studies were undertaken in high‐income countries, but the findings reported could not be included and pooled together in this review. 
Key results 
We found that giving nutrition education about appropriate feeding practices during weaning to families in low‐ to moderate‐income settings may improve weight and height at 12 months of age. We are very uncertain about the effects of nutrition education on children's development and risk of anaemia at one year of age, as only two studies reported each of these outcomes. Therefore, these results are described only in the text. We did not find any studies that assessed the effects of nutrition education on children's risk of overweight and obesity and reported outcomes that could be pooled together in this review.
