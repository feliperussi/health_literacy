Fish oil for preventing blockage of haemodialysis vascular access in patients with kidney failure 
What is the issue? 
Patients requiring long‐term haemodialysis (HD) because of poorly functioning kidneys need a reliable and efficient method of circulating blood at high flow rates between their bodies and the HD machine. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are the two main methods of achieving such long‐term vascular access. An AVF is a surgically constructed direct connection (fistula) between a patient's artery and vein. An AVG is a synthetic flexible hollow tubing (graft) that indirectly connects a patient's artery and vein and is usually used when a fistula cannot be created. During HD, the fistula or graft is pierced by needles (cannulated) connected to the dialysis machine. The patency of these artificial connections may be blocked by blood clots (thrombosis) or by a narrowing (stenosis) of the vein. The risk of this occurring is lower for AVFs, making it the method of choice. When a blockage does occur, HD cannot be performed and surgical or radiological salvage procedures will be urgently required. Omega‐3 fatty acid fish oils can reduce blood viscosity and might conceivably reduce the risk of blood clots and blood vessel narrowing, hence improving long‐term vascular access and quality of HD. 
What did we do? 
We collected data from studies that tested HD patients with supplements of omega‐3 fatty acid fish oils against placebo and that reported results for preventing vascular access blockage and for the following side‐effects ‐ death, hospitalisation, cardiovascular events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, gastrointestinal events, and other adverse events. We analysed and reported the results separately for patients with AVFs and AVGs.
