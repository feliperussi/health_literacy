Vaccines for preventing infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis to prevent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease where thick mucus is produced in the lungs. This can stop the lungs clearing bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria. This causes long‚Äêlasting lung infections in approximately 80% of adult patients; these infections result in permanent lung damage. 
Vaccines have been developed which aim to reduce infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it is important to know whether using these vaccines can prevent lung infection. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 30 March 2015.
Study characteristics 
We searched for vaccine trials where cystic fibrosis patients were selected at random to receive either an active vaccine or no vaccine (or a placebo, which is a dummy vaccine with no active medication). We also looked for trials comparing different types of vaccine or different schedules or doses of the same vaccine. We included three trials; two compared a Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine to a placebo and the third compared a vaccine to no vaccine. The two trials comparing a vaccine to placebo had 959 cystic fibrosis patients (483 in one and 476 in the other); the third trial recruited 37 patients with cystic fibrosis. The average age of the patients was about seven years in all three trials. All of the patients were free of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the start of the trials and had a lung function of at least 50% of predicted for age. The two large trials followed the patients for two and four years, respectively; the small trial followed the patients for between 10 and 12 years.
