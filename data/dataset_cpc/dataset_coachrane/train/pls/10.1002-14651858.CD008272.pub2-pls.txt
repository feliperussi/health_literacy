When is the best time to start antiretroviral therapy in people with HIV infection, who have not received antiretroviral treatment before and who do not have any symptoms of HIV illness? 
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to be effective in slowing down the progression of AIDS and in reducing HIV‐related illnesses and death. Traditionally, therapy is administered based on a patient’s CD4 cell count, where the number of CD4 cells reflects the body’s immune (defense) system.  An HIV‐infected individual with a CD4 cell count of 500 cells/µL is considered healthy enough not to need ART. When a patient’s cell count reaches 200 cells/ µL, however, the immune system is severely weakened and ART is necessary. A patient with advanced symptoms receives treatment regardless of CD4 count. 
Recommendations on the timing for ART initiation differ based on availability of resources, leading to confusion amongst clinicians and policy‐makers in determining the most favorable point to begin treatment. The objective of this review is to assess the evidence for the optimal time to initiate ART in HIV‐infected adults who have not previously received therapy and who do not have symptoms of HIV illness.   
The authors reviewed two trials which involved 1,065 participants. Both studies compared the effect of ART initiation at high CD4 counts (350 cells/µL) with ART initiation at low CD4 counts (250 cells/µL). Results showed that starting ART at higher levels of CD4 reduces mortality rates in HIV‐infected individuals who have not received antiretroviral treatment before and who do not have any symptoms of HIV illness.
