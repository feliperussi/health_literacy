Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis
Background 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep vein of the leg or pelvis. It affects approximately 1 in 1000 people. If it is not treated, the clot can travel in the blood, and block the arteries in the lungs. This life‐threatening condition is called a pulmonary embolism and occurs in approximately 3 to 4 in 10,000 people. Another side‐effect of DVT is post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a condition in which the patient suffers pain, swelling, and changes in the skin of the leg, which can lead to an ulcer. This causes significant disability and diminished qualify of life, and is costly to the healthcare system. 
One way to prevent another blood clot or PTS is to remove the clot. There are a number of ways to do this. A catheter can be inserted into the vein and the clot removed directly (mechanical thrombectomy), the clot can be broken down through the use of drugs infused into a vein in the foot or directly at the site of the clot using a catheter and X‐ray control (pharmacomechanical thrombolysis), or a combination of the two procedures. This review aimed to measure how safe and effective pharmacomechanical thrombectomy is, compared to other techniques. 
Key results 
There were no randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria of this review (current until December 2015). We identified one ongoing study. 
Quality of evidence 
At present, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials that examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy in the management of patients with DVT.
