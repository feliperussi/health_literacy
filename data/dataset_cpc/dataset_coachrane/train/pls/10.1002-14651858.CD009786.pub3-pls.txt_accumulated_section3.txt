Laparoscopy in diagnosing extensiveness of ovarian cancer
Why is improving the diagnosis of extensiveness of ovarian cancer important?  Ovarian cancer is a disease with a high‐mortality (death) rate. Many women (75%) are diagnosed when their disease is already at an advanced stage and 140,000 women die of this disease each year worldwide. Treatment consist of debulking surgery (removal of as much of the tumour as possible during an operation called a laparotomy ‐ normally through a long vertical cut on the abdomen) and six cycles of chemotherapy. The order in which these two treatments are given depends on the extensiveness of disease (how widespread) and on the general health of the patient. The goal of debulking surgery is to remove all visible tumour or at least to leave no residual tumour deposit bigger than 1 cm in diameter. When the diagnostic evaluation suggests that the goal of debulking surgery could not be achieved, initial treatment may be three cycles of chemotherapy to first shrink the tumour, followed by debulking surgery and then further chemotherapy to complete the course of six cycles of chemotherapy.  To diagnose the extensiveness of disease by physical examination, ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography (CT scan), and measurement of serum tumour(blood) markers are performed. An incorrect diagnosis could result in women having unsuccessful primary debulking surgery. 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to investigate if laparoscopy (keyhole surgery to look inside the abdominal cavity) is accurate in predicting whether a women can be successfully operated to remove of all visible tumour or at least to leave no tumour deposits larger than 1 cm. If so, this could help to avoid operating on those women who would be better treated with chemotherapy first.
