Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease or GORD is a condition which develops when stomach contents regurgitate into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms such as heartburn (burning sensation at the lower end of the breastbone) or regurgitation (perception of flow of stomach content into the throat or mouth). Long‐term complications of GORD include reflux oesophagitis (injury to lining of oesophagus), bleeding from the oesophagus, narrowing of the oesophagus, change in the nature of the lining of the oesophagus which can sometimes give rise to oesophageal cancer. Approximately 3% to 33% of people have GORD around the world. The risk factors for GORD include a family history of reflux disease in immediate relatives, pregnancy, older age, obesity, cigarette smoking, and excessive alcohol drinking. Apart from lifestyle changes (such as cessation of smoking) and diet changes (avoiding food that causes heartburn), the major forms of treatment for GORD are medical and surgical. The medical treatment is usually aimed at decreasing acidity in the stomach. Currently a group of drugs which suppress acid secretion, called proton pump inhibitors, are considered the best in decreasing acid secretion. The main surgical treatment is fundoplication which involves wrapping around the lower part of the food pipe with stomach. This can be performed by traditional open surgery, keyhole surgery or surgery that is performed without making any cut from within the stomach with the help of an endoscope (in this context, a flexible tube introduced through the mouth to give a view of the food pipe and stomach). The benefits and harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to medical treatment in people with GORD is not known. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all studies whose results were reported until 1st October 2014.
