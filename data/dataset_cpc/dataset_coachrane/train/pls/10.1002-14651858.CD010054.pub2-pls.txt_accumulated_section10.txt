Is the blood pressure‐lowering effect of beta‐blockers with partial agonist activity consistent or variable throughout the day? 
Review question 
This review explores whether the blood pressure‐lowering effect of beta‐blockers with partial agonist activity is consistent or variable throughout the day in adults with high blood pressure (upper blood pressure reading of at least 140 mmHg, or lower blood pressure reading of at least 90 mmHg, or both). 
Background 
High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is very common in the general population, and if not treated, can increase the risk of stroke and heart disease. In an individual, blood pressure naturally varies throughout the day. It is at its lowest at night, rises before awakening, and then falls progressively during the day. Changes to this pattern of variation have been found to be a risk factor for heart disease, independent of the degree of rise in blood pressure. 
Beta‐blockers are commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure. Currently, we do not know whether beta‐blockers lower blood pressure to different degrees at different times of the day, and how this differs when compared to other classes of drugs used to treat high blood pressure. This review focused on a particular class of beta‐blockers – those with partial agonist activity (molecules that both activate and inhibit its receptor). 
Search date 
We searched the available scientific literature, and included relevant studies up to June 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We sought studies that examined the blood pressure‐lowering effects of treatment with six beta‐blockers with partial agonist activity at different times throughout a 24‐hour period, measured by a device that automatically measures blood pressure at regular intervals (ambulatory monitoring).
