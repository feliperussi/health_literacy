Which drug is best for treating excessive bleeding after childbirth?
What is the issue?The most common reason why mothers die during childbirth is excessive bleeding, which is known as postpartum haemorrhage, when blood loss equals or exceeds 500 mL. This emergency condition is usually caused by failure of the uterus to contract and close the vessels that carried blood to the placenta. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends giving drugs that make the uterus contract more effectively (uterotonic drugs) and reduce the risk for excessive bleeding. Although these drugs are given to the mother immediately after the birth of her baby, some women will still experience heavy bleeding and will require further treatment. 
Why is this important?The administration of uterotonic drugs is the main treatment when prevention fails, and excessive bleeding occurs. Available uterotonic treatments include oxytocin, carbetocin, ergometrine, misoprostol, injectable prostaglandins, and combinations of these drugs, which differ in terms of effectiveness and side‐effects. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to identify the best drug with the least side‐effects for treating excessive bleeding after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find?We searched for evidence in May 2020 and found seven studies involving 3738 women. Women gave birth mostly vaginally in hospital settings and had received uterotonic drugs to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. The drugs used for treating heavy bleeding in these studies were misoprostol (tablets dissolved under the tongue, pills or rectal suppositories), oxytocin (given into a vein or muscle), a combination of misoprostol with oxytocin and a combination of Syntometrine® (ergometrine plus oxytocin combination injected into muscle) with oxytocin.
