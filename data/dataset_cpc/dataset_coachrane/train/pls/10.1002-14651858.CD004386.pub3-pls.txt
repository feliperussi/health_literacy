Antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections due to chemotherapy in cancer patients with a low white blood cell count and no fever 
For patients receiving chemotherapy, there is an increased risk of infection due to a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) caused by a toxic effect of chemotherapy on the bone marrow. The objective of this review was to establish whether preventive antibiotic therapy (prophylaxis) before the development of fever prevents illness and death in people with a low white blood cell count after chemotherapy and to assess whether certain types of antibiotics are better than others. We included 109 randomised controlled trials conducted between the years 1973 to 2010. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased the risk of death when compared to no intervention. We estimated that the number of patients needed to be treated with antibiotics in order to prevent one death from all causes was 34. Antibiotic prophylaxis also decreased the risk of death from infection and the risk of development of fever. Â Although antibiotic prophylaxis may be associated with unfavourable effects and may encourage new and more resistant infection, this was not shown in existing trials. Recent studies used antibiotics of the quinolone class, which showed fewer adverse events and better outcomes than other classes of antibiotics. 
Most studies were limited to haematological cancer patients (mostly leukaemia).
In conclusion, patients with a low white blood count following chemotherapy who received preventive antibiotic treatment in the absence of fever had a reduced risk of dying. This was shown mainly for haematological cancer patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis, preferably from the quinolone class of antibiotics, should be recommended for routine use in these patients.
