Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with atrial fibrillation
Background 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common irregular heart beat a person can experience. It affects the heart by 'taking over' and sending out electric pulses that makes the heartbeat irregular and inefficient. Symptoms can include irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, and fainting. Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore health in people with atrial fibrillation or those who have been treated for atrial fibrillation, through regular exercise. 
Review question 
This systematic review assessed the benefits and harms of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with atrial fibrillation. 
Study characteristics 
We included six randomised trials with a total of 421 participants. The evidence is current to July 2016. 
Key results 
There were two deaths and eight serious adverse events (harmful side effects) reported in the six trials, therefore, we had insufficient data to conclude whether exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation improved outcomes that matter the most to patients, such as death and serious adverse events (e.g. hospitalisation). Exercise‐based rehabilitation was not found to have a clinically relevant impact on quality of life for the patient group, but may increase exercise capacity. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low for all outcomes. It was possible for people in the trials to know to which intervention group they were randomised, the reporting of the results was not complete in many trials, and for some outcomes, the results varied across trials. These considerations limit our confidence in the overall results of the review.
