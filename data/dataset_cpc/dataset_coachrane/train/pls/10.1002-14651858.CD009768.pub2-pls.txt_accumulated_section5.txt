Mesenchymal stromal cells to treat or prevent graft‐versus‐host disease in stem cell transplant recipients 
Review question 
In people who receive a stem cell transplant for a haematological condition, can an additional infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) prevent the development of graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD)? In people who have already developed GvHD as a result of their stem cell transplant, can MSCs improve their clinical outcome? 
Background 
Patients with leukaemia or other blood disorders may be treated with blood stem cells from another person, but the immune cells in the graft can attack their tissues in a serious complication referred to as graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD). Steroids are the standard treatment for GvHD, but if they are unable stop the damage then treatment options are limited. In order to look for potential new treatments, a number of hospitals around the world have investigated the use of MSCs for inhibiting GvHD. MSCs are a type of cell that can develop into connective tissue (e.g. bone or cartilage), but they have also been found to have anti‐inflammatory properties. For clinical trials, MSCs have been isolated from different tissue sources (e.g. bone marrow, fat, or umbilical cords) and then grown in large numbers in the laboratory. The MSC preparations are then injected intravenously into the patient at the time they have their stem cell transplant or afterward, either to prevent GvHD (prophylaxis) or to treat ongoing disease. For patients being treated for GvHD, is treatment with MSCs safe and effective against complications of inflammation associated with GvHD?
