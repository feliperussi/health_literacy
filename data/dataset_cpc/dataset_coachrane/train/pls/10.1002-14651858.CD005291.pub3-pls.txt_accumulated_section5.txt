Preimplantation genetic testing for abnormal chromosome numbers for couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation 
Review question 
Does preimplantation genetic testing for abnormal chromosome numbers improve the chances of a pregnancy followed by a live‐born baby? 
Background 
In in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the selection of the best embryo(s) for transfer is mainly based on morphological assessment of the embryos, which includes the number of cells, the regularity of cells, and the presence of cell fragments. Unfortunately, almost two‐thirds of couples do not get pregnant even after transfer of ‘good quality’ embryos. One of the presumed causes is that such embryos have an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy). Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT‐A) is a technique used to analyse the number of chromosomes present in IVF embryos. In PGT‐A, a polar body (a waste product of maternal meiosis),or one or a few cells of the embryo are obtained by biopsy and tested. Only polar bodies or embryos with a normal number of chromosomes in each cell, so‐called 'euploid embryos', are transferred into the uterus. The idea is that this will increase the live birth rate per started IVF cycle. Previous studies on PGT‐A that used a genetic analysis technique called fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) found PGT‐A to be ineffective in improving live birth rates. Since then, new methodologies and techniques in PGT‐A have been developed that perform the procedure on polar bodies or other stages of embryo development and use different methods of genetic analysis (array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) or next‐generation sequencing (NGS)).
