Banked preterm versus banked term human milk to promote growth and development in very low birth weight infants 
Review questionWhen mother's own milk is not available or is insufficient, does feeding banked donor preterm milk compared to banked donor term milk result in improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcome in very low birthweight infants? 
BackgroundDonor‐expressed milk processed by human milk banks has been used to provide preterm infants with breast milk when there are circumstances that preclude the use of mother's own milk. Preterm milk differs significantly from term breast milk. The processes involved in providing donor milk, including freezing, thawing and pasteurisation has adverse effects on nutritional and non‐nutritional aspects of donor milk. Donor milk is expensive. We wished to determine whether the benefits of preterm donor milk were superior to term donor milk either as a sole diet, or as a supplement to mother's own milk. 
Study characteristicsWe were unable to identify any studies that compared donor preterm milk with donor term milk to promote growth and development in very low birth weight infants. Evidence is up to date as of October 2018. 
Key resultsWe were unable to conclude that donor preterm milk was superior to term donor milk as there is no evidence to support or refute this question. However the lack of studies identified in the original review and now updated in this review means that it is extremely unlikely that any such study will be performed. 
Quality of evidenceThere were no studies to make an assessment of quality of evidence.
