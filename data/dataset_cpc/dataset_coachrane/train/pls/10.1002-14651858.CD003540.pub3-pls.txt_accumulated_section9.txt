Effects of interventions aimed at changing the length of time of consultations between family doctors and patients 
Review question 
Does increasing or decreasing the length of time that primary care physicians allocate to each patient consultation benefit patients, doctors, and the healthcare system? 
Background 
Doctors not having enough time with patients during consultations has been a matter of concern. It has been suggested that if doctors and patients had more time to talk, then patients might be more satisfied with care and their problems better dealt with, or doctors might prescribe less and talk more about how to make lifestyle changes. 
Study characteristics 
We identified five studies conducted in the UK that tested whether methods to change consultation length for family doctors provides any benefit. The studies were conducted in single or multiple practices, and the number of appointments ranged from 200 to 2957 consultations. Four studies compared a change in appointment times from 5 to 15 minutes, and one study compared short versus long consultations with or without treatment for patients with no diagnosis. 
Key results 
All studies tested short‚Äêterm changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. Our confidence in the results of these studies is very low. Consequently, we are not certain whether changing appointment slots leads to an actual increase of the length of the consultation, number of referrals and investigations requested by the doctor, and number of medications prescribed. Likewise, it is unclear whether patients are more satisfied with the health care they receive when appointments are longer. None of the studies reported on the resources associated with lengthening appointments.
