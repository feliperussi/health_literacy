Pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia
Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only treatment proven to be effective for those people who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications. A fast pulse rate (tachycardia) is one of the more common side effects associated with clozapine use. It is reported to occur in 25 out of every 100 people treated with clozapine. The occurrence of a fast pulse rate may lead to palpitations in the person treated with clozapine, which can be unpleasant and worrying. A fast pulse rate by itself is not necessarily dangerous to the person and can be treated. There are medications available to treat a fast pulse rate and slow it down to a normal rate. Examples of such medications include beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers. However, a fast pulse rate can lead to clozapine being stopped by doctors. 
This review is about ways to reduce this problem, to find out if any treatment for a fast heart rate with clozapine use is better than another. This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at treating a fast heart rate associated with clozapine treatment. Unfortunately, we found no studies that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on the treatment is much needed. Finding answers to this question will aid people treated with clozapine, and their doctors, in ensuring that a fast heart rate with clozapine can be treated and that clozapine can be safely continued.
