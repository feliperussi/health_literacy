Which medicines, taken by mouth or injected, work best to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis? 
Key messages 
‐ After six months of treatment, medicines called 'biologics' seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin. 
‐ Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis. 
‐ More studies are needed that compare these types of medicines directly against each other. 
What is psoriasis? 
Psoriasis is an immune condition that affects the skin and, sometimes, the joints. Psoriasis speeds up the production of new skin cells, which build up to form raised patches on the skin known as 'plaques'. Plaques can also be flaky, scaly, itchy, and appear red on white skin, and as darker patches on darker skin tones. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis. 
How is psoriasis treated? 
Treatments for psoriasis depend on how bad the symptoms are. Around 10% to 20% of people with moderate or severe psoriasis will need to take medicines that affect their immune system, to help control the psoriasis. These medicines are called systemic treatments, because they affect the whole body. These are usually taken by mouth (orally) or injected. 
Why did we do this Cochrane Review? 
There are three different types of systemic medicines to treat psoriasis:
‐ 'biologics' – proteins, such as antibodies, that target interleukins and cytokines (parts of the immune system that affect how cells behave);‐ small molecules – organic compounds that affect immune cells; examples include apremilast; and‐ non‐biologic medicines – medicines that have been in use for a long time to treat psoriasis, such as methotrexate, ciclosporin and retinoids.
