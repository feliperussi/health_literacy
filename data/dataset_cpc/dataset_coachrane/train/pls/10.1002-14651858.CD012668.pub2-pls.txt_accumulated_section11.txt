Yoga for urinary incontinence in women
Review question 
We examined whether yoga is useful for treating urinary incontinence in women. We compared yoga to no treatment and to other treatments for incontinence. We also compared yoga added to other treatments to other treatments alone. We focused on incontinence symptoms, quality of life and adverse effects. We also looked for information on the value for money of yoga treatment. 
Background 
Up to 15% of women who are middle‐aged or older may have urinary incontinence. Incontinence can be categorised as urgency urinary incontinence, defined as an involuntary loss of urine associated with a sudden strong desire to urinate, or stress urinary incontinence, where an activity such as sneezing triggers an involuntary leak of urine. Both types can negatively affect quality of life and social, psychological and sexual functioning. Treating incontinence usually begins with advice on lifestyle changes such as lowering caffeine use, behavioural interventions such as bladder training or exercises for the pelvic floor muscles. However, many women are interested in additional treatments such as yoga, a system of philosophy, lifestyle and physical practice that originated in ancient India.

Study characteristics 
We found two studies involving a total of 49 women. One was a six‐week study comparing yoga to a waiting list (delayed treatment) in women with either stress or urgency urinary incontinence. The other was an eight‐week study comparing yoga to mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) in women with urgency urinary incontinence. We also identified an ongoing study involving 50 women that aims to compare yoga with stretching; we will include this study when the results are reported. 
Key results 
The trial comparing yoga to a waiting list did not report the number of women reporting cure but did report on symptoms, condition‐specific quality of life and adverse effects. While this comparison generally favoured the yoga intervention, we are uncertain whether yoga improves urinary incontinence due to the very low certainty of the evidence. There was no difference between groups in the number of women reporting an adverse event and no serious adverse events were reported, but we are uncertain whether yoga increases harms as the certainty of the evidence is very low.
