Carbamazepine for schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia will often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). They may also experience apathy, tiredness, lack of drive and disorganised thoughts and behaviour. These symptoms make schizophrenia a severe illness that affects many people throughout their life. 
The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, although this medication is successful in treating the majority of people, 5% to 15% will continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms. For these people, several treatment options are available: changing the dose of medication; switching to another antipsychotic drug; or taking additional drugs that are not antipsychotics. Carbamazepine is a drug first used to treat epilepsy in the 1950s. It is also used as a mood stabiliser when people change between ‘high’ and ‘low’ moods (for example bi‐polar affective disorder). Side effects of carbamazepine include: poor coordination, headaches and drowsiness. 
This review focuses on the effectiveness of carbamazepine for people with schizophrenia. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register was carried out July 2012. Ten studies were found with 283 people. Carbamazepine was compared with no active medication (‘dummy’ or placebo treatment), versus an antipsychotic or when taken in addition to an antipsychotic. However, all of the 10 studies were small and information in them was of a poor standard. There is therefore a lack of evidence whether carbamazepine reduces symptoms and side effects in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Larger well‐designed trials are necessary to provide stronger evidence before carbamazepine can be recommended as a treatment for people with schizophrenia.
