Histamine type 2 receptor antagonists as adjuvant treatment for resected colorectal cancer 
Colorectal cancer (bowel cancer) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Surgery is the primary curative treatment for those with early stage disease. However, a number of patients relapse after primary surgery, presumably due to cancer cells that have spread undetected to other parts of the body. In general, once colorectal cancer has spread it is no longer curable. Hence, adjuvant treatments are given around the time of surgery to eliminate any remnant cells to improve a patient's chance of cure. 
Histamine type 2 receptor antagonist drugs (H2RAs) were originally developed as a treatment for peptic ulcers. However, anecdotal reports surfaced of tumour shrinkage with the use of these drugs. This launched a number of trials to see if these medications could be used to improve a patient's chance of cure following surgery for colorectal cancer. 
This Cochrane review found six studies that adopted this strategy. There was wide variability amongst the trials in respect to a) the dose used, b) the timing in relation to surgery and c) for how long the H2RA drug was used for. When the results of the trial were analysed together it appeared that there was no survival benefit with the use of these medications. When the studies using cimetidine (a particular H2RA which has a theoretical additional mechanism of action in preventing tumour spread) were analysed, there appeared to be a survival benefit for patients receiving cimetidine. 
Given the variability amongst the trials the results can only be considered as speculative, as opposed to strong evidence for this approach. Furthermore, these trials were conducted in a time where the approach to staging and treatment would be considered sub optimal by today's standards. Hence, further trials in the future are warranted.
