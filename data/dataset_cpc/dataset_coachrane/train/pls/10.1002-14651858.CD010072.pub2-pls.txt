Yoga to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global health burden. Nevertheless, it is thought that the risk of CVD can be lowered by changing a number of risk factors, such as by increasing physical activity and using relaxation to reduce stress, both of which are components of yoga. This review assessed the effectiveness of any type of yoga in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD. 
Study Characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of yoga on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013. 
Key Results 
We found 11 trials (800 participants), none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of yoga on decreasing death or non‐fatal endpoints.There were variations in the style and duration of yoga and the follow‐up of the interventions ranged from three to eight months.The results showed that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (a blood lipid), and uncertain effects on low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. None of the included trials reported adverse events, the occurrence of type 2 diabetes or costs. Longer‐term, high‐quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of yoga for CVD prevention. 
Quality of the Evidence 
These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution. This is because the included studies were of short duration, small and at risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).
