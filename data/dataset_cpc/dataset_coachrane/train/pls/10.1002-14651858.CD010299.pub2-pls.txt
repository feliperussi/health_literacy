Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer 
Background 
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The traditional method of follow‐up involves multiple visits to the hospital to check, for example, whether the cancer has come back (recurrence). This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable. Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow‐up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient‐related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow‐up visits. PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well‐being. Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow‐up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system. There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow‐up visits. It is also unclear whether PROMs are  beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life. 
Study Characteristics 
We performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up. 
Key findings 
No studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found. This highlights the need for good‐quality studies comparing PROMs to standard follow‐up. Evidence from adequately‐powered studies at low risk of bias are needed.
