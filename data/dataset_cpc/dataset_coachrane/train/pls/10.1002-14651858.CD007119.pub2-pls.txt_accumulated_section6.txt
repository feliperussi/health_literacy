Interventions for restoring patency of occluded central venous catheter lumens
A central venous catheter is a small, hollow tube that is inserted into a large vein in either the chest, neck or groin. Central venous catheters enable healthcare professionals to administer drugs and other fluids directly into the blood stream, in order to treat critically ill patients or those patients with a long‚Äêterm condition. In certain chronic conditions, patients or their carers may also be involved with the administration of treatment interventions via the central venous catheter. 
Occasionally, the catheter lumens can become blocked with either a blood clot or a treatment intervention solidifying in the tube, or due to the position of the tube inside the vein. If the catheter does become blocked it may mean that the patient has to undergo further surgery to remove and replace the blocked catheter. 
No studies were found investigating the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions (brush, snare or guidewire exchange) or chemical interventions (hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate, 70% ethanol solution) to unblock the catheter. 
Our search identified seven studies (eight papers), with a total of 632 participants, that investigated different drug comparisons or compared different strengths of drug therapies for treating catheters that were either completely or partially blocked with a blood clot. 
This review has found low to very low quality evidence suggesting that thrombolytic drugs (urokinase and alteplase) could be effective in unblocking central venous catheter lumens blocked by blood clots. However, the total number of participants included in these trials was small and consequently the results of the analysis may well be over exaggerated. There were also issues with the way the studies were conducted that could possibly have introduced bias.
