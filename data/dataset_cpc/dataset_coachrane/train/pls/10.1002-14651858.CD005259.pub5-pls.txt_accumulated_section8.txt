Treatments for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults who have keyhole surgery of the knee 
Key message 
• We did not find clear evidence that the use of clot‐preventing medications (low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH), aspirin or rivaroxaban) in healthy adults who undergo minimally invasive knee surgery can reduce the small risk of blood clots developing in their deep veins, or the small risk that these blood clots travel to a blood vessel in their lungs. 
• We did not find any clear evidence that LMWH, aspirin or rivaroxaban cause harmful effects such as bleeding in these people. 
Why is this question important? 
In knee arthroscopy, a healthcare provider inserts a tiny camera through a small cut in the person's knee. Knee arthroscopy is used to diagnose and repair many types of knee injuries. People who undergo this procedure have a small risk of developing a blood clot in the deep veins of their legs (deep vein thrombosis). Those who get deep vein thrombosis may have symptoms such as calf pain or swelling (symptomatic deep vein thrombosis). There is also a risk that the clots may move to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). People who have surgery often receive medications to lower the risk of clots developing. These medications help to prevent blood clots by thinning the blood, and they may cause side effects such as bleeding. Because the risk of getting a blood clot after knee arthroscopy is small, it is important to know if taking medication to prevent clots is necessary. 
What did we do? 
This systematic review included randomized controlled trials of people who had knee arthroscopy and who either did or did not receive clot‐preventing medication. Randomized studies provide the most reliable evidence about treatment effects because the treatment people receive is decided at random.
