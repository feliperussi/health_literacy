Medical treatment of alcohol‐related liver disease
Background 
Alcohol‐related liver disease or alcoholic liver disease is liver disease related to excessive alcohol consumption. It includes a spectrum of liver diseases that includes alcoholic steatosis (simple fatty liver or simple steatosis or accumulation of fat in liver cells), alcoholic hepatitis (inflammation of liver cells), and alcoholic cirrhosis (destruction of liver cells and replacement with scar tissue). This can cause major health problems such as excessive tiredness, and liver failure leading to vomiting blood, confusion, and death. A number of medical treatments have been used to treat alcohol‐related liver disease. The best way to treat alcohol‐related liver disease is not clear. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised clinical trials whose results were reported until February 2017. We included only studies in which participants had not undergone liver transplantation previously and those who did not have liver disease due to other causes such as viral infections. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we planned to use an advanced method which allows comparison of the many different treatments that are individually compared in the trials (network meta‐analysis). However, because of the nature of the information available, we could not determine whether the network meta‐analysis results were reliable. Therefore, we used standard Cochrane methodology. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 81 trials which were eligible for our review. We have presented the results for people with differing spectrum of alcohol‐related liver disease separately.
