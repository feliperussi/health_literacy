Parent training for parents with intellectual disabilities
Review question 
Do parent training interventions help parents with intellectual disabilities to parent adequately? 
Background 
Parents with intellectual disabilities may find it more difficult than other parents to provide adequate childcare. Parent training programmes are one way of providing support. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of parent training programmes for parents with intellectual disabilities. We found four randomised controlled trials (RCT; a type of experiment where similar people are put into different groups).

Study characteristics 
The four RCTs were conducted in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and USA, and involved 192 parents. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. All but seven of the participating parents were mothers. 
Children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the control groups all received treatment as usual.
