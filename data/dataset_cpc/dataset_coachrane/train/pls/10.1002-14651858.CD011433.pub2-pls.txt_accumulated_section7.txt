Surgical techniques for preventing and treating arm swelling from lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment 
What is the issue? 
Many women in the world are affected by breast cancer. Radiotherapy and surgery used for breast cancer treatments target the breast, chest and axilla (or armpit) of the affected side and could damage the local lymphatics of those regions. This results in poor drainage of fluid from the affected arm, which could lead to a sensation of heaviness and visible swelling. A term used to describe this condition is lymphoedema. Lymphoedema is well‐recognised by patients and health care professionals. It is uncomfortable and could interfere with many aspects of daily life. In addition, some patients regard their one‐sided arm swelling as unsightly. Long‐term swelling could also degrade the quality of the skin and lead to recurrent skin infections. Traditional measures to manage this troublesome condition include arm exercises, massage, and compression stockings. While these measures are effective in reducing the arm swelling, they require time, patience, and daily dedication on the patient's part, and can come at a cost to the patient. These traditional measures need to be continued lifelong in order to remain effective. 
Study question 
Health care professionals have examined alternative ways to manage lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment. This report reviews the effectiveness of surgical techniques that have been developed to either prevent or treat this condition. 
Study results 
A number of techniques have been proposed, but only three studies published by November 2017 met the inclusion criteria for our present review. Two studies looked at preventing lymphoedema and one study looked at treating lymphoedema. In total, these three studies involved 131 individuals.
