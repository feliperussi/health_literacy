Should we place a stent or not after stone removal?
Review question 
For patients with stones in the kidney or in the tube draining urine from the kidney to the bladder that have been removed from the inside by a ureteroscope (a very thin scope), how does placing a stent (a small plastic tube in the ureter) compare to not using a stent? 
Background 
Urologists use small scopes and other tools to find, break up, and remove stones. Afterwards, swelling and blockage of the ureter can cause discomfort. To prevent that from happening, urologists often leave a temporary stent. It is unclear whether a stent makes things better or worse. 
Study characteristics 
We included 23 trials with 2656 people who either had a stent or not. Whether they received a stent or not was decided by chance. 
Key results 
A stent may make people come back to the hospital for problems less often, but we are very uncertain of this finding. Pain on the day of surgery and on days one to three after surgery may be similar. People with a stent may have more pain in the long term (days four to 30), but we are also very uncertain about this. The need for another procedure may be similar. 
People with a stent may be less likely to need narcotics (strong pain medications that can cause addiction), but we are very uncertain about this. There may be no difference in the risk of a urinary tract infection. Stenting may make people a little less likely to develop a narrowing of the ureter because of scarring and may make them slightly less likely to be admitted to the hospital. However, we are very uncertain of both findings. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate, low, or very low confidence in the study results.
