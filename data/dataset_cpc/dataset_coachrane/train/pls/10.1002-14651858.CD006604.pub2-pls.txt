Substances used for expanding the womb cavity during hysteroscopy at outpatient sites
Review question 
Cochrane authors wanted to determine which substance is best for expanding the womb cavity during outpatient hysteroscopy. We checked which substance is better tolerated by the patient, has fewer side effects, is more satisfactory to the operator, and is associated with a shorter procedural duration. 
Background 
The womb is a hollow organ. A hysteroscope is an apparatus that is introduced inside the womb to see inside the cavity. If one is to see, the cavity needs to be filled with a clear substance (distension medium). This substance can be liquid (saline solution) or gas (carbon dioxide). Warming liquid to body temperature was suggested to improve patient tolerability. Each substance has benefits and side effects, which we have compared here. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 randomised controlled trials comparing distension media in a total of 1946 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. Evidence is current to April 2021. 
Key results 
Pain during the procedure may be similar with saline and carbon dioxide. We are uncertain whether saline is as tolerable as carbon dioxide in terms of proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain and the need to use painkillers. Saline is probably associated with fewer side effects than carbon dioxide. Saline may be superior to carbon dioxide in terms of quality of the hysteroscopic view. Evidence is inconclusive for duration of the procedure. 
Compared to room temperature saline, warm saline may reduce pain scores. Evidence is inconclusive for other outcomes in this comparison. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence is of very low to moderate quality. The main limitations of the evidence are inability to mask the intervention from the participant and the operator, lack of precision, and inconsistent results.
