Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to other interventions, placebo ('dummy treatment') or no intervention, for treating people with mucopolysaccharidosis type II. This is an update of a previously published version of this review. 
Background 
Hunter syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis II is a rare genetic disease that occurs when an enzyme that the body needs is either missing or malfunctioning. The body doesn't have adequate supplies of this enzyme to break down certain complex molecules, so these molecules build up in harmful amounts in certain cells and tissues. The build‐up that occurs in Hunter syndrome eventually causes permanent, progressive damage affecting appearance, mental development, organ function and physical abilities. Hunter syndrome appears in children as young as the age of two years and it nearly always occurs in males. In the past, treatment of Hunter syndrome has been limited to the relief of symptoms and complications. Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase aims to replace iduronate‐2‐sulfatase, the enzyme that is deficient or absent in people with Hunter syndrome. However, given its high cost it is essential to assess how effective and safe this treatment is.

Study characteristics 
The review included one study with 96 males with Hunter syndrome aged between 4.9 and 30.9 years of age. The trial compared idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg given either weekly or every‐other week, or weekly infusions of placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted 53 weeks.
