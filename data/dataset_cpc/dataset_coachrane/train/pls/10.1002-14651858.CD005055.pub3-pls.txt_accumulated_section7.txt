Inhaled nitric oxide to treat high blood pressure of the pulmonary vessels after surgery in infants and children with congenital heart disease 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide for treatment of high blood pressure in the pulmonary vessels in infants and children born with heart disease. 
Background 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary vessels that affects various patient populations and can cause poor health and a significant number of deaths. PH can reduce cardiac function and precipitate a life‚Äêthreatening crisis. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a structural deformity of the heart that exists at birth, and often before birth. PH may arise because of increased pulmonary blood flow and persistent raised pulmonary arterial pressures, or following the use of cardiopulmonary bypass during surgical repair. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a therapy which causes a selective reduction in the high blood pressure of the pulmonary vessels without decreasing blood pressure in the rest of the body and, therefore, may have a treatment benefit in children with heart disease. In this review, we aimed to assess the benefits and harms of using iNO for postoperative management of PH in children with CHD. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence was current to December 2013. We found four randomized clinical trials involving 210 participants aged from one day to 17 years with PH either in the preoperative (one study) or postoperative period (three studies). Control groups received conventional management therapy (two trials) or nitrogen gas as placebo (two trials). Two trials compared changes in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure and heart rate (haemodynamics). The other two trials compared the number of pulmonary hypertensive crises and deaths, with changes in haemodynamic measurements as secondary outcomes.
