Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents 
Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, with suggested overall prevalence rates for adolescents (13 to 18 years) being 5.7% and for children (under 13 years) 2.8%. Common symptoms of depression in children and adolescents include low mood, a loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, difficulties with concentration and motivation, changes in appetite and sleep, irritability, physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach aches and in some cases thoughts of suicide. If left untreated, depressive disorders in the younger years are likely to continue into adulthood, and can be increasingly difficult to treat as time goes on. Both psychological therapies and antidepressant medication can be used to treat depression in children and adolescents. Psychological therapies, sometimes called 'talking therapies', involve working with a qualified therapist to treat the depression. Psychological therapies in common use are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. There are many different types of antidepressant medication, all of which have been developed specifically to work on chemicals in the brain that are believed to be linked to depression. Research has been undertaken on psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, to asses the effects of these interventions on depression in children and adolescents. 
In order to asses whether either intervention or a combination of both is most effective, we included studies that compared: (1) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication; (2) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either psychotherapy alone or antidepressant medication alone; (3) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with a placebo or'treatment as usual'; (4) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either therapy plus a placebo.
