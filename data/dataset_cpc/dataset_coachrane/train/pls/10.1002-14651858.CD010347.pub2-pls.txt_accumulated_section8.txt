Is adding an anti‐leukotriene to an inhaled corticosteroid better than using an inhaled corticosteroid alone for persistent asthma? 
Background: A daily low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the recommended first preventer treatment offered to adults and teenagers with asthma. Patients with inadequate asthma control are often treated by adding an anti‐leukotriene (LTRA) or a long‐acting β2‐agonist, or by increasing the dose of ICS. 
Review question: Is adding an anti‐leukotriene to ICS better than using an ICS alone for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma? 
Study characteristics: We found 37 studies (representing 6128 adults and adolescents). The people in these trials had mild to moderate asthma. Most (24) studies used the LTRA called montelukast, 11 studies used zafirlukast and only two studies used pranlukast. 
We divided all studies into three categories to help us make sense of the evidence.
• Anti‐leukotrienes and ICS versus same dose of ICS: Ten studies (representing 2364 adults and adolescents) contributed data for analysis. Anti‐leukotrienes given with ICS reduced by half the number of patients with exacerbations requiring oral steroids (from 9% to 5% over three months), but we are unsure about effects of this treatment on quality of life or serious side effects. Anti‐leukotrienes given with ICS improved lung function and asthma control measures. 
• Anti‐leukotrienes and ICS versus higher dose of ICS: Eight studies (representing 2008 adults and adolescents) contributed data for analysis. Results showed no reduction in the number of patients with exacerbations requiring oral steroids and no difference in quality of life nor in side effects. Data showed no improvement in lung function nor in asthma control measures. 
• Anti‐leukotrienes and gradual reduction of ICS dose versus gradual reduction of ICS dose alone: Seven studies (representing 1150 adults and adolescents) evaluated anti‐leukotrienes given with a gradually reduced dose of ICS compared with a gradually reduced dose of ICS without use of anti‐leukotriene agents. This approach was not beneficial for % reduction in the amount of ICS over time. More people receiving anti‐leukotriene and ICS compared with ICS alone experienced increased serious side effects and showed no improvement in lung function nor in asthma control measures.
