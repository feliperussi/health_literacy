Face‐down positioning to improve outcomes following surgery for macular holes
The eye is responsible for focusing and transforming light stimuli into nerve signals that are processed in the brain for visual perception. The back of the eye is lined by the retina, a layered sheet of nerve cells, and filled with clear gel, known as vitreous gel. The macula is the central area of the retina responsible for perception of fine detail and colour vision. Disorders of the macula typically result in significant visual impairment. 
Idiopathic macular hole, an age‐related disease, is an important cause of visual loss. The disorder affects at least two per 1000 individuals aged over 40 years. Development of macular holes is believed to result from traction exerted by the vitreous, with separation of the hole edges from the underlying pigment epithelial cells. Macular holes are conventionally managed by surgical removal of the vitreous gel to relieve the tractional forces. Injection of gas (intraocular gas tamponade) into the vitreous cavity is performed with the aim of promoting hole closure. 
Following surgery for macular hole, a period of face‐down positioning for up to two weeks may be advised, with the aim of improving the likelihood of success by maintaining contact of the gas meniscus with the macula. However, face‐down positioning is of unproven benefit, uncomfortable and associated with adverse events including ulnar nerve injury. 
We conducted a systematic review of outcomes for individuals with idiopathic macular holes following postoperative face‐down positioning. We found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two of the three trials suggested a benefit in holes larger than 400 microns in diameter. None demonstrated evidence of a benefit in smaller holes.
