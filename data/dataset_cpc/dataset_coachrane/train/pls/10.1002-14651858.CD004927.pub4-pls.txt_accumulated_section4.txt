Surgical treatment for difficulty emptying the bladder due to disco‐ordination between bladder and sphincter muscle in adults with neurogenic bladder 
Damage to the nervous system can lead to a lack of co‐ordination (dyssynergia) between the bladder (detrusor) and the muscle at the exit of the bladder that allows people to control their bladder emptying (external urethral sphincter muscle). This urologic condition is called detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) and is most frequently seen in people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Insufficient relaxation of the sphincter during a voiding contraction prevents effective bladder emptying and can lead to high pressures in the bladder. People with increased bladder pressures are at an increased risk for bladder and kidney infections, which may lead to kidney damage and even failure. 
Treatment is aimed at lowering these pressures by promoting proper bladder emptying. This can be achieved by inserting a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra (i.e. the tube connected to the bladder through which urine is released from the body) to empty the bladder on a regular basis (intermittent catheterisation), use of drugs, or surgery. The first step in treatment is usually not surgery, but surgical options should be considered if this is not possible or feasible. Different types of surgical treatment exist, but the optimal surgical treatment for this condition in adults is as yet unknown. This question is the subject of this review. 
We found five trials, which included a total of 199 people (with an average age of 40 years) with a variety of causes of DSD. One trial showed that a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the sphincter (sphincterotomy) is better in lowering bladder pressure than placing a permanent thin tube into the urethra (urethral stent), but only after two years.
