Sharing information about the diagnosis and outcomes of schizophrenia: evidence from well‐designed clinical trials 
Background 
Health professionals have a duty to give information to their patients in a way that is understandable, especially when the condition is severe and life altering. Schizophrenia and similar related disorders are serious mental illnesses that can have long term, disruptive effects on the lives of both patients and their carers. The way a person is told they have a serious illness and what having this illness will mean for them can affect how they accept their diagnosis and treatment plans which then ultimately can affect their recovery and long‐term outlook. At the moment, there is no information or evidence regarding how best to disclose a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Searching for evidence 
In June 2015 and June 2016, we explored the medical literature and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register using appropriate keywords to find any studies which evaluated a method that guided or helped health professionals with how to deliver the news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We specifically searched for randomised controlled trials as these are considered the best way (gold standard) to evaluate the effects of treatments. We identified 44 publications and inspected these. From these, we obtained seven full reports of trials and that we thought could be relevant; however, none of these studies could be included in the review. 
Conclusions 
Currently health professionals can use good quality, evidence based information to guide them in the sharing of news about diagnosis of a serious physical illnesses; however, there is no such evidence available concerning the sharing of news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. This is a serious gap in knowledge which needs attention and studies are needed in this area.
