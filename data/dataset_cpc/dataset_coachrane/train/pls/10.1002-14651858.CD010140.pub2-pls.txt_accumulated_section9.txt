Skin antisepsis for reducing central venous catheter‐related infections
Review Question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether using antiseptic treatments on people's skin helps reduce infections related to central venous catheters (CVCs). 
Background 
Central venous catheters (CVCs) are thin, flexible tubes that are inserted through the skin into a large vein, often in the arm or chest. The tube can then be used to give fluids, medicine and nutrition to chronically and critically ill patients. However, CVCs pose a significant risk of infection by providing a way for micro‐organisms (germs) to spread into the body at the point where the catheter is inserted. In order to try to reduce catheter‐related infections, healthcare staff frequently use antiseptic solutions to clean the skin around the catheter insertion site, both prior to insertion and whilst the catheter is in place. In this review, we summarise the evidence of the benefits and harms of using antiseptics on the skin, and the effects of different antiseptic solutions. 
Search date 
We searched multiple medical databases in May 2016.
Study characteristics 
In May 2016 we searched medical databases to find randomised controlled trials looking at the use of skin antiseptics in people with CVCs. We included 13 studies in this review, although only 12 studies contributed data for a total of 3446 CVCs. The study participants were mainly adults in intensive care units or other specialist hospital units. We reported our findings in terms of the number of catheters, as some studies did not provide the number of patients assessed, and some patients had more than one CVC.One study was funded by a national research body, five studies were funded in whole or in part by at least a pharmaceutical company, and in the remaining seven studies funding sources were not stated.
