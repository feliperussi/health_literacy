Topical antibiotics to help reduce death and respiratory infections in people in intensive care receiving mechanical ventilation 
Review question 
We aimed to assess the effect of two topical antibiotic regimens (selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD)) in preventing deaths and respiratory infections in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours in intensive care units (ICUs). In SDD, non‐absorbable antibiotics are applied to the oropharynx (back third of the tongue, the soft palate, the side and back walls of the throat and tonsils), oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. SOD involves the application of non‐absorbable antibiotics to the oropharynx only. These regimens may be given alone or in combination with systemic antibiotics. 
Background 
Infections acquired in ICUs are important complications of treatment with ventilation (invasive mechanical breathing support) in patients with very severe diseases who require such treatment. Some of these people will die because of these infections. One method that has been evaluated to reduce these complications is to use antibiotics as a preventative measure.

Study characteristics: 
We included 41 trials involving a total of 11,004 patients mechanically ventilated in ICUs to find out whether giving topical antibiotics, alone or in combination with systemic antibiotics, prevents respiratory tract infections and reduces death. Antibiotics were administered either topically (e.g. antibiotics were applied directly to the oropharynx or to the stomach via a nasogastric tube) or systemically (e.g. intravenously (directly into the patient's vein)). 
Study funding sources 
Twenty‐two studies (52.4%) did not report the funding source; 6 studies (14.3%) were supported by public institutional grants; and 13 studies (30.1%) were totally or partially funded by pharmaceutical companies.
