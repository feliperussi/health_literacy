Cholinergic medication for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia
Review question. 
Are cholinergic drugs useful for treating the unpleasant side‐effect ‐ tardive dyskinesia ‐ in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental health problems who are taking antipsychotics. 
Background. 
People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side‐effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high dose of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. It has been proposed that tardive dyskinesia could be due to cholinergic deficiency. Older cholinergic drugs, such as deanol, lecithin and meclofenoxate, have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia. New cholinergic drugs, such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and may also be promising in the treatment for tardive dyskinesia. 
Study characteristics. 
We searched for trials in July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo. All studies randomised small numbers of participants (five to 60 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. 
Key results. 
We found the effects of both older and newer cholinergic drugs to be unclear as too few and too small studies are available and do not yield great evidence and leave many questions unanswered.
