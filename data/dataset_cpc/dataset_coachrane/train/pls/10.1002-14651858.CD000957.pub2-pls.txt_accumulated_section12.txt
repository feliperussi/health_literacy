Methotrexate for treating rheumatoid arthritis
We looked at studies until November 2013 on the effect of receiving methotrexate alone compared to placebo (no treatment) over 12 to 52 weeks in 732 people with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Key findings 
In the short term treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate:
‐ improves pain, function and other symptoms;
‐ probably reduces joint damage as seen on the x‐ray.
Precise information about side effects and complications was not always available. Common side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, stomach pain, and sores on lips, mouth or throat. Rare complications may include birth defects, kidney, lung and liver problems. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints making your joints swollen, stiff and painful. Treatments aim to decrease symptoms and improve your ability to move. 
Methotrexate is one of a group of medications called disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and it is the most common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate helps prevent further permanent damage that can happen if rheumatoid arthritis is not treated. 
What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate alone? 
ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)  ‐ 15 more people out of 100 experienced major improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis after 12 months with methotrexate when compared to placebo (15% absolute improvement). ‐ 23 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone experienced major improvement. ‐ 8 people out of 100 who took a placebo experienced major improvement.
