Ivabradine as adjuvant treatment for chronic heart failure
What is the aim of this review? 
We investigated the effects of ivabradine (either as short‐term treatment (< 6 months) or long‐term treatment (≥ 6 months) in people with heart failure and preserved (HFpEF, left ventricular ejection fraction is 50% or higher) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40%). 
Key messages 
We found that long‐term ivabradine has no effect on death from cardiovascular causes in people with HFrEF. We also found that there is no difference between long‐term ivabradine and placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or no treatment in the rate of serious adverse events in people with HFrEF. 
What was studied in this review? 
Heart failure is a common condition that occurs when the heart muscle is too weak to pump blood sufficiently to the body, which leads to symptoms like shortness of breath, tiredness, swelling of the legs, and a limited ability to exercise. About half of people who suffer from heart failure die within five years of diagnosis. Several medications are known to be effective in treating heart failure; however, we wanted to know if ivabradine could improve survival. Seven studies focused on short‐term treatment (< 6 months) with ivabradine, and eleven studies focused on a long‐term treatment (≥ 6 months) with ivabradine. One study provided no information on duration of ivabradine administration. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found 19 randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 19,628 participants investigating ivabradine. Eleven studies focused on HFrEF, three studies on HFpEF, and one study on heart failure with mid‐range ejection fraction (HFmrEF); no details were provided on heart failure in the remaining studies.
