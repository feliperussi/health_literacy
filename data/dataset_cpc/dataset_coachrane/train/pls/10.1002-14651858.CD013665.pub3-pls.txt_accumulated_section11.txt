How accurate are symptoms and medical examination to diagnose COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ The results suggest that a single symptom included in this review cannot accurately diagnose COVID‐19. 
‐ Loss of sense of taste or smell could be a 'red flag' for the presence of COVID‐19. Cough or fever might be useful to identify people who might have COVID‐19. These symptoms might be useful to prompt further testing when they are present. 
‐ We need more research to investigate combinations of symptoms and signs with other information such as recent contact or travel history, or vaccination status, and in children, and adults aged 65 years and over. 
What are symptoms or signs of COVID‐19? 
Symptoms are experienced by patients. COVID‐19 symptoms include cough, sore throat, high temperature, diarrhoea, headache, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. 
Signs are measured by healthcare workers during clinical examination. They include lung sounds, blood pressure, blood oxygen level and heart rate. 
Symptoms and signs of COVID‐19 might be important to help people know whether they and the people they come into contact with should isolate at home, undergo testing with a rapid lateral flow test or PCR (laboratory‐based) test, or be hospitalised. 
What did we want to find out? 
Symptoms and signs of COVID‐19 are varied and may indicate other diseases, not just COVID‐19. We wanted to know how accurate diagnosis of COVID‐19 is, based on symptoms and signs from medical examination. We were interested in people with suspected COVID‐19, who go to their doctor, outpatient test centres or hospital.
