A physical therapy program consisting of a standard physical therapy program (stretching and other exercises, ultrasound and electrical stimulation), plus extra mobilisation and gait training exercises, compared with a standard physical therapy program alone, 
‐ May improve pain.
‐ Function was not measured.

What is osteoarthritis and how is it treated? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints. When your joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful. 
Doctors used to think that osteoarthritis was caused by wear and tear on the cartilage. However, it's now thought that osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint. Many factors may increase your risk of getting osteoarthritis in the big toe joint, such as particular foot structure, trauma, family history of the disease, joint disease, and gait abnormalities. 
OA is one of the most common forms of arthritis and affects men and women equally. OA is one of the main causes of disability as people grow older. 
Interventions such as physical therapy, including exercises aim to enhance or maintain muscle strength, physical fitness and overall health. People exercise for many different reasons including weight loss, strengthening muscles and to relieve the symptoms of OA.
