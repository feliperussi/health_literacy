What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for American (muco)cutaneous leishmaniasis (a parasitic disease of the skin and mucous membranes)? 
Why this question is important 
American (muco)cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACML) is a disfiguring disease that affects people in Central and South America. It is caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans by sandflies. Different forms of ACML have different symptoms. People with the cutaneous form develop skin sores that often heal within a few months without treatment, but can leave scars. In people with mucosal or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, destructive sores develop in the protective lining (mucous membranes) of the nose, mouth and throat. 
To compare the effectiveness and risks of the many treatments for ACML, we reviewed evidence from research studies (randomised controlled trials). We looked for information on the proportion of people whose sores had healed three months or more after treatment, unwanted effects, quality of life, re‐appearance of sores, damage associated with the disease and prevention of scarring. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies. We then compared the results, summarised the evidence, and assessed the certainty of the evidence. 
What we found 
We found 75 studies on 6533 people (approximately 75% male; average age: 29 years).
‐ One study investigated children (2 to 12 years).‐ Most studies (67) involved people with cutaneous leishmaniasis.‐ Eight studies investigated people with mucosal or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.‐ The parasite Leishmania braziliensis caused the disease in 52 studies.‐ Studies were conducted at regional hospitals, local clinics, and research centres.‐ Studies lasted between 28 days and seven years.‐ Most studies reported their funding source: the US army funded eight studies, industry funded 10, and institutional grants funded 33 (five of these also reported industry funding).
