Cycle regimens for frozen‐thawed embryo transfer
Review question: Cochrane review authors investigated different regimens used for preparing the uterus (womb) for transferring frozen‐thawed embryos to the uterus in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) to become pregnant. 
Background 
In subfertile women undergoing ART, eggs are collected from the ovaries and fertilised by sperm in a laboratory (in vitro fertilisation or IVF). Some or all embryos may be frozen, to be thawed and transferred to the womb at a later stage. This is called frozen‐thawed embryo transfer (or FET). 
Women with regular spontaneous periods (menstrual cycles) may be offered a range of cycle regimens to prepare the womb lining for FET. Alternatively, FET can be carried out after spontaneous ovulation (release of an egg) in a natural cycle. This is called natural cycle FET. 
Women with irregular cycles are either not ovulating or are ovulating randomly. Therefore, natural cycle FET is not suitable for them. These women can be offered either ovulation induction with fertility drugs or hormone therapy (HT) to prepare them for FET. 
The most common regimens for FET are natural cycle with or without HCG (human chorionic gonadrotophin) trigger, or endometrial preparation with HT with or without a gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to temporarily suppress ovarian function. 
We conducted this review to find out if a particular FET regimen is more effective or safer than others. Our main outcomes were live birth rates and miscarriage rates per woman. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 randomized controlled trials with 3815 women. The trials were conducted in Belgium, France, Israel, Italy, Iran, Singapore, the Netherlands and the UK. The evidence is current to 2 December 2016.
