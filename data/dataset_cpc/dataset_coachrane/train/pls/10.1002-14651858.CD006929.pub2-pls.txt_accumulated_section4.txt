Inconclusive, but promising evidence for the efficacy of functional analysis interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia 
The management of challenging behaviour, such as aggression and agitation in dementia has been dominated by drug therapies such as the antipsychotics, despite their modest efficacy, side effects and potential detriment to quality of life. Functional analysis (FA) is a behavioural intervention that is described by international guidelines as the first line alternative to drug therapy for challenging behaviour. FA typically requires the therapist to develop an understanding of the function or meaning behind the person’s distressed behaviour. It uses this understanding to develop individually tailored strategies aimed at both the person with dementia and the caregivers, to relieve the distress caused by the behaviour. FA can be applied in home settings where the family or informal caregiver is offered support from a therapist, or in care homes, hospitals or assisted living settings, where training in FA and specialist support to deliver interventions is provided for staff.  
In this review we analysed the effectiveness of functional analysis‐based interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia. We found eighteen randomised controlled trials suitable for analysis in all four types of care settings. The majority were in family care settings and there were surprisingly few care home based studies. Most evaluated broad programmes of care, where FA was just one component of a wide range of other interventions. This made it hard to determine the real effect of FA for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.  
However, positive results were noted in the frequency of the person’s reported problem behaviours and the caregiver’s reaction to them. No significant effects were found for incidence or severity of mood and other problem behaviours. Similarly, no significant effects were found for caregiver mood or burden.
