The effect of adding a long‐acting beta‐agonist to inhaled steroids in people not previously treated with inhaled steroids 
In patients with asthma who require daily anti‐inflammatory therapy, there is insufficient evidence to support initiating therapy with a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long‐acting ß2‐agonist (LABA) rather than with inhaled corticosteroids alone. Most consensus statements recommend the addition of LABA as second line therapy, only in asthmatic individuals who remain insufficiently controlled on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids. Yet, many physicians initiate combination therapy in patients with asthma, without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids alone. The purpose of this review was to compare the benefit and safety profile of initiating treatment with the combination of ICS and LABA as compared to a (1) similar and (2) higher dose of ICS alone in asthmatic patients who had not received ICS previously. This review identified 28 randomised controlled trials. The combination of ICS and LABA did not reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids but improved lung function, symptoms and minimally reduced the use of rescue ß2‐agonists as compared to a similar dose of ICS alone. Initiating ICS at a higher dose than that used with LABA in the control group significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations and study withdrawals over that observed with the combination of LABA and a lower dose of ICS; there is insufficient evidence to comment on the impact on lung function, symptoms and use of rescue ß2‐agonists. The current evidence does not support use of combination therapy with LABA and ICS as first line treatment in adults and children with asthma, without a prior trial of inhaled corticosteroids.
