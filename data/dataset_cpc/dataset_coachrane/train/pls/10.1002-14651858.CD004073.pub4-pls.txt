Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage occurs frequently among pregnant women but it is often difficult to know the factors responsible. Poor diet, without enough vitamins, has been associated with an increased risk of women losing their baby in early pregnancy. Does vitamin supplementation taken by women before pregnancy and during pregnancy decrease the risk of spontaneous miscarriage? Does supplementation improve maternal, birth and infant outcomes, and are there any side effects? 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin supplementation is commonly recommended for pregnant women and women planning to conceive. Considering the widespread use of vitamin supplementation before and during pregnancy, it is important to study the relation between vitamin supplementation and early pregnancy outcomes, particularly since the causes of miscarriage are unknown and the nutritional status of a mother can affect her babyâ€™s development. 
What evidence did we find? 
This review included 40 randomised controlled trials involving 276,820 women and 278,413 pregnancies. Supplementing women with any vitamins does not reduce the number of women who have miscarriages. However, the risk for stillbirth was reduced among women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid compared with iron and folate only groups. Although total fetal loss was lower in women who were given multivitamins without folic acid and multivitamins with or without vitamin A, these findings included one trial each with small numbers of women involved. Also, they include studies where the comparison groups included women receiving either vitamin A or placebo, and thus require caution in interpretation. 
What does this mean? 
Taking vitamin supplements before pregnancy or in early pregnancy may be beneficial; but this review did not show sufficient evidence that taking vitamin supplements prevents miscarriage.
