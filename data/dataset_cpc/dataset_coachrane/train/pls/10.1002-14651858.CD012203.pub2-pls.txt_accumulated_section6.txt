Interventions for improving outcomes in pregnancies that follow stillbirth
We aimed to compare the effectiveness of different interventions or models of care in improving pregnancy outcomes for parents who have had a previous stillbirth at 20 weeks' gestation or more. The care could be initiated before pregnancy, or during pregnancy, labour, or birth. 
What is the issue? 
Every year at least 2.6 million families experience the tragedy of stillbirth. This is a devastating event that can have long‐term consequences and change parents' attitudes to future pregnancies. Many different causes can lead to stillbirth, and sometimes multiple causes occur together. Causes such as long‐term health problems in the mother are still present in subsequent pregnancies. The parents may therefore benefit from special care before becoming pregnant again. Such care may be highly diverse, addressing a range of risk factors, conditions, and other considerations. This care can take the form of counselling or social support programmes to assist with dealing with grief, anxiety and depression; better managing a mother's health before conception to address health issues; and assisting with high‐risk behaviours or risk factors such as being overweight, smoking, or alcohol use. Once pregnant, the mother can be closely watched, possibly with extra antenatal visits or by attending special antenatal clinics. A planned early birth may also be considered. 
Why is this important? 
Parents who have had a stillborn baby are more likely to have another stillbirth than parents who have not had a stillborn baby before. In their next pregnancy, parents often experience anxiety and depression, and ongoing worry about whether their baby will survive. It is important to be able to work out from high‐quality clinical studies which interventions are helpful in preventing stillbirth from happening again, and in improving the health and well‐being of these parents and families.
