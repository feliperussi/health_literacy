Rescue high‐frequency jet ventilation versus conventional ventilation for severe pulmonary dysfunction in preterm infants 
Background: In very low birth weight infants who require support on breathing machines (ventilators), ventilator‐associated lung injury and toxic effects of oxygen may be important factors in creating a chronic disturbance in lung function. Compared with routine conventional ventilators, high‐frequency jet ventilators (breathing machines that introduce short‐duration pulses of gas under pressure into the airway at a very fast rate) may reduce the severity of lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. 
Question: In preterm infants with severe respiratory dysfunction despite attempts at conventional ventilator support, does use of rescue high‐frequency jet ventilation compared with ongoing conventional ventilation decrease the risk of lung injury (chronic lung disease) or death? 
Study characteristics: One study randomly assigned 166 preterm infants and reported data on 144 infants. The included study was completed before the introduction of surfactant and widespread use of antenatal steroids. 
Key Results: This trial demonstrated no differences in outcomes among infants who received high‐frequency jet ventilation. In this trial, cross‐over to the alternate treatment was permitted if initial treatment failed. Investigators found no statistically significant differences in overall mortality (including survival after cross‐over) between the two groups. In a secondary analysis, researchers showed that rescue treatment with HFJV, up to the time of cross‐over, was associated with lower mortality. Researchers reported no differences in the incidence of chronic lung disease among survivors at 28 days of age, and they found no differences in intraventricular haemorrhage, new air leaks, airway obstruction and necrotising tracheobronchitis.
