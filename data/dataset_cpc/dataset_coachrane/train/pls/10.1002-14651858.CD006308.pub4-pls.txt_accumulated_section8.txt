Workplace interventions to deal with occupational asthma
Clinicians and researchers have proposed several changes in workplaces to improve the status of workers who have occupational asthma, which is asthma whose onset is caused by occupational exposures. These workplace changes are also called interventions, and for occupational asthma include early removal from exposure and reduction of exposure. However, the actual benefits of these interventions are still unclear. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the effectiveness of workplace interventions for the treatment of occupational asthma. 
Key messages 
We conducted a systematic review of workplace interventions for treating occupational asthma. Asthma symptoms and lung function may improve when persons with occupational asthma are removed from exposure, usually by ending their job, compared to continued exposure on the same job. Asthma symptoms but not lung function may improve after reducing exposure, for example by training and education, compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure may improve symptoms and lung function more than exposure reduction among workers exposed to low molecular weight agents, but removal from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment. All evidence was of very low quality and therefore there is a need for better studies to investigate the effectiveness of workplace interventions for occupational asthma. 
What was studied in the review? 
The review is based on 26 studies that included 1,695 participants with occupational asthma. Sensitizers caused nearly all cases. We focused on the interventions of removal from exposure and reduction of exposure, which were compared with continued exposure. Outcomes were changes in asthma symptoms, lung function, and non‐specific bronchial hyperreactivity between baseline and follow‐up.
