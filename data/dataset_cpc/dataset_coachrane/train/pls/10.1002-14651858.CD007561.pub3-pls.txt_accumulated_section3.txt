Effectiveness of angioplasty compared with stenting in atherosclerotic disease of the iliac arteries 
Background 
Atherosclerosis in the iliac artery (main pelvic artery towards the leg) may result in narrowing or obstruction (occlusion), leading to reduced blood flow to the leg. This is called iliac artery occlusive disease. Iliac artery occlusive disease may lead to symptoms of pain in the legs when walking (intermittent claudication), pain at rest, or ulcers of the foot or leg. A range of surgical and endovascular (from inside the artery, e.g. angioplasty) treatment options are available. Open surgical procedures have excellent patency rates (percentage of the vessels that remain open) but at the cost of substantial illness and death. Endovascular treatment has good safety and short‚Äêterm effectiveness with decreased illness, complications and costs compared with open surgical procedures. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; dilation of the artery with a balloon) and stenting (insertion of a small mesh tube) are widely used endovascular treatment options for iliac artery occlusive disease. A narrowing or obstruction of the iliac artery can be treated successfully by PTA alone. If PTA alone is not successful, an additional stent can be placed. Alternatively, a stent could be placed on its own to treat an iliac narrowing or obstruction (this is called primary stenting (PS)). However, there is limited evidence to prove which endovascular treatment strategy is better for lesions that restrict the iliac arteries. This review investigates whether it is better to place a stent in the first instance, or only under particular circumstances.
