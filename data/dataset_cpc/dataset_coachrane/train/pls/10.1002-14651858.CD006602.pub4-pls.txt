Palivizumab for reducing the risk of severe RSV infection in children
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of acute respiratory infections in children. RSV infection can lead to morbidity and mortality in children, resulting in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, the need for intensive medical therapies and death. 
Most infected children suffer little consequence. However, children who have other serious health problems are known to be at higher risk of complications from RSV infection. This review examined the use of a passive immunisation ‐ palivizumab ‐ to prevent and modify the severity of RSV infection in these children and to determine if it is cost‐effective. 
The results from this review are based on data from seven studies (all sponsored by the drug manufacturing company) involving 11,096 participants reporting on efficacy and safety of palivizumab, and 34 studies reporting on its cost‐effectiveness. 
Our findings suggest a favorable effect of preventive use of palivizumab in children who are at higher risk of acquiring severe RSV infection, when compared to placebo. Children treated with palivizumab were less often hospitalised, spent fewer days in the hospital, were admitted to an intensive care unit less often, and had fewer days of oxygen therapy than children who received a placebo. 
Considering the underlying health problems in this population of infants and children, high rates of adverse events are quite expected. Our findings showed that children treated with palivizumab experienced adverse events similarly as often as children treated with placebo. 
Palivizumab was shown to be effective in reducing the hospitalisations, but whether it is also cost‐effective is not easy to determine. This review found large differences in cost‐effectiveness results across the studies. Due to the high costs of the drug, in many countries palivizumab prophylaxis might not be available as a standard treatment.
