Non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after a heart vessel stent placement
Background 
Choosing the optimal treatment for people on long term blood thinners (due to atrial fibrillation), who require a heart vessel stent placement (after a heart attack or angina) remains a challenge in clinical practice. They need to take blood thinners to prevent a stroke, and antiplatelet drugs to prevent blood clots in the stents. However, this combination increases the risk of potentially life‐threatening bleeding, and thus, the optimal treatment remains uncertain. The aim of this review was to investigate whether next‐generation blood thinners (NOACs) are safer and more effective than older blood‐thinning medications (such as warfarin) in this group of individuals. 
Study characteristics 
We identified nine studies that compared NOACs with warfarin, four of which were ongoing studies. We included five trials involving 8373 participants in this review. Evidence is current to February 2019. 
Key results 
There may be little or no difference in effect between NOACs and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation, who underwent heart vessel stenting. However, NOACs probably reduce the need for hospitalisation compared to warfarin. 
NOACs may be safer than warfarin. One of NOACs drugs (dabigatran) may reduce the rate of both major and non‐major bleeding. Other NOAC drugs (apixaban and rivaroxaban) probably reduce the rate of non‐major bleeding. There was no significant difference between NOACs agents in any primary or secondary outcomes. 
Quality of evidence: 
The evidence ranged from Very low‐ to moderate‐certainty, indicating the need for more research on this issue.
