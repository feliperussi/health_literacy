Interventions for preventing or reducing dryness symptoms or upper respiratory infections in educational settings and at the workplace 
Our aim was to find out if humidification of indoor air can prevent or reduce dryness symptoms or upper respiratory infections in the educational setting and at the workplace. 
During the heating period, the humidity of indoor air is low, which can lead to complaints such as dryness of eyes, nose, throat and skin. Furthermore, the dry and irritated mucosa can in turn lead to susceptibility to upper airways infections. These conditions could also be associated with not going to work and to schools. Increasing indoor air humidity by setting up humidifiers might prevent or reduce dryness symptoms or upper respiratory infections. 
Studies found: 
We included 13 studies with 4551 participants. Seven studies were conducted at the workplace (in hospitals and in offices) and five studies were set in educational settings (kindergarten and schools). The data from one study could not be analysed for the purpose of this review. 
Humidification of indoor air versus no humidification 
The included studies showed that increasing indoor air humidity by installing humidifiers at the workplaces had no effect, and other studies showed a decrease in symptoms of dryness of the eye, skin and upper airways. However, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. 
Regarding non‚Äêattendance, the results of the studies (most of them conducted in the educational setting) are also not consistent. The evidence was of very low certainty. 
Quality of evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low, because of limitations in the studies. This means that we cannot be confident of the overall findings.
