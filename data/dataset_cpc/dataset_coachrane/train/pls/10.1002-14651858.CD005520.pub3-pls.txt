Oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances for obstructive sleep apnoea in children 
Review question 
Are oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances effective and safe for treating children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome? 
Background 
Obstructive sleep apnoea in children is a breathing disorder characterized by episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. There are various risk factors and is associated with daytime and night‐time symptoms including among others sleepiness, irritability, tiredness, morning headaches, nasal stuffiness, habitual snoring, nightmares, etc. The common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea in childhood is adeno‐tonsillectomy, the removal of the adenoids and tonsils. This approach is limited by recurrence that can be associated with craniofacial problems. Oral/functional orthopaedic appliances have been used for patients who have obstructive sleep apnoea and craniofacial anomalies because they hold the lower jaw (mandible) forwards which potentially enlarges the upper airway and increases the upper airspace, improving the respiratory function. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 7 April 2016. It included only one study in which 32 children were randomised to receive an oral appliance or no treatment. Twenty‐three participants finished the study. 
Key results 
Treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in children appears to be possible with oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances. However, this is only based on data from one small study. 
Quality of the evidence 
This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as very low. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclude that oral or functional orthopaedic appliances are effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children.
