Chest physiotherapy for pneumonia in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of any type of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia. 
Background 
Pneumonia is a type of lung infection and the biggest cause of worldwide deaths among children aged up to five years. Chest physiotherapy may contribute to children's recovery because it can help to open airways and assist breathing. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 22 February 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included six studies involving 559 children with pneumonia aged from 29 days to 12 years. This is an update of a review published in 2013 and includes three new studies. 
Studies were conducted in hospitals in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. 
Pneumonia was described as moderate to severe in three studies, but severity was not described in three studies. All studies included children who received physiotherapy and others who did not. All children also received standard medical treatment for pneumonia. 
The studies assessed deaths, length of hospital stay, time taken to attain normal test results (no signs of pneumonia), and adverse events. 
Study funding sources 
Four studies reported sources of funding (a child health agency, university, government research grants), and two did not report study funding sources. 
Key results 
One study reported fewer deaths in children who received bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP). Physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) were not associated with shorter hospital stays. Two studies reported improvements in blood oxygen levels after chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy). No clear improvement in respiratory rate was observed after conventional chest physiotherapy. Based on the available evidence, we could not confirm if chest physiotherapy is beneficial or not for children with pneumonia.
