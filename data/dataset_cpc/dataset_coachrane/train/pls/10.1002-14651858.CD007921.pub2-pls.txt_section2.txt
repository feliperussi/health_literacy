If the artery to the lower leg is blocked, replacement of the blocked segment with a bypass graft can save the leg from amputation and reduce the pain resulting from inadequate blood supply to the leg. The best material to use for a bypass graft is the patient's own vein (autologous vein). If a suitable vein is not available, then an artificial tube (synthetic graft) is used. The outcome from these synthetic grafts is less favourable than with autologous veins if the graft extends to below the knee. This review looked at six trials, with a combined total of 885 patients, which compared different methods of making these grafts. Results from two trials which looked at the effect of inserting a cuff of vein at the lower end of the synthetic graft before attaching it to the artery below the knee are conflicting. With one study showing thatÂ the bypass graft remains functional for a longer period of time and in the other study no benefit was seen. If a synthetic graft is made in a fashion imitating the shape of a vein cuff, then the same benefit can be achieved. The results also show that when short lengths of vein are joined together to form a sufficiently long graft, the bypass works for longer, although this does not result in fewer amputations. Finally, there is no added benefit for graft patency or amputation rate if a connection is made between the artery and the vein (fistula) when constructing a vein cuff with the synthetic graft but the operation takes longer.
