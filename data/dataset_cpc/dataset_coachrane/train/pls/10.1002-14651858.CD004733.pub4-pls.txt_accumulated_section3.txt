Oral betamimetics for the prevention of preterm labour and birth for women with twin pregnancies 
There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the routine use of oral betamimetics (drugs that reduce or prevent uterine contraction) to prevent preterm birth of twins. 
When babies are born too early they can suffer from ill health, which is sometimes severe and very occasionally babies die. This may be due to their lungs and other organs not being mature enough. The problems related to preterm birth may also result in long‐term disabilities including cerebral palsy. Twins are more likely to be born early, have intrauterine growth restriction, and suffer from these problems. Drugs that reduce labour contractions (betamimetics) have been found to delay preterm birth when the mothers are carrying a single baby. However, this review of six trials (374 twin pregnancies) with only five trials (344 twin pregnancies) contributing data, found insufficient evidence to support the routine use of oral betamimetics. The results of two small studies suggested that betamimetics can reduce the incidence of preterm labour, but the results from four trials did not show a reduction in preterm births at less than 34 or 37 weeks' gestation. There was no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reducing the number of low‐ or small‐for‐gestational age babies or deaths in newborns. The difference in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome with betamimetics was not clear. Betamimetic drugs can cause maternal adverse effects such as heart palpitations, although this was not reported in the included trials. The quality of evidence is low because there were small numbers of participants and few outcomes in the included trials.
