Replacing FSH by hCG to complete follicular growth in women undergoing assisted reproduction
Follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) ‐ a relatively expensive drug ‐ is commonly used for several days to stimulate the ovaries of women undergoing assisted reproduction. Initial studies have shown that after a few days of using FSH to stimulate the ovaries, it can be replaced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is less expensive. In addition to cost reduction, this intervention has a theoretical potential to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS); though the underlying risk is already very low for most women. We searched the medical literature on in February 2013 for studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of using low‐dose hCG to replace FSH during the late follicular phase in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproduction, compared to the use of a conventional COH protocol. Five studies evaluating 351 women were included in this review. These studies were funded by fertility centres, universities, or both. We are very uncertain of the effect of this intervention on live birth, OHSS and miscarriage 
When use of low‐dose hCG to replace FSH was compared with conventional COH, there was very low quality evidence compatible with appreciable benefit, no effect or appreciable harm for the intervention, suggesting that for women with a 14% chance of achieving live birth using a conventional COH, the chance of achieving live birth using low‐dose hCG would be between 10% and 45%. Similarly, there was very low quality evidence suggesting that for women with a 3% risk of OHSS using a conventional COH, the risk using low‐dose hCG was also compatible with either benefit or harm, and would be between 0% and 4%.
