Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones 
Background 
The liver has various functions. Production of bile is one of these functions. The common bile duct (CBD) is the tube through which bile flows from the gallbladder (where bile is temporarily stored) into the small bowel. Stones in the CBD (CBD stones) can obstruct the flow of bile from the liver into the small bowel. Usually such stones are formed in the gallbladder and migrate into the CBD. Obstruction of the flow of bile can lead to jaundice (yellowish discolouration of skin and white of the eyes, and dark urine), infection of the bile duct (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can be life threatening. Various diagnostic tests can be performed to diagnose CBD stones. Depending upon the availability of resources, these stones are removed endoscopically (a tube inserted into the stomach and upper part of small bowel through mouth; usually the case), or may be removed as part of the laparoscopic operation (key hole surgery) or open operation performed to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy; it is important to remove the gallbladder since the stones continue to form in the gallbladder and can cause recurrent health problems). If the stones are removed endoscopically, presence of stones is confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (injection of dye into the CBD using an endoscope) before endoscopic removal of CBD stones. Alternatively, intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) (injection of dye into the biliary tree during an operation to remove the CBD stones, usually combined with an operation to remove gallstones) can be performed to detect CBD stones prior to operative removal of the stones. We performed a thorough search for studies that reported the accuracy of ERCP or IOC for the diagnosis of CBD stones. The evidence is current to September 2012.
