A new, non‐invasive diagnostic blood test — polymerase chain reaction — for people at risk of an invasive mould infection (aspergillosis) 
Review question We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA) among people with defective immune systems from medical treatment such as chemotherapy or following organ or bone marrow transplant. 
Background IA is a fungal disease caused by the widespread mould Aspergillus, with Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common species. Most people breathe in Aspergillus spores every day without becoming ill. However people with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing respiratory problems of the lungs and sinuses due to Aspergillus, ranging from allergic complications to IA, which is the most common life‐threatening, invasive fungal infection of people whose immune systems are compromised. Without antifungal treatment, most people with IA will die as a direct result of IA, so early diagnosis and prompt administration of appropriate antifungal treatment are both critical to the survival of these people. The ideal specimen for diagnosing IA would be lung tissue but obtaining this carries a significant risk to the patient so there is a clear need for new, non‐invasive methods such as PCR to demonstrate the fungus’s presence in blood by detecting its nucleic acids. 
Study characteristics We conducted our most recent search for studies in March 2018 and combined with an earlier search selected 29 clinical studies reporting the evaluation of PCR tests prospectively in cohorts of people at high risk of IA.
