Promoting cough in critically‐ill adults and children to enable removal of the breathing tube (extubation) and breathing without the machine (weaning) 
Background and importance 
Critically‐ill adults and children who need assistance from machines (ventilators) to help them breathe may have difficulty coughing and clearing secretions. This can reduce their chances of successful removal of the breathing tube (extubation) and being able to breathe without the machine. Their respiratory muscles may be weak; they may have neuromuscular disorders, spinal cord injury, or restrictive lung disease, or be experiencing delirium, cognitive impairment or additive effects of sedation. Techniques such as building up the volume of air in the lungs over a number of breaths (breathstacking), manually‐ and mechanically‐assisted cough with an insufflation‐exsufflation (MI‐E) device can be used to encourage people to cough. The potential for these techniques to help critically‐ill adults and children to come off and stay off the ventilator is unclear. 
Review question 
Do techniques that promote cough in mechanically‐ventilated, critically‐ill adults and children in a high‐intensity care setting improve rates of successful extubation and weaning? 
Review purpose 
To look at controlled studies of techniques to promote cough in critically‐ill adults and children, to see if these techniques are useful for helping them come off and stay off the ventilator, and to determine if there are any associated harms. The complications we looked for included decreased or increased blood pressure, irregular heart rhythm, leakage of air from the lungs to the chest cavity, coughing up blood, and mucus plugging requiring a new breathing tube.
