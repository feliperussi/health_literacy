Regional Cerebral Blood Flow SPECT for detection of Frontotemporal dementia in people with suspected dementia 
Background 
This review focused on one type of dementia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This neurodegenerative disease affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and accounts for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. People who have this disease may develop changes in their behaviour, speech or ability to plan. It is important to identify people with FTD correctly as the disease course and response to treatment differs from other dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. 
One test used by healthcare professionals to help make a diagnosis of FTD, is regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography (rCBF SPECT). This investigation allows visualisation of blood flow within the brain. In FTD it is thought that the pattern of blood flow to the brain can be used to tell the difference between FTD and other dementias. However, it is not clear whether using rCBF SPECT in this way improves our ability to make an accurate diagnosis of FTD. As all investigations come with a financial cost, it is important that their benefit is known. 
Aim: This review assessed the evidence regarding the accuracy of rCBF SPECT in detecting FTD in people with suspected dementia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched many databases for all papers with FTD and rCBF SPECT as their focus. These papers were reviewed independently by several researchers. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eleven studies including 299 individuals with FTD were available for this review. The studies were published over a 21‐year period, with a study size ranging from 27 to 363 participants, mainly recruited from University clinics, tertiary referral centres or memory clinics. Of the 11 studies, three used single‐headed (single detector) gamma cameras, a method no longer used in clinical practice today. Evidence is current to June 2013.
