The autogenic drainage breathing technique for helping people with cystic fibrosis to clear mucus from their airways 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis affects the lungs by producing thick mucus lining the airways. This can lead to infection and inflammation causing lung damage. Physiotherapy can help to keep the airways clear of mucus and there are many methods used to do this including breathing techniques, manual techniques and mechanical devices. Autogenic drainage is a very controlled technique of breathing which uses different depths and speeds of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways resulting in a spontaneous or voluntary cough. It can be used without help, but requires training, concentration and effort. We looked at the effect of using autogenic drainage on lung function measurements and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis, to discover whether using autogenic drainage was better or worse than other existing physiotherapy techniques for clearing the lungs.

Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies comparing at least two sessions of autogenic drainage with other breathing techniques and devices which help to clear the lungs of mucus. We included eight studies in the review involving 212 people with cystic fibrosis, aged between seven and 63 years of age. People were randomly selected for one physiotherapy treatment or the other. The number of people in the studies ranged from 4 to 75, and had a wide range of disease severity. The studies lasted from four days to two years in total.
