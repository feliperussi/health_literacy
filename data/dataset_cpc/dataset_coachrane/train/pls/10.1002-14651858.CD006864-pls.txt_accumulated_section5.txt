Balneotherapy or spa‐therapy for Osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of Balneotherapy (mineral baths) for Osteoarthritis (OA). The review shows that in people with OA: 
‐ Spending time in a mineral bath compared to no treatment may improve pain and quality of life.  ‐ Spending time in both a sulfur bath and a dead sea bath compared to no treatment may improve pain one month after treatment.  ‐ Spending time in a sulfur bath or a Dead Sea bath compared to no treatment may not lead to any difference in pain. 
There is not enough data to tell if spending time in mineral baths has any effect on a person's physical function or their quality of life.  How people felt overall and any side effects were not measured in these studies. 
What is osteoarthritis (OA) and what is balneotherapy?  Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints. When joints lose cartilage, the bone in your joints tries to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable.  Doctors used to think that osteoarthritis was caused by wear and tear on the cartilage. However, it's now thought that osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint. OA is one of the most common forms of arthritis and affects men and women equally. For many people OA is one of the main causes of long‐term disability.
