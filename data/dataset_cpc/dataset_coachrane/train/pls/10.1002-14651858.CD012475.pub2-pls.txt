Falls interventions in multiple sclerosis
Review question 
Do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who received interventions to reduce falls show better falls outcomes than those who received no treatment? In addition, do different types of falls interventions result in different outcomes for people with MS? 
Background 
Due to damage to the central nervous system among people with MS, difficulties in thinking, muscle strength, muscle tone, sensation, coordination and mobility can lead to an increased risk of falling, compared to people without MS. Interventions to prevent falls are offered to people with MS and often include: exercises, medication, surgery, management of urinary incontinence, fluid or nutrition therapy, psychological intervention, environment/assistive technology, environment (social environment), knowledge interventions and other interventions. The risk of falling in people with MS is three times higher than that in older people, yet it is unclear whether falls interventions are effective in reducing falls in MS. Currently there are a few good‐quality studies that have investigated the effectiveness of falls interventions in people with MS. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 13 studies with 839 participants involving various types of falls interventions, most comparing an exercise intervention with no intervention or two or more falls prevention interventions. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
There is uncertainty on the effect of exercises on prevention of falls due to the low to very low quality of the evidence for some of the primary outcomes. Our confidence in these results is low for the prevention of falls because this has been evaluated in only a few small trials that we judged as having some risk of bias and methodological shortcomings. There are still relatively few large, good‐quality studies to base our findings on, so more are needed.
