Type of electrical shock to restart the heart in a non‐hospitalised person whose heart stops beating 
Background 
When a person's heart stops beating it may be necessary to deliver an electrical shock (called 'defibrillation') to the person's chest to restart their heart. Two electrodes are placed on the person's chest to allow the defibrillator to deliver the electrical shock. Historically, the electrical current applied to the chest has travelled in one direction between the electrodes. More recently, defibrillators have been designed to send the electrical pulse in one direction and then in the reverse direction. This is known as a 'biphasic' waveform. 
Objective 
Cochrane researchers conducted this review to determine whether the newer biphasic waveform defibrillators are better at restarting a person's heart than the 'monophasic' waveform defibrillators previously used. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to 10 September 2014 and tried to find all available research (published and unpublished) that compared these two types of defibrillators. We only included trials with a high‐quality study design to avoid the possibility of inaccurate results. 
Key results 
Four trials (552 participants) met the inclusion criteria of our review. Several included trials were potentially at risk of misleading results due to features of their study design. When we combined these trial results, we found that using the newer biphasic waveform defibrillators may be associated with lower failure rates of restarting a person's heart, but these results were imprecise. There was no difference in the number of people who were alive on arrival at the hospital or who were discharged from the hospital alive. No included trials reported on side effects or operator safety. 
Conclusion 
We are uncertain as to whether biphasic defibrillators have an important effect on being able to restart a person's heart because the results were imprecise.
