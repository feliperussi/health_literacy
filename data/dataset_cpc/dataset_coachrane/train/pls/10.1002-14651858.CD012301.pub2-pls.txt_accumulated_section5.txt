Does extended‐field radiotherapy reduce death from locally advanced cervical cancer and what are the side effects? 
The issue Radiotherapy (RT) to the pelvis is used to treat cervical cancer. However, pelvic RT will not treat cancer that has spread to para‐aortic lymph nodes (lymph nodes lying along main blood vessels in the mid and upper stomach), since these are outside the target area (field) of RT. Extended‐field RT targets areas containing both pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes. Widening the RT field to include the para‐aortic area may reduce the risk of cancer returning. 
Chemotherapy is now normally given at the same time as RT for the treatment of cervical cancer (concurrent chemotherapy) and the combine treatment is called chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This is now standard treatment because studies have shown that addition of chemotherapy during RT improved survival for women with cervical cancer thought to be confined to the pelvis. Older studies, which compared treatments with pelvic RT alone, would not now be considered the standard of care for women well enough to have CRT. We cannot assume that results from studies which compared extended‐field RT with pelvic RT apply to modern CRT treatments. 
The aim of this review In women with locally advanced cervical cancer, does extending the RT field to cover the para‐aortic area reduce the risk of death from cervical cancer and what are the harms? 
Study characteristics We searched databases from their inception to August 2018 and found five studies that met the inclusion criteria. Three studies compared extended‐field RT versus pelvic RT. None of these three studies compared against the current gold‐standard of pelvic CRT. One study compared extended‐field RT versus pelvic CRT and one study compared extended‐field CRT versus pelvic CRT.
