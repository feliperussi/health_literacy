Alpha and beta dual receptor blockers for treatment of high blood pressure
Background 
Alpha and beta dual receptor blockers are a subclass of beta blockers which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure (BP). Drugs in this class include carvedilol (Coreg), labetalol (Trandate) and dilevalol (Unicard). We searched for and found all the relevant studies to examine how well this class of drugs lowered blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight clinical studies in October 2014, that examined the blood pressure lowering effect of carvedilol and labetalol in 1493 participants with high blood pressure. These people were randomly assigned to receive either a fixed dose of dual receptor blockers or a placebo for 3 to 12 weeks. 
Key results 
On average, dual receptor blockers lowered systolic BP by six points, diastolic BP by four points and heart rate by five beats per minute in patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure. There were more data on the effects of carvedilol. On average, carvedilol lowered systolic BP by four points and diastolic BP by three points. Higher doses of dual receptor blockers caused more slowing of heart rate but not more lowering of BP. The BP lowering effect of dual receptor blockers was less than other classes of BP lowering drugs. Patients taking dual receptor blockers were not more likely to withdraw from the study compared to patients taking placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was judged to be low due to various types of bias that could exaggerate the effect. A low quality of evidence means future research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
