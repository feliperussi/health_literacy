Aflibercept for neovascular age‐related macular degeneration
Review question  How well does aflibercept work, and how safe is it for the treatment of individuals with neovascular age‐related macular degeneration compared with other currently used treatments (ranibizumab and bevacizumab) or no treatment? 
Background  One cause of loss of sight in the center of the eye is a disease called age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD causes blindness in many older people in developed countries. Around the world, nearly 9% (one in 11) of people 45 to 85 years of age are estimated to have AMD. About 10% of people with AMD develop a type of AMD called neovascular (wet) AMD, which results from new blood vessels that develop in an inner layer of the eye called the choroid. If a patient with this type of AMD is not treated, the affected eye may lose sight and may develop other problems related to blindness. 
New blood vessels grow when they are signaled by a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF‐A). Medicines that block this protein, called anti‐VEGF drugs, are injected into the eye and have been shown to reduce fluid in the back of the eye while causing new blood vessels to slow down growth or to shrink. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were the most commonly used anti‐VEGF drugs from 2006 to 2011, when aflibercept became available. Aflibercept was created to bond more strongly with VEGF; therefore, aflibercept acts longer after an injection, so patients should need fewer injections of aflibercept than of ranibizumab or bevacizumab.
