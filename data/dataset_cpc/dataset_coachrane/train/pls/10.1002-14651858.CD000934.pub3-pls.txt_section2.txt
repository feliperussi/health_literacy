A routine number of visits for pregnant women has developed as part of antenatal or prenatal care without evidence of how much care is necessary to optimise the health of mothers and babies, and what is helpful for the women. These visits can include tests, education and other health checks. The review set out to compare studies where women receiving standard care were compared with women attending on a reduced number of occasions. We included seven randomised controlled trials involving more than 60,000 women. We assessed studies for risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence. The trials were carried out in both high‐income (four trials) and low‐ and middle‐income countries (three trials). In high‐income countries the number of visits was reduced to around eight. In lower‐income countries many women in the reduced visits group attended for care on fewer than five occasions, although the content of visits was altered so as to focus on specific goals. In this review there was no strong evidence of differences between groups receiving a reduced number of antenatal visits compared with standard care on the number of preterm births or low birthweight babies (moderate‐quality evidence). However, there was some evidence from these trials that in low‐ and middle‐income countries perinatal mortality may be increased with reduced visits (low‐quality evidence) although there may have been fewer admissions to neonatal intensive care but the evidence for this latter outcome was not strong. There was no clear difference between groups for our other primary outcomes including maternal death and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including pre‐eclampsia). There was evidence that women in all settings were less satisfied with the reduced schedule of visits; for some women the gap between visits was perceived as too long. Reduced visits may be associated with lower costs.
