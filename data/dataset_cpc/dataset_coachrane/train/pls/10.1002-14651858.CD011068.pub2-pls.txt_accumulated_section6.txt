Drugs given to pregnant women and their babies to keep them still during fetal surgery and other invasive procedures on the baby 
We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of anaesthetic and pain relief medication for preventing fetal movements (fetal immobilisation) to allow surgical and other invasive procedures to be performed safely on the unborn fetus whilst still in the mother's uterus.  
What is the issue? 
Use of ultrasound during pregnancy has made great advances resulting in increased diagnosis of problems with the development of unborn babies. Many structural fetal problems as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies can be treated while babies are still in the mother's uterus. Many problems generally require treatment before birth, for example a blockage in the airways. We set out to determine which medications are effective at providing fetal immobilisation for in‐utero procedures to be performed, as well as looking at the effect on the mother in terms of sedation and pain relief. For these procedures to be performed safely, fetal movements may need to be reduced. This can be done by giving medication either to the mother (usually by injection into a vein) or directly to the fetus (by injecting into fetal muscle). 
Why is this important? 
Treatment of structural issues such as lung or heart problems can greatly improve pregnancy and newborn outcomes. Similarly, with multiple pregnancy complications such as twin‐twin transfusion syndrome, where there is unequal sharing of the one placenta between the twins. Providing the best surgical conditions with reduced fetal movements means that the procedure can be performed safely and reduces complications such as preterm birth. It is also important to provide a safe environment for the mother without side effects such as oversedation or lack of pain relief during the procedure.
