Direct‐acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C
Background  Millions of people worldwide suffer from hepatitis C, which can lead to severe liver disease, liver cancer, and death. Numerous previous interferon‐based interventions have been used for hepatitis C, but none of these interventions have proven effective on patient‐centred outcomes and their use was associated with serious side‐effects. DAAs are relatively new but expensive interventions for hepatitis C, and preliminary results have shown that DAAs seem to eradicate hepatitis C virus from the blood (sustained virological response) much more frequently. In addition, these agents do appear to create much less serious adverse‐effects. In this Cochrane Review, we assessed the evidence on the clinical effects of DAAs for hepatitis C. 
Study characteristics  We included 138 randomised clinical trials. All included trials were at high risk of bias. The 138 trials used 51 different DAAs. Of these, 84 trials assessed DAAs on the market or under development; 57 trials were on DAAs withdrawn from development or the market. Trials were conducted from 2004 to 2016. The trials were from all over the world including 34 different countries. We included 17 trials where all the participants had previously been treated for hepatitis C (treatment‐experienced) before being included in the trial. There were 95 trials that included only participants who had not been previously treated for hepatitis C (treatment‐naive). The intervention periods ranged from one day to 48 weeks with an average of 14 weeks. The combined intervention period and follow‐up period ranged from one day to 120 weeks with an average of 34 weeks.
