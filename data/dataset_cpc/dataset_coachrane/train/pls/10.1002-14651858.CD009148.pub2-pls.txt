Management of reported decreased fetal movements during pregnancy
Decreased fetal movements can indicate deterioration in the baby's condition, for example, because of chronic placental insufficiency. Clinical observations indicate that mothers commonly perceive an absence or reduction in the baby's movements for some days before a baby's death. For this reason, fetal movement monitoring is advised by caregivers and is used spontaneously by mothers to assess the baby's well‐being. Women's perception of decreased fetal movement is decreased with cigarette smoking, maternal obesity and if the placenta is at the front of the womb. Management strategies in response to perceived decreased fetal movements include early delivery, expectant management with close surveillance of the baby, cardiotocography (visual or analysed by computer to follow the baby’s heart beat with uterine activity), ultrasound examination including Doppler ultrasound, and fetal arousal tests (either cardiotocographic or clinical observation where electronic fetal assessment methods are not available) to assess the baby’s well‐being. Evidence on the effectiveness of monitoring fetal movements and the subsequent management strategies in improving outcomes is limited. Given the high rate of false positive results for both fetal movement assessment and follow‐up tests, there is a real possibility of risks with unnecessary interventions or the baby being born premature and increased anxiety for the mother. 
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. This review found that very little is known from high‐quality randomised clinical trials to guide the management of reported decreased fetal movements. No randomised trials of management of decreased fetal movement alone were found. However, other systematic reviews indicate that Doppler ultrasound, computerised cardiotocography, and fetal arousal to facilitate cardiotocography show promise in high‐risk pregnancies.
