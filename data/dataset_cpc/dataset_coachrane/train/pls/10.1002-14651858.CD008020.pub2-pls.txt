Cord traction to deliver the afterbirth
The third stage of labour refers to the time between birth of the baby and complete expulsion of the placenta. Some degree of blood loss occurs after the birth of the baby as a result of this separation of the placenta. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal deaths in both high‐income and low‐income countries. 'Active management of the third stage of labour' refers to the processes of giving the mother a medicine (usually by injection) to help the womb to contract, clamping the baby's cord, and pulling on the cord while applying counter pressure to help deliver the placenta (controlled cord traction, CCT). It may be uncomfortable for the mother and may interfere with her preference for a natural birth process. Birth attendants need specific training to carry out CCT. 
This review of randomised controlled trials included three trials in women giving birth vaginally. The trials were methodologically good and findings were consistent. One of these trials was a large study conducted across eight countries, involving over 23,000 women, another was conducted in several sites in France involving over 4000 women and one was a single centre trial in Uruguay involving nearly 200 women. CCT did not clearly reduce severe PPH (blood loss > 1000 mL) but resulted in a small reduction in PPH (blood loss > 500 mL) and mean blood loss. It did reduce the risk of having to manually remove the placenta. Its use should be recommended if the care provider has the skills to administer CCT safely.
