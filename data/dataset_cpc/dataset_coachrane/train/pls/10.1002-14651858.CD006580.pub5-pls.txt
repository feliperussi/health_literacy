Culture‐specific programs for children and adults from minority groups who have asthma
Background 
People with asthma who come from minority groups have poorer asthma outcomes. Asthma education that is culturally specific may improve asthma‐related outcomes. 
Review question 
Do culture‐specific asthma education programmes (compared to generic asthma education programmes or usual care) improve asthma‐related outcomes in children and adults with asthma who belong to minority groups? 
What evidence did we find? 
Seven studies with 837 participants, aged from one to 63 years old were included in this review update. This review was limited by few studies and the quality of evidence was very low to low. In adults, we found that culture‐specific programmes did not improve any of our primary outcomes, but were better in improving quality of life (although the mean difference was less that the minimum important difference for the score) (secondary outcome). In children however, when data were combined from studies, culture‐specific programmes reduced severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (primary outcome), while single studies showed improved asthma control, asthma knowledge and adherence outcomes for our secondary outcomes. 
Conclusion 
The available evidence showed that culture‐specific education programmes for adults and children from minority groups are likely effective in improving asthma‐related outcomes. Although more robust evidence is required, asthma education programmes should be as culturally specific as possible in the context of chronic disease management and the complexity of health outcomes and culture, In the absence of any economic data, cost‐effectiveness studies are also required 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low to low for all outcomes.
