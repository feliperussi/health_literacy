Steroid implants for chronic uveitis not caused by infection
Background  Uveitis describes a group of eye diseases caused by inflammation (redness and swelling, etc.). Uveitis is the fifth most common cause of vision loss in high‐income countries, accounting for 5% (1 in 20 cases) to 20% (1 in 5 cases) of blindness, with the disease affecting mostly working‐age people. In low‐income countries, uveitis accounts for 2.4% (1 in 40 cases) to 24% (1 in 4 cases) of legal blindness. These figures are for all types of uveitis (infectious and non‐infectious uveitis), so the prevalence of non‐infectious uveitis (the focus of this review) is likely lower than these estimates. 
In this review, we were only able to focus on posterior uveitis, which occurs in a region in the back of the eye and may affect the choroid, retina, and/or vitreous. Posterior uveitis alone accounts for approximately 15% to 22% (1 in 4 to 6 cases) of uveitis cases and leads to approximately 10% (1 in 10 cases) of legal blindness in the United States. Posterior uveitis is primarily treated either with systemic (whole body, either by mouth or injection) or local (just near or inside the eye) medications that reduce inflammation, such as steroids. 
Review question  We compared steroid devices implanted directly into the eye with standard‐of‐care therapy for non‐infectious posterior uveitis. We examined whether the steroid implants were better at treating uveitis, had fewer side effects, or both, than standard‐of‐care therapy. 
Study characteristics  We included two randomized controlled trials that compared fluocinolone acetonide implants with standard‐of‐care therapy. These studies included 401 participants from Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States who were 6 years old or older and were followed for two years. The evidence is current to 6 November 2015.
