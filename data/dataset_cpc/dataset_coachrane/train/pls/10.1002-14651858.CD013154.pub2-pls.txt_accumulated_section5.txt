How effective are visual cycle modulators (a type of medicine) for preventing and treating geographic atrophy (a degenerative eye condition)? 
Why is this question important?Geographic atrophy is an eye condition that leads to progressive loss of central vision. It is an advanced form of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), a degenerative condition that usually develops in people over the age of 50. The condition affects the central part (macula) of the back of the eye (retina). There are two types of AMD: ‘wet’ and ‘dry’. In wet AMD, blood vessels in the eye leak, whereas in dry AMD they do not. Geographic atrophy is a late stage of dry AMD. 
Currently, we do not know how to prevent or treat vision loss caused by geographic atrophy. One potential treatment option is a type of medicine called a visual cycle modulator. Visual cycle modulators stop a toxic material (lipofuscin) from accumulating in the retina, and so they may be able to slow down vision loss in people with the condition. 
We conducted a review of the evidence from research studies to find out about the benefits and risks of visual cycle modulators for treating and preventing geographic atrophy. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low‐, low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty.
