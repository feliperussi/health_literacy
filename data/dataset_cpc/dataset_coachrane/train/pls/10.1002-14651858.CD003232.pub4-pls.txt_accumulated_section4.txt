Interventions for renal vasculitis in adults
What is the issue? Renal vasculitis is a rapidly progressing form of kidney disease that causes damage to the small structures (glomeruli) inside the kidneys that help filter waste and fluids from blood to form urine. The disease means a rapid loss of kidney function. Steroids and cyclophosphamide are recommended to help suppress the immune system. 
What did we do? We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 21 November 2019 for randomised controlled trials investigating any intervention for the treatment of renal vasculitis in adults. 
What did we find? Forty studies (3764 patients) were identified. Plasma exchange reduces the risk of end‚Äêstage kidney disease in patients presenting with severe acute kidney failure (AKI). The use of pulse cyclophosphamide results in good remission rates but there was an increased risk of relapse. Other appropriate induction agents include rituximab and mycophenolate. Azathioprine is effective as maintenance therapy once remission has been achieved. A lower dose of steroids is just as effective as high dose and may be safer, causing fewer infections. One study shows that a new complement inhibitor can be used to replace steroids in the initial treatment of vasculitis. These are early data. The drug is likely to be very expensive so its place in treatment is not yet clearly defined. Mycophenolate mofetil has also been tested in maintenance treatment and was found to result in a higher rate of disease relapse, when compared to Azathioprine. Methotrexate and leflunomide are useful in maintenance therapy but their relative effectiveness are not clearly defined. Patients on immunosuppression for up to four years after diagnosis have a lowered relapse rate to those in whom treatment is ceased by three years.
