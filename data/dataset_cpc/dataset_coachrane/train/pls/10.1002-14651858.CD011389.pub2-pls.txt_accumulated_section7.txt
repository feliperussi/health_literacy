Laparoscopic (key hole) operation versus open operation for treatment of people with stomach cancer 
Review question 
Is laparoscopic treatment (key hole surgery) equivalent to open surgical treatment for treatment of people with gastric (stomach) cancer? 
Background 
Stomach cancer is the third most frequent cause of cancer‐related death in the world. If cancer has not spread to other areas of the body, and if the person can withstand a major operation, depending upon the part of the stomach involved, removal of part of the stomach, or the entire stomach (gastrectomy), is the only treatment that offers long‐term cure of cancer. Gastrectomy can be performed by laparoscopic (key hole) operation, or by open operation, which involves a large cut. While the cut is smaller with key hole surgery, it is not clear whether key hole surgery is as safe as open surgery, and whether it offers any advantages in terms of quicker recovery of people undergoing gastrectomy. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies reported until September 2015 that compared laparoscopic and open gastrectomy in people with stomach cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 13 eligible studies (2794 participants) for this review. One trial did not report any information that we sought. Information on 213 participants was not reported because of various reasons, the common reason being that they did not receive the planned treatment. A total of 2528 participants received either laparoscopic gastrectomy (1288 participants) or open gastrectomy (1240 participants). The decision on whether a participant received laparoscopic or open gastrectomy was made using methods similar to the toss of a coin. This process ensures that the participants in the two groups are similar. All the participants were suitable for major surgery.
