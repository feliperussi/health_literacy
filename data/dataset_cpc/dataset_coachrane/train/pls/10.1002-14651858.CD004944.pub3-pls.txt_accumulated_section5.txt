Techniques for assisting difficult caesarean section
Caesarean section involves making an incision in the woman's abdomen and then cutting through the wall of the uterus. The baby is then born through these incisions. Numerous different ways have been suggested to facilitate the birth of the baby at difficult caesarean section and reduce the risk of injury to the baby, such as fractures and nerve damage. Some situations increase the likelihood of injury to mother and baby, especially if the woman has been in labour a long time or the baby's head is deep in the mother's pelvis. 
This review includes a total of seven studies, involving 582 women and examines which techniques are safest for mother and baby. The risk of bias in trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing the methods of randomisation. 
At an emergency caesarean after a long labour, there is evidence from the developing world that delivery of the buttocks or feet of the baby first (reverse breech extraction) is safer than delivery of the head by pushing from the vagina back into the uterus. In four trials involving 357 women, delivery of the buttocks or feet first was associated with fewer adverse outcomes for the mother, including less bleeding, infection and a shorter operation duration. There was no significant difference in trauma to the baby but admission to special care or neonatal intensive care was decreased with delivery of the buttocks or feet first than when the head was pushed up from the vagina. 
At a planned, non‚Äêlabouring caesarean section there is limited evidence to support techniques (forceps or vacuum extractor on the baby's head) other than the use of the surgeon's hands to deliver the head of the baby through the uterine incision. Two trials involving 128 women compared forceps/vacuum with manual delivery without any significance difference in outcomes.
