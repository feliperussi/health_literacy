Treatments for neuropathic pain in persons with sickle cell disease
Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of drug, or other therapies, for treating pain due to nerve damage (neuropathic pain) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). 
Background 
Pain is the most common complication of SCD. Some of this pain may be due to damage to nerves and this pain needs to be treated differently from the usual sickle cell pain. The usual medications such as ibuprofen or morphine may not be effective in managing this nerve pain. This trial aimed to examine how safe and effective medications or other alternative treatments are for nerve pain in people with SCD. 
Search date The evidence is current to: 31 January 2019. 
Study characteristics After a detailed search of scientific literature, we identified one trial that was eligible for inclusion. In this trial people with SCD who were diagnosed to have neuropathic pain were randomly put into groups to take either a drug named pregabalin or a placebo (no active medication) treatment. 
Key results The trial was conducted in the USA and included 22 participants with SCD, with 11 people in the pregabalin group and 11 in the placebo drug group. Assessments were measured at baseline and monthly for three months. 
Self‐reported neuropathic pain relief and quality of life scores (Short Form‐36) were no different between the pregabalin and placebo groups. The outcomes of time to improvement of symptoms and changes in sleep quality were not measured in the included trial. Few unwanted effects were noted and the numbers of these were not different between participants who were given pregabalin versus those given placebo.
