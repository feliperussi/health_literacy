Video games for schizophrenia
Review question 
Are video games an effective treatment (on their own or as an add‐on) for improving the well‐being and functioning of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects people worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have a distorted view of reality ‐ perceiving things that are not present (hallucinations) and believing things that are not true (delusions). People with schizophrenia may struggle to motivate themselves, experience anxiety and depression, and encounter cognitive symptoms, often struggling to stay focused on day‐to‐day activities and becoming disorientated. Hallucinations and delusions are usually treated with antipsychotic medications, whereas other symptoms can be difficult to manage with medication alone. 
Psychological therapies are sometimes used alongside medication to help with some symptoms of schizophrenia, however these therapies can be complex and expensive. Video games are a relatively inexpensive, and, for many, engaging treatment. They have been suggested to help improve the cognitive impairments such as lack of focus or poor memory that people with schizophrenia often experience. If effective, video games could provide a simple and relatively low‐cost additional treatment for people with schizophrenia. 
Searching 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving people with schizophrenia receiving either a video game intervention or other type of treatment such as talking (cognitive) therapy or placebo (dummy treatment). We performed the searches in March 2017, August 2018, and August 2019.
