Education about family planning for women who have just given birth
Counseling about family planning is standard for most women who just gave birth. Few providers and researchers have looked at how well the counseling works. We do not know if postpartum women want to use family planning or whether they will return to a health provider for birth control advice. Women may wish to discuss family planning before they have the baby and after they leave the hospital. Women may also prefer to talk about birth control along with other health issues. In this review, we looked at the effects of educational programs about family planning for women who just had a baby. 
Through June 2015, we searched for trials of education about family planning after having a baby. We also wrote to researchers to find other trials. The trials had to study how much the program affected family planning use. The program must have occurred within a month after the birth. We entered the data into RevMan and used the odds ratio to examine effect. We also looked at the quality of the research methods. 
We found 12 trials with 4145 women. Eight studies were from the USA and the others were from Australia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Syria. Four trials provided one counseling session before hospital discharge. Of eight studies with more than one contact, five focused on teens. Three of the five had home visiting, one used clinic services, and one had personal and phone contacts. Of three studies with women and teens, two had home visits and one used phone contact.
