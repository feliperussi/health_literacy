Surgical interventions for treating radial head fractures in adults
The radial head is located at the upper end of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. Radial head fractures are the most common fractures of the elbow in adults. These can severely affect the function of the elbow. Less serious fractures are generally treated without surgery and the more severe fractures with surgery. There are three main types of surgery. One is resection, where the fractured radial head is removed. Another type is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), where the fractured bone is put back into position and fixed in place by various devices such as screws. The third type of surgery is radial head replacement or arthroplasty, where the radial head is replaced by a metal implant. There is uncertainty and controversy about when surgery is needed as well as what type of surgical intervention is best. 
This review includes evidence from three randomised controlled trials with a total of 251 participants. All three trials were at some risk of bias, which means that their results may not be reliable. 
Two trials compared radial head replacement with ORIF for treating highly fragmented radial head fractures. These trials showed that after radial head replacement, patients had significantly better elbow function and fewer adverse events than those treated with ORIF at between one and three years follow‚Äêup. 
One trial compared biodegradable pins with standard metal screws in treating displaced radial head fractures. It found similar results for the two types of materials in terms of elbow function and adverse events.
