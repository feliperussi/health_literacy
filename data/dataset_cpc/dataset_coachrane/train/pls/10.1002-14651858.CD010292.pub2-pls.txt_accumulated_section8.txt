Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors for fibromyalgia
Bottom line 
Duloxetine and milnacipran may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia. However, some of these people may also experience side effects, such as nausea (feeling sick) and drowsiness. A minority of people with fibromyalgia experience symptom relief without side effects from duloxetine and milnacipran. 
Background 
People with fibromyalgia often have chronic (longer than three months) widespread pain, as well as problems with sleep, thinking and exhaustion. They often report poor health‐related quality of life. There is no cure for fibromyalgia at present, so the treatments aim to relieve the symptoms and to improve health‐related quality of life. 
Serotonin and noradrenaline are chemicals which are produced by the human body, involved in the regulation of pain, sleep and mood. Low concentrations of serotonin have been reported in people with fibromyalgia. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are a class of antidepressants that increase the concentration of serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain. 
Study characteristics 
In August 2017, we updated our searches for clinical trials in which SNRIs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. We found eight new studies since the previous version of the review. In total, we found 18 studies with 7903 participants. The studies were four to 27 weeks long and compared the SNRIs desvenlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran against a fake medication (placebo). We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results.
