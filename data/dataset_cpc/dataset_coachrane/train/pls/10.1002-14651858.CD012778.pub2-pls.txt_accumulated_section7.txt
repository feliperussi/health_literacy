Nasal continuous positive airway pressure levels for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
Review question 
How does giving preterm infants low versus moderate‐high levels of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) impact important health outcomes? 
Background 
Preterm infants are born earlier than expected. Compared to term infants, preterm infants have immature lungs that are at risk of partial collapse. This collapse makes it difficult for the lungs to bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide from the body. In response, such infants are commonly treated with nasal CPAP, a therapy that maintains a positive pressure against the airways in an effort to keep the lungs open and to prevent respiratory failure. The pressure is applied through a mask or prongs attached to the nose. Nasal CPAP may be used upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit as the initial respiratory support and also after a period of mechanical ventilation (use of a breathing machine) and extubation (removal of a breathing tube). Medical providers choose how much pressure to give. The amount of pressure is referred to as the CPAP level, which is measured in units of centimeters of water (cm H2O). Both not enough and too much pressure can be harmful, and it remains uncertain which CPAP pressure levels lead to the best outcomes. We performed a comprehensive search of the medical literature to summarize the impact of using low (≤ 5 cm H2O) versus moderate‐high (> 5 cm H2O) initial CPAP pressure levels in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
The search is up‐to‐date through 6 November 2020. We included 11 studies in the review. Four studies reported health outcomes that we had pre‐selected as being relevant to nasal CPAP levels and to the overall health of preterm infants, while the remaining studies reported short‐term physiological outcomes such as oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood pressure.
