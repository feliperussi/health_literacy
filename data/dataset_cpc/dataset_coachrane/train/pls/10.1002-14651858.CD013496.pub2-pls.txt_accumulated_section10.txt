Does limiting the times you eat (intermittent fasting) prevent cardiovascular disease?
What is cardiovascular disease? 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Smoking, diabetes and being overweight are risk factors for CVD, which means that they increase your chances of developing CVD. CVD can often be prevented by a healthy lifestyle, such as keeping to a healthy weight or losing weight if you need to. 
Following a diet 
Some people choose to lose weight by following a diet; for example, by eating less fat, or by reducing the number of calories they eat. Intermittent fasting is a type of diet involving patterns of eating and fasting (not eating foods); it does not limit what foods you eat, but limits when you can eat them. Eating patterns in intermittent fasting include: fasting for one or two days each week; fasting every other day; or eating only during certain hours and fasting for at least 12 hours every day. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Diets that involve intermittent fasting are becoming popular. We wanted to find out if intermittent fasting could reduce or prevent CVD. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested intermittent fasting against 'usual eating' (someone eats whatever foods they want whenever they like), or against 'energy restriction' diets (someone limits the number of calories they eat). 
We wanted to find out whether intermittent fasting affected mortality, cardiovascular mortality, risk of stroke, heart attack or heart failure. We also looked at whether intermittent fasting affected body weight and blood sugar levels.
