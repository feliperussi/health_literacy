Topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It differs from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are usually not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat epilepsy or depression can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Other possible treatments include the use of local anaesthetic applied to the skin. 
Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic. It is available in plasters (or patches), sprays, and creams, as topical lidocaine. These contain high concentrations of lidocaine because it crosses the skin poorly. Treatment with plasters usually involves applying one, two, or three plasters for up to 12 hours a day. 
In July 2014 we performed searches to look for clinical trials where topical lidocaine was used to treat neuropathic pain. We found 12 small studies of modest quality that tested topical lidocaine against topical placebo for a number of weeks. One study also tested a cream containing amitriptyline, which is an antidepressant. The 508 people in the studies had different types of neuropathic pain, with pain after herpes zoster infection the most common. 
There was some indication that topical lidocaine was beneficial in these studies (very low quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect of lidocaine on the incidence of adverse events or withdrawals (very low quality evidence). 
A number of studies of topical lidocaine in neuropathic pain are ongoing. Several are large and of long duration. They will be of great help in working out the benefits of topical lidocaine when they are completed and results can be incorporated in this review.
