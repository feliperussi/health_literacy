Do psychological and social interventions prevent mental health disorders in low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by humanitarian crises? 
Mental health during a humanitarian crisis 
A humanitarian crisis is an event, or series of events, that threaten the health, safety, security or well‐being of a community or large group of people, usually over a wide area. Examples include: wars, famine, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. 
People living through a humanitarian crisis may experience physical and mental distress that make them vulnerable to developing mental health disorders. These include post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. 
What are psychological and social interventions? 
Psychological interventions of a preventive nature usually offer people support and practical help to develop ways of coping, a sense of hope, and focus on building resilience. Social interventions of a preventive nature usually aim to strengthen social support systems and help people to feel more connected. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know if psychological and social interventions (psychosocial interventions) could help to stop mental health disorders developing in people living through humanitarian crises in low‐ and middle‐income countries. We were interested in: 
1)·how many people developed a mental health disorder after taking part in an intervention; and 
2) how many people dropped out of a programme or had unwanted effects related to the intervention. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the preventive effects of psychosocial interventions on people's mental health in low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the interventions people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of an intervention.
