Ibuprofen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2010 (Rabbie 2010); no new studies were found. A single oral dose of ibuprofen 200 mg or 400 mg is effective in relieving pain in migraine headaches. Pain will be reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in just over 1 in 4 people (26%) taking ibuprofen 400 mg, compared with about 1 in 10 (12%) taking placebo. It will be reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in roughly 1 in 2 people (57%) taking ibuprofen compared with approximately 1 in 4 (25%) taking placebo. Of those who experience effective headache relief at two hours, more have that relief sustained over 24 hours with ibuprofen than with placebo. A 200‐mg dose is slightly less effective, while soluble formulations give more rapid responses. A single 400‐mg dose of ibuprofen has efficacy similar to that shown for a single dose of 1000 mg aspirin in a separate Cochrane review (Kirthi 2013). 
Adverse events are mostly mild and transient, occurring in the same proportion of participants treated with ibuprofen and placebo. Very few individuals had serious adverse events or needed to withdraw from these studies because of adverse events. 
There is no information for ibuprofen combined with a self‐administered antiemetic, and little information comparing ibuprofen with other medications. There were no significant differences between ibuprofen 400 mg and rofecoxib 25 mg (now withdrawn) for 2‐hour headache relief, 24‐hour sustained headache relief, or use of rescue medication.
