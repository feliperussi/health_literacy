Is siponimod an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) and does it cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
· We don’t know whether siponimod is an effective treatment for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). At a dose of 2 mg once a day, siponimod may reduce recurrence of symptoms (relapse, calculated as an annual rate) after six months of treatment and may reduce the number of participants whose disability worsens after three months of treatment. 
· We don’t know if siponimod causes unwanted effects because studies did not last long enough to fully assess them. 
· Future studies should last longer in order to monitor unwanted and beneficial effects of siponimod better, and should use more robust methods. They should compare siponimod with other medicines. 
What is multiple sclerosis? 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition caused when the body’s immune system – which defends the body against disease and infection – mistakenly attacks parts of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms include problems with balance and walking, and blurred vision. MS is a lifelong condition that can cause serious disability. Some people’s symptoms may develop gradually. However, most people experience ‘attacks’ when new symptoms develop or existing symptoms worsen (called ‘relapse’), followed by periods with no changes to their symptoms (called ‘remittance’). This type of MS is called ‘relapsing remitting’ MS. Eventually, the course of their MS may change. These periods when there are no symptoms, or no worsening of symptoms, may stop and then symptoms may worsen continually. This is called ‘secondary progressive MS’. 
How does siponimod work? 
Siponimod is a medicine that attaches to the white blood cells (lymphocytes) that attack the central nervous system. This causes the lymphocytes to stay in the lymph glands instead of circulating in the blood to the brain. Fewer lymphocytes reach the brain so the attack by the immune system is reduced. Siponimod is a tablet taken once a day. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if siponimod is an effective treatment for MS and whether it causes any unwanted effects. 
We were interested in the number of people:
· who experienced relapses;
· whose disability worsened;
· who left the studies because of unwanted effects of siponimod;
· who developed new or larger brain lesions (damage to the brain); and
· who experienced serious unwanted effects, and which unwanted effects they experienced.
What did we do?We searched for studies that investigated siponimod compared with placebo (a sham medicine that looks and tastes the same as siponimod but with no active ingredients) or another medicine to treat MS. Studies could investigate siponimod alone or combined with another treatment, at any dose over any length of time. Participants had to be aged over 18 years, with confirmed MS. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
