Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in pregnancy when there are no symptoms
What is the issue? 
Can giving antibiotics to pregnant women who have a urinary infection but no symptoms improve the outcomes for women and their babies? 
Why is this important? 
A bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection (asymptomatic bacteriuria) occurs in a number (2% to 15%) of pregnancies. Because of the changes happening in their body, pregnant women are more likely to develop a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) if they have a urinary infection. The infection may also contribute to a baby who is born preterm (before 37 weeks), or at a low birthweight (weighs less than 2500 g (5.5 pounds)). 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 15 randomised controlled studies involving over 2000 pregnant women with urinary infections, but no symptoms. Antibiotics may be effective in reducing the incidence of kidney infection in the mother (12 studies, 2017 women) and clearing the infection from the urine (four studies, 596 women). They may also reduce the incidence of preterm births (three studies, 327 women) and low birthweight babies (six studies, 1437 babies). None of the studies adequately assessed any adverse effects of antibiotic treatment for the mother or her baby, and often the way the study was done was not well described. 
We assessed the three main outcomes with the GRADE approach, and found low‚Äêcertainty evidence that antibiotic treatment may prevent pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g. 
What does this mean? 
Antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of kidney infections in pregnant women who have a urine infection but show no symptoms of infection. Antibiotics may also reduce the chance a baby will be born too early or have a low birthweight. However, because of the low certainty of the evidence, it is difficult to draw conclusions; more research is needed.
