Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth 
Review question 
We carried out this review, through Cochrane Oral Health, to find out whether impacted wisdom teeth in teenagers or adults should be removed if they are not causing any problems or they should be left alone and checked at regular intervals. This is an update of a review first published in 2012 and first updated in 2016. 
Background 
Wisdom teeth (also known as third molars) generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 26 years. They are the last teeth to come in, and normally erupt into a position closely behind the last standing teeth (second molars). Space for wisdom teeth can be limited and so they often fail to erupt or erupt only partially, because of impaction of the wisdom teeth against the teeth directly in front. In most cases, this occurs when second molars are blocking the path of eruption of third molar teeth and act as a physical barrier, preventing complete eruption. An impacted wisdom tooth is called 'asymptomatic' and 'disease‐free' if there are no signs or symptoms of disease affecting the wisdom tooth or nearby structures. 
Impacted wisdom teeth can cause swelling and ulceration of the gums around the wisdom teeth, damage to the roots of second molars, decay in second molars, gum and bone disease around second molars and development of cysts or tumours. It is generally agreed that removing wisdom teeth is appropriate if signs or symptoms of disease related to the wisdom teeth are present, but there is less agreement about how asymptomatic disease‐free impacted wisdom teeth should be managed.
