Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension 
Background 
Hypertension, or persistent high blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg, is a prevalent risk factor that is associated with strokes and heart disease. To prevent these events, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used widely to treat hypertension, with ARBs often substituted for ACE inhibitors due to a reputation of having fewer side effects. However, while studies have shown a preventive benefit for ACE inhibitors, there are no such studies for ARBs. Therefore, we aimed to further test this substitution by reviewing studies that directly compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with uncontrolled or controlled hypertension with or without other risk factors (an aspect of a person's condition, lifestyle or environment that affects the probability of occurrence of a disease). The evidence is current to July 2014. 
Key results 
We found no reliable difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total deaths, deaths due to heart disease, or total heart disease and stroke. However, our conclusions alone cannot be taken to mean that ARBs would show similar benefit like ACE inhibitors if compared with placebo (a dummy treatment). ARBs do have a 1.8% lower chance of being stopped due to side effects over 4.1 years, meaning that for every 55 people treated with an ARB instead of an ACE inhibitor for 4.1 years, one person would be spared from a side effect leading to stopping the drug. This difference in side effects was mainly due to a higher rate of dry cough in people taking ACE inhibitors.
