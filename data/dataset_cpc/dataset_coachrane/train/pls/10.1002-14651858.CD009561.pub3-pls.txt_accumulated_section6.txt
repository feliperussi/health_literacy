Artificial corneal devices versus human donor corneas for people undergoing repeat corneal transplantation 
What is the aim of the review?The aim of this Cochrane Review was to compare the effectiveness and safety of artificial corneal devices versus donor (human) corneas in people who had at least one donor cornea transplant that had failed. 
Key messagesThe optimal management for people who have failed a donor corneal transplantation is unknown. 
What was studied in the review?There are several types of corneal transplants. The type of transplantation is defined by how much of the cornea is removed and replaced. Removal and complete replacement of the entire cornea is known as a full thickness penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Removing part of the cornea with replacement of the same part from a donor is based on the parts transplanted (e.g. endothelial keratoplasty refers to transplantation of the inner or endothelial layers of the cornea). Corneal transplantation is one of the most successful transplantations. However, sometimes the transplantation fails and the donor tissue becomes cloudy. No current guidelines are available as to how many donor corneal transplants can be performed in an eye that has failed a previous donor corneal transplantation. 
Corneal transplantation with either a donor cornea or an artificial cornea (known as a keratoprosthesis) involves removal of the cloudy cornea and replacement with a clear cornea or corneal device. Some examples of keratoprostheses (KPro) are the Boston KPro (Types I and II), AlphaCor, osteo‐odonto‐keratoprosthesis, and Fyodorov‐Zuev KPro. 
What are the main results of the review?We found no randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials in this review. There is no high‐quality evidence to guide surgeons and patients as to the best treatment to use after failure of a donor transplant. A trial comparing the use of artificial versus human donor corneas after PK failure is therefore needed.
