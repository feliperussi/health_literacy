Medication for treating anxiety disorders in people with alcohol use problems
Who may be interested in this review? 
People with anxiety disorders and alcohol use problems, as well as their healthcare providers. 
Why is this review important? 
People with anxiety disorders often also abuse alcohol or have alcohol dependence. All anxiety disorders involve long‐lasting and excessive fear, and can be classified according to the cause of the fear: generalized anxiety disorder (everyday situations), obsessive‐compulsive disorder (repetitive thoughts and behaviours), panic disorder (panic attacks), post‐traumatic stress disorder (previous traumatic events), social anxiety disorder (negative judgements by others) and specific phobia (specific objects or situations). When people with anxiety disorders abuse or are dependent on alcohol, they may be more disabled and difficult to treat than when they have either condition on its own. Psychotherapy is most often used in treating anxiety disorders in people with alcohol use problems. In psychotherapy people are encouraged to explore their feelings, moods, behaviours, thoughts and reactions to the cause of their anxiety. Psychotherapy does not always work though, so it is important to test whether medications are an effective treatment option. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
We wanted to find out whether medication is effective in treating people with both anxiety disorders and alcohol use problems. For this reason, we systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medication in treating people with both disorders. RCTs provide a more accurate measure of the effectiveness of medication by making sure that people in the study have an equal chance of being treated with medication or placebo.
