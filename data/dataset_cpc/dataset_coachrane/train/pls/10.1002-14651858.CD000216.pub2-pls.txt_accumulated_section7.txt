Repeated lumbar or ventricular taps in newborns with intraventricular haemorrhage
Review question 
Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effect of removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via lumbar or ventricular puncture and draining CSF via a needle inserted into the base of the spine or into a fluid‐filled cavity in the brain on improving rates of disability, death, and the need for a permanent surgical procedure in preterm infants who have had bleeding inside the cavities of the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)). 
Background 
Babies that are born preterm are at risk of developing IVH. IVH can cause an excess of CSF to build up on the brain. The risk of this happening might be reduced by the removal of blood in the CSF via lumbar or ventricular taps. This might reduce the need for a permanent surgical procedure called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). VPS is problematic as it can easily become infected and often has to be replaced or repaired, which requires an operation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials up to 24 March 2016 that compared removing CSF via lumbar or ventricular taps in all babies at risk of developing a build‐up of fluid on the brain against a conservative approach where this was only done if there was evidence that the build‐up of fluid was causing an excess of pressure in the brain. We included four trials that included a total of 280 preterm infants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990.
