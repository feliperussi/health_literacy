Tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain
Bottom line 
No firm conclusions could be drawn about the effectiveness or harms of tramadol, alone or with paracetamol, in cancer pain. 
Background 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. 
Tramadol hydrochloride is an opioid analgesic available since 1977. In 2016, tramadol, alone or in combination with paracetamol, was available in products for oral use and by injection from almost 90 companies. Oral formulations include those designed for immediate release, and for modified release over a longer time. Preparations for rectal administration are also available. 
In this review, we set out to estimate how well tramadol worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were ‚Äê for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their tramadol. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we found 10 studies with 958 adult participants and no studies in children. The studies were often small and compared different tramadol preparations with different comparator drugs, and did not report important outcomes well. This made it difficult to work out whether tramadol was as good or better or worse than any other drug for cancer pain. 
Key findings 
No firm conclusions could be drawn for any outcome in any comparison. Tramadol may not be as good as morphine. 
Quality of evidence 
We judged all the evidence available to be of very low quality. This means that the research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect.
