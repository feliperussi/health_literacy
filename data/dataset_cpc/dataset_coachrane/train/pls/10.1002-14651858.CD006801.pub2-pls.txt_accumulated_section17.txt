Custom‐made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain 
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of custom‐made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain; 
The review shows that in adults who have had painful pes cavus (high arch), for more than one month custom foot orthoses: 
Decreases foot pain after 3 months compared with fake foot orthoses.
The review shows that for people at least 5 years of age and diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), custom foot orthoses: 
Reduce foot pain after 3 months compared with supportive shoes, but do not reduce foot pain after 3 months compared with using prefabricated neoprene shoe inserts. 
The review shows that in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), custom foot orthoses: 
Reduce rearfoot pain after 3 months, compared with doing nothing, but do not reduce foot pain after 3 years, compared with using fake foot orthoses. 
May not reduce pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint (where the big toe meets the foot) after 6 weeks or 3 months any more than wearing supportive shoes or using soft non‐custom foot orthoses. 
The review shows that for people diagnosed with plantar fasciitis (heel pain), custom foot orthoses: 
May not reduce foot pain after 3 or 12 months any more than using fake foot orthoses
May not reduce foot pain after 6 weeks or 3 months any more than using night splints to hold your feet in a stretched position while you sleep.  However, using custom foot orthoses and night splints together may reduce foot pain. 
May not reduce foot pain after 2‐3 months or 1 year any more than non‐custom foot orthoses 
May not reduce foot pain after 6‐8 weeks when used along with a program of stretching exercises or night splints. 
May not reduce foot pain after 2 weeks any more than a combined treatment of manipulation, mobilisation and stretching. 
This review shows that for people younger than 60 years of age with painful hallux vagus (a condition where the base of the big toe bulges out sideways, away from the foot) custom‐made foot orthoses: 
Reduce foot pain after 6 months compared to no treatment, but may not reduce foot pain after 6 or 12 months compared to surgery.
