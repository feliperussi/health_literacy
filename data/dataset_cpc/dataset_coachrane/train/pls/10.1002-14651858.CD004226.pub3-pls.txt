Antenatal interventions for fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
The optimal management of pregnant women with a previous child affected by fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia remains unclear. 
Differences between the platelets of an unborn baby and their mother, because of a fetal platelet alloantigen inherited from the father and not shared by the mother, can lead to the development of antibodies in the mother. These attack the baby's platelets and can lead to bleeding complications for the baby. This is termed fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, meaning a reduction in the number of platelets in the baby’s blood because of their destruction by the mother's antibodies. The baby is at risk of bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage) before or shortly after birth and the baby may die or have long‐lasting problems. Fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia often occurs in the first pregnancy and is usually only diagnosed following the birth of a baby with a low platelet count. Active antenatal management to prevent severe thrombocytopenia is confined to those women who have had a previously affected infant.   Fetal blood sampling from the umbilical vein is used to monitor the fetal platelet count but carries a risk of fetal loss. Intrauterine platelet transfusions are also associated with a risk of fetal loss and are now only used as treatment for women who do not respond to medical treatment. Medication is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with or without immunosuppression with corticosteroids. The four small trials (n = 206) provide insufficient evidence to determine the best treatment for fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.
