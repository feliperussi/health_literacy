Acupuncture as a treatment for people with glaucoma
What was the aim of this review? This review aimed to assess whether acupuncture is useful and safe in treating people with glaucoma. We included in the review three completed trials and one ongoing trial. 
What is the key message of this review? At this time, it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from available data to support the use of acupuncture for treatment of people with glaucoma. 
What was studied in the review? Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve and affects visual function. It is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Although many treatments are available, including eye drops, laser treatment, and surgical procedures, some people may seek complementary or alternative medicine approaches such as acupuncture to supplement their regular treatment. 
What are the main results of the review? The three completed studies were conducted in hospitals in Taiwan and the United States. These trials recruited participants with glaucoma or intraocular hypertension (higher than normal eye pressure). The trials differ greatly in the interventions compared, including auricular acupressure (a non‐standard acupuncture technique), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and acupuncture on eye‐points (12 sessions). Acupuncture may have a very small effect in reducing eye pressure, but the certainty of evidence is very low. One trial reported needle sensitivity. Trials provided no evidence of effect on visual field or visual acuity. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? Cochrane Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to November 16, 2018.
