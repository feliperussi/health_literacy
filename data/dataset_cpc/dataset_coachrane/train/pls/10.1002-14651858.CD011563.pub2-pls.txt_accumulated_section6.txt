Mesh fixation techniques in ventral hernias
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of different techniques for fixing meshes (patches) in the belly wall in the course of ventral hernia repair. 
Background 
A hernia is a bulge or weakness, in which tissues or organs from inside the abdomen (the belly) can get trapped, and can cause discomfort and symptoms such as pain. The size of the hernia can be made worse by daily living activities, especially by coughing and straining. Hernias carry a risk of incarceration ( a hernia so occluded that it cannot be returned by manipulation)) and strangulation (when the circulation of blood has been cut off), which is a threat especially in incisional and umbilical hernias (navel area). An incisional hernia is a hernia that occurs through a previously‐made incision in the abdominal wall, i.e. the scar left from a previous surgical operation. The incision could have been made in order to get to an internal organ such as the appendix, or a caesarian section. 
Repair of a ventral (abdominal wall) hernia is done by surgery. The choice of the right surgical procedure will depend on different criteria, like size of the hernia, previous surgery, location of the hernia and general health. There are two types of surgery: Open surgery, where the hernia is closed by sewing the layers of the abdominal wall. Often, the surgeon places an additional mesh on a layer of the abdominal wall, which makes a recurrence of the hernia less likely. The other type is called laparoscopic surgery, where the surgeon makes a few small incisions and inserts tiny long instruments and a camera into the abdomen. For the laparoscopic repair of the hernia, a mesh has to be used in every patient.
