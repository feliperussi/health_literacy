Can inserting a cervical stitch prevent early births of single babies?
What is the issue? 
Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure performed during pregnancy to place a stitch around the neck of the womb (cervix). The stitch is aimed to support the cervix and reduce risk of an early birth. 
Why is this important? 
The cervix stays tightly closed until towards the end of normal pregnancies, before starting to shorten and gradually soften to prepare for labour and delivery. However, sometimes the cervix starts to shorten and widen too early, causing either late miscarriage or an early birth. Inserting a cervical stitch may reduce the chance of late miscarriage or early birth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence up to 30 June 2016. This review includes 15 studies involving 3490 women (3 studies involving 152 women were added for this update). 
Women with a stitch are less likely to have a baby who is born too early. Babies whose mothers had a stitch are also less likely to die during the first week of life. It is not clear whether a cervical stitch can prevent stillbirth or improve the baby's health once born. 
What does this mean? 
Inserting a stitch helps pregnant women who are at high risk avoid early births compared to no stitch. Inserting a stitch may also improve a baby's chance for survival. We found too few clinical trials to understand whether cervical stitch is more effective than other treatments for preventing early births, such as progesterone (a hormone drug used to prevent early birth). We found too few data to understand if it is better to have a stitch inserted early in pregnancy (based on the mother's previous history) or to wait to perform an ultrasound scan later in pregnancy to see if the cervix has become shortened.
