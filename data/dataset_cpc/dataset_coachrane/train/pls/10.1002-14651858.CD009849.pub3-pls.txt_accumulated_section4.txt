Hormonal birth control and fracture risk in observational studies
When bone mass declines with age, the risk of fractures increases. Birth control methods that have hormones may lead to changes in women’s bone density. Worry about fractures may limit the use of these effective methods. Observational studies can collect data on birth control use as well as fractures later in life. Through June 2015, we searched for such studies in several databases.  
We included studies that looked at hormonal birth control use and fracture risk. We examined the quality of research methods using a tool for observational studies. With these types of studies, investigators need to control for differences in the study groups. We used the results from adjusted analyses as reported. Where we did not have adjusted analysis, we used the odds ratio to look at differences between groups. 
We found 14 studies. Six of them had good quality results and looked at use of birth control pills. We did not find an overall difference in fracture risk for users and nonusers of birth control pills. One study found pill users were more likely to have fractures overall. Another had later data for a subset of those women. Pill use was not related to fracture risk except for 10 or more years since use. Still another study showed more risk when the woman had 10 or more prescriptions. When a study of postmenopausal women removed the women with prior fracture, pill users did not have higher fracture risk. Two more studies saw more fractures in pill users but only for certain subgroups.
