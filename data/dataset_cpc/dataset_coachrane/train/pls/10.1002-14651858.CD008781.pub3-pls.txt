Vigabatrin versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy
Review question 
This review is an update of a review previously published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012, Issue 1) titled 'Vigabatrin versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy'. We reviewed the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vigabatrin versus carbamazepine (CBZ) when used as monotherapy for epilepsy. We found five studies. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. The efficacy and safety of vigabatrin as an add‐on therapy for refractory epilepsy have been well established. However, this information needs to be weighed against the risk of development of visual field defects. We wanted to know whether vigabatrin monotherapy is effective and safe compared with the standard antiepileptic drug carbamazepine as monotherapy for epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 2015. We found five trials assessing vigabatrin or carbamazepine monotherapy for newly diagnosed epilepsy, which recruited a total of 734 participants between six months and 65 years of age. 
Key results 
Results of this review show no significant differences between vigabatrin and carbamazepine in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six‐month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation, but they reveal some clinical disadvantage with vigabatrin on time to first seizure. Taking vigabatrin was more likely to result in weight gain. A safety concern was the high prevalence of visual field defects, as reported in a systematic review of observational studies (Maguire 2010). 
Quality of the evidence 
One study was assessed as good quality and the other four as poor quality.
