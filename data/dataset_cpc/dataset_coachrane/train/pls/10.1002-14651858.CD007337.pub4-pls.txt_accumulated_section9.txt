Intra‚Äêperitoneal local anaesthetic administration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
Background 
Between 10% and 20% of the Western population are affected by gallstones. Annually, 1% to 4% of those will develop symptoms. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the main treatment of patients who develop symptomatic gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (keyhole surgery to remove of the gallbladder) is the preferred method of surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered less painful than open surgery. 
Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated that administration of local anaesthetic (drug that numbs part of the body) into the abdomen (tummy) is possibly effective and associated with low rates of serious adverse events. However, the evidence to support this is of very low quality. We carried out this review to update the evidence with recently published trials. 
Searching for studies and Study characteristics 
We searched medical literature databases to 19 January 2021. We searched reference lists of studies retrieved. We also searched other resources to identify unpublished or ongoing trials to 10 September 2021. 
We identified 85 completed trials, with 76 trials (4957 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy) contributing data to at least one of the outcomes. The majority of participants were fit and healthy and undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a planned basis. Participants were randomly assigned to receiving local anaesthetic (or not) to ensure the groups being compared were as similar as possible. 
Funding 
Seven trials received funding for their research from external bodies, of these three trials were assessed to be at risk of conflicts of interest. A further 17 trials declared no funding.
