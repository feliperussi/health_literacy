Proteins in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) for early prediction of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia in people with mild cognitive problems 
Background 
The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally. A diagnosis of dementia at early stage is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach. A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. In this review, we have focused on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic tests. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the accuracy of CSF tests in identifying those people presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 15 studies containing a total of 1282 participants with MCI. The majority of studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and 2013. The remaining six studies were published between 2004 and 2009. All of the included studies were conducted in Europe. 
Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 to 231 participants.The mean (range) age of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) and the mean (standard deviation) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, with a majority of studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient details given on how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established. According to the assessment of how the CSF tests were conducted and analysed, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality.
