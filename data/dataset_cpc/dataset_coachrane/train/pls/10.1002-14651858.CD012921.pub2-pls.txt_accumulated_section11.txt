Does random drug and alcohol testing prevent injuries in workers?
Background 
Workplace accidents and injuries happen more often when people's physical abilities and judgement are impaired by drugs or alcohol. The workplace is not usually a place where research is conducted. There are many factors that make it difficult for an employer to measure the impact of a workplace drug testing program on the overarching goal of ensuring a safe workplace. 
Some employers — particularly in sectors where safety is very important, such as the commercial driving and airline industries — choose to test workers randomly for drugs and alcohol (random drug and alcohol testing (RDAT)). Through such testing, employers hope to deter employees from inappropriate use of these substances. However, we do not know if RDAT produces the desired effect. 
Review question 
We wanted to know whether RDAT in the workplace prevents injuries and unplanned events that result in damage or loss of property (non‐injury accidents) compared with no RDAT. 
Search date 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 1 November 2020.
Study characteristics 
We wanted to include all of the relevant research about RDAT in the workplace in our review. We looked for different kinds of published studies that measured how RDAT affected workplace safety. We excluded research on RDAT in commercial drivers, because another Cochrane Review covering these studies has already been published. 
Two authors from our team examined all of the references identified by our search, but they found only one study that met our selection criteria and could be included in the review.
