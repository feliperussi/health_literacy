Dietary advice during pregnancy to prevent gestational diabetes
What is the issue? 
Can dietary advice for pregnant women prevent the development of diabetes in pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can cause health complications for women and their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure and protein in their urine during pregnancy (pre‐eclampsia), and of having a caesarean section birth. Their babies may grow large and, as a result, be injured at birth, or cause injury to their mothers during birth. Additionally, there can be long‐term health problems for women and their babies, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. The number of women being diagnosed with GDM is increasing around the world, so finding simple and cost‐effective ways to prevent women developing GDM is important. 
Carbohydrates are the main nutrient affecting blood glucose after meals. The glycaemic index (GI) can be used to characterise the capability of carbohydrate‐based foods to raise these levels. Some diets, for example, those with low‐fibre and high‐GI foods, can increase the risk of developing GDM. It has been suggested that dietary advice interventions in pregnancy may help to prevent women developing GDM. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies on 3 January 2016, and included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2786 pregnant women and their babies. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low and the overall risk of bias of the trials was unclear to moderate. Six trials compared dietary advice with standard care, four compared advice focused on a low‐GI diet with advice for a moderate‐ to high‐GI diet, and one compared dietary advice focused on a high‐fibre diet with standard advice.
