TEG and ROTEM for diagnosing trauma‑induced coagulopathy (disorder of the clotting system) in adult trauma patients with bleeding 
What is 'trauma‐induced coagulopathy'? 
Trauma‐induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a disorder of the blood clotting process that can occur soon after trauma injury that can lead to the patient bleeding to death. A diagnosis of TIC on admission to hospital is associated with increases in death rates, blood transfusions, risks of complications and length of stay in hospital. 
How is TIC diagnosed? 
Current testing for TIC normally involves coagulation tests on the patient's blood.
What are thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)? 
Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are tests which involve a group of assessments that can be used to diagnose TIC. In some centres TEG and ROTEM are used routinely to test patients' blood, but in the UK their use is usually restricted to experimental and research settings. 
The purpose of this research 
The purpose of this research was to determine how good the TEG and ROTEM assessments are at diagnosing TIC in adult trauma patients who are bleeding. The accuracy of TEG and ROTEM was compared against another test that is currently used (the reference standard), which was the prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PTr/INR). 
What we discovered 
We identified 3 studies (with 300, 90 and 40 participants; 430 in total) that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of TEG or ROTEM for identifying TIC in bleeding adult trauma patients within the emergency setting against PTr/INR. We recognise that the reference standards of PT and INR are imperfect, but in the absence of embedded clinical consensus these are judged to be the best reflection of current clinical practice. Readers should note that the assessment of test accuracy was not the single purpose of any of these 3 included studies.
