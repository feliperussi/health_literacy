The use of video devices in assisting the placement of breathing tube in babies
Review question 
Does placement of a breathing tube (intubation) using a video‐assisted device (videolaryngoscope) increase the success and safety of the procedure in newborn babies compared to the standard approach of looking at the opening of the airway (vocal cords) without video assistance (direct laryngoscopy)? 
Background 
One in 100 newborn babies may need intubation to sustain life when they have difficulty breathing. The placement of a breathing tube using direct laryngoscopy may be challenging in newborns. When teaching this life‐saving skill to trainees, supervisors rely mainly on the feedback from the trainee (junior colleague) rather than by visual confirmation. It is difficult for the supervisor to provide real‐time feedback to the trainee in this situation. Videolaryngoscopy may make this procedure easier and safer than the direct laryngoscopy approach. We wanted to discover whether using the videolaryngoscope increased the success and safety of the intubation procedure in newborns compared to the direct laryngoscopy technique. 
Study characteristics 
We sought evidence for the usefulness of these video‐assisted devices for the placement of breathing tubes in babies. We searched scientific databases for clinical trials of babies who needed intubation in the delivery room, operating room or intensive care unit. The studies could measure time to intubation, number of attempts at intubation, success rate of first intubation or side effects. The evidence is current to May 2017. We included three studies, which provided data on up to 467 intubation attempts in newborns by trainees.
