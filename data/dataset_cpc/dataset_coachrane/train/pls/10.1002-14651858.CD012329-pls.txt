Oxycodone for pain in fibromyalgia in adults
Bottom line 
There is no good evidence to support or refute the suggestion that oxycodone, alone or in combination with naloxone, reduces pain in fibromyalgia. 
Background 
Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder characterised by widespread pain, fatigue, poor sleep, low mood, and other bodily symptoms. Common pain‐relieving medicines such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are not usually considered effective. Opioid painkillers are commonly used to treat fibromyalgia, but there is uncertainty over how good they are. 
Opioid painkillers are drugs like morphine. Morphine is derived from plants, but many opioids are also made by chemical synthesis rather than being extracted from plants. Oxycodone is a semi‐synthetic opioid, manufactured from the opioid alkaloid thebaine, and is widely available. 
This review replaces part of a review originally published in 2014, which examined how well oxycodone worked in pain in fibromyalgia and some other medical conditions. In this review, we examined only pain in fibromyalgia. In the previous review, we did not find any evidence that oxycodone is, or is not, of value in treating pain in fibromyalgia. 
Study characteristics 
In July 2016, we searched for clinical trials where oxycodone, either alone or in a fixed‐dose combination with naloxone, was used to treat pain due to fibromyalgia in adults. We did not find any studies that met the requirements for this review. 
Key results 
There was no information from randomised controlled trials on the benefits or harms of oxycodone when used to treat pain in fibromyalgia. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as very low because there were no studies. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results.
