Population‐based interventions for reducing HIV infection
Community‐ or population‐based sexually transmitted infection control does not appear to be an effective HIV prevention strategy in most settings. In the early 1990s, improved STI treatment services were shown to reduce HIV incidence in northern Tanzania, in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic, where STI treatment services were poor and where STIs were highly prevalent. Subsequent trials, however, failed to confirm these findings and also failed to show a substantial benefit for community‐wide presumptive treatment for STIs. This is likely due to the endemic nature of HIV and relatively low incidence of STIs in these populations. There are, however, other good reasons as to why STI treatment services should be strengthened and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is applied and accepted in a community, it can improve the quality of services provided. The trial in Masaka District, Uganda showed an increase in the use of condoms, a marker for less risky sexual behaviours, although a newer study by Gregson conducted in Zimbabwe suggested no effect. With the last three trials having shown disappointing results with respect to HIV prevention, it is unlikely that further community trials will be conducted, let alone yield different results. Future trials of biomedical interventions that involve individual randomisation, however, may represent an opportunity to reexamine presumptive treatment of STIs. Such trials should also aim to measure a range of factors that include health‐seeking behaviour and quality of treatment, as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.
