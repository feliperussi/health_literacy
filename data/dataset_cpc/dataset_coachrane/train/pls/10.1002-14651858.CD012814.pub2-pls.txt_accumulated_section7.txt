Postoperative chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma that can be surgically removed
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (drugs administered after surgery, aiming to kill any cancer left after the operation) versus no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or another type or form of chemotherapy in people who underwent resection for cholangiocarcinoma (cancer in the bile ducts) with intent to cure. 
Background 
Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive tumour for which surgical resection is a mainstay of treatment. Bile ducts are the drainage 'pipes' that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder, and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Despite complete surgical removal (resection) of the cholangiocarcinoma, recurrences of tumour are common, leading to a poor prognosis for patients. It is thought that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (supplementary treatment after initial treatment) given after surgical resection may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence by eliminating residual cancer and micrometastatic lesions (microtumours that have spread from a cancer to distant areas of the body). The overall benefits and harms of this type of treatment are unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for published articles describing randomised clinical trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) to identify the role of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and found five studies with a total of 931 participants. Four studies (867 participants) compared surgery and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (mitomycin‐C and 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU); gemcitabine; gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin; or capecitabine) with surgery alone (no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy). One study (70 participants; 64 with cholangiocarcinoma and 6 with gallbladder carcinoma) compared surgery and a new adjuvant oral chemotherapy (S‐1) (fluoropyrimidine derivative) versus surgery and adjuvant gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy.
