Antioxidants as add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia
Antioxidants are substances that protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals (causing oxidative stress). It is well known that adding antioxidant‐rich fruits and vegetables to your daily diet will strengthen your ability to fight infection and disease. There is recent evidence that progressive brain changes take place as schizophrenia unfolds. Among many possible explanations, oxidative stress may be one of the factors contributing to the deterioration of the brain and its grey matter, leading to difficulties in people’s thinking and everyday functioning. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effect of antioxidants as an add‐on treatment to standard antipsychotic medication. In particular, by reducing (or lessening) psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse 
Searches for randomised trials were run in 2010 and 2012, review authors found 22 relevant trials that randomised a total of 2041 people with schizophrenia. The trials compared the effects of taking a variety of antioxidants (allopurinol, Ginkgo biloba, N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), selegiline, vitamins C and E) compared with placebo. Most results showed no real differences between the antioxidants and placebo although there was evidence Ginkgo biloba had a positive effect on psychotic symptoms in the short term. The quality of this evidence was moderate. 
However, overall, the trials suffered from a lack of real‐world outcomes, such as clinical response, rates of relapse, quality of life, functioning, safety and satisfaction or acceptability of treatment. Adverse effects were also poorly reported with some studies not providing any data for adverse effects. 
Ginkgo biloba and NAC emerged from the trials as the most promising, so should have priority in the design of future trials that are larger, longer and better reported than the 22 studies available at the present time.
