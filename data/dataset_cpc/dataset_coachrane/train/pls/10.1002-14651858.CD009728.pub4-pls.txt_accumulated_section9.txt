Healthy weight interventions for improving thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if healthy weight interventions can improve thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the key messages? 
This updated review provides some evidence that school programmes that encourage healthier child weight may also provide ‘co‐benefits’ of thinking skills and school performance. However, we need more high‐quality healthy‐weight interventions that test thinking skills and school performance, as well as health outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
The number of children and teenagers with obesity is high worldwide. Some children and teenagers with obesity have health issues or are bullied because of their body weight. These experiences have been linked to problems in performing well in school, where they tend to perform less well in thinking tasks such as problem‐solving. Physical activity and healthy eating benefit a healthy body weight and improve thinking skills and school performance in children with a healthy weight. Studies found that healthy‐weight interventions can reduce obesity in children and teenagers, but it is unknown if and how well healthy‐weight interventions can improve thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 18 studies which included a total of 2384 children and teenagers with obesity. Five studies assigned individual children to intervention or control groups. Thirteen studies allocated entire classes, school or school districts to the intervention and control group. Of the 18 studies, 11 involved children at primary/elementary‐school age. Eight studies offered physical activity interventions, seven studies combined physical activity programmes with healthy lifestyle education, and three studies offered dietary changes. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Seventeen studies had at least one flaw in how the study was done. This reduces the level of confidence we can have in the findings.
