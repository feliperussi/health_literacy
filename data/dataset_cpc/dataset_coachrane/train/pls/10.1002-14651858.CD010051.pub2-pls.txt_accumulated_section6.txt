Cyclosporine A eye drops for the treatment of dry eye
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if cyclosporine A (CsA) eye drops are helpful in the treatment of dry eye. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 30 studies. 
What is the key message of this review? It is unclear whether CsA eyedrops reduce the symptoms and signs of dry eye. People using CsA drops may experience adverse effects, such as burning or stinging. 
What was studied in the review? The surface of the eye is moist and covered with a thin layer of tears. When there are problems with this layer of tears, people can develop a common condition called dry eye. People with dry eye may feel discomfort, as though they have something in their eye, they may have burning sensations, or be sensitive to light. They can also have blurred vision and fluctuating vision which can affect driving and reading. 
Dry eye may develop because of underlying health problems, eye treatment or for no apparent reason. One potential underlying cause of dry eye may be inflammation. CsA drops (marketed as Restasis or Cequa) aim to improve tear production by treating this inflammation. 
What are the main results of the review? Cochrane researchers found 30 relevant studies. These studies took place in many different countries (Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Twelve studies were funded by the manufacturer, one was funded by a government agency, and the remaining studies did not report funding.
