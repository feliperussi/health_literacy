Which drug combinations are best for prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in adults with cancer? 
The burden of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and what helps to prevent it? 
In about 70% to 80% of adults with cancer, chemotherapy induces nausea and vomiting (CINV). Depending on the type of chemotherapy, treatment can cause strong or moderate sickness (hereafter referred to as HEC (highly emetogenic chemotherapy) and MEC (moderately emetogenic chemotherapy)). Multiple drug combinations have showed high benefit for CINV among adults receiving HEC or MEC. 
What was the aim of our review? 
Using a network meta‐analysis, we aimed to compare the benefits and harms of different drug combinations for prevention of CINV among people receiving HEC or MEC, and to identify treatment ranking. A network meta‐analysis is a technique used to compare different treatments described in already published trials, even when the original individual trial does not describe such comparisons. 
What studies did we look at? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until February 2021. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations for prevention of CINV among adults with any type of cancer receiving HEC or MEC that is commonly used in clinical practice. In particular, we looked at drugs inhibiting two specific biochemical receptors (neurokinin receptor and serotonin receptor) that trigger nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. We looked at the preventative effects of these treatments over five days. This is the period during which the maximum intensity of CINV and further peaks of intensity are expected, after the start of chemotherapy.
