Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for older people in the community at risk of poor health outcomes 
With increased life expectancy worldwide, there is an urgent need to explore different ways to deliver appropriate healthcare to older people who require it in the most appropriate setting. More older people are now living with frailty, a clinical syndrome characterised by vulnerability to adverse health outcomes including early death, nursing home admission or loss of independence. 
We wanted to find out if organised and co‐ordinated care delivered by healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses or therapists with expertise in caring for frail, older people (known as Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, or CGA) increased the chances that they would be alive and still living in the community (rather than in a nursing home) when compared to the usual care community‐dwelling, frail, older people receive. We also wanted to find out if CGA reduced the likelihood of admission to hospital or visiting the emergency department and the effect CGA might have on an older person's level of functioning and quality of life. 
CGA took place in the older person's own home or another setting in the community, and was delivered by a healthcare team with expertise in medical care of older people. We looked for studies comparing care based on CGA to the usual medical care older people receive in the community. 
Review authors found 21 relevant studies giving information on 7893 frail, older people across 10 countries and four continents. The review shows that older people who underwent CGA rather than usual medical care did not have a significantly lower risk of death overall. 
While the chances of being admitted to a nursing home did not appear to change, there is low‐quality evidence showing there may be a lower risk of being admitted to hospital in people who received CGA.
