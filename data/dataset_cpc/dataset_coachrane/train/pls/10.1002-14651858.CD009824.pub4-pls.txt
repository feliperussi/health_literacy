Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) for preventing and treating acute bleeds during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) in preventing and treating acute bleeding in pregnant women with bleeding disorders. This is an update of previously published versions of this Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Congenital bleeding disorders cause problems with bleeding during pregnancy, labour and delivery. Bleeding complications in women with congenital bleeding disorders are an important cause of disease and death linked to childbirth. Agents to stop the flow of blood are used for women with these bleeding disorders during pregnancy. DDAVP is a drug used to effectively increase the concentration of factor VIII in the blood and to increase the clumping together of platelets to stop bleeding. It does not come from human plasma and it carries no risk of infection. It might be a precious resource in people with von Willebrand disease, haemophilia A or congenital platelet disorders to prevent and treat bleeding episodes related to pregnancy.

Study characteristics 
We did not find any randomised controlled trials assessing desmopressin acetate in this group of women. 
Key results 
There were no trials included in the review. Given the ethical considerations, future randomised controlled trials are unlikely. Evidence is needed to show the risks and benefits of DDAVP when used to prevent and treat bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. While there is evidence from observational trials that shows the drug is effective in stopping and preventing bleeding, we conclude that there is still a need to generate other high‚Äêquality controlled evidence. Given that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, this review will no longer be regularly updated.
