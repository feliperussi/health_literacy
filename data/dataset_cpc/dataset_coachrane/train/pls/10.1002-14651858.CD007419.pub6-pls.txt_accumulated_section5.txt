Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) drugs for diabetic macular oedema
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which is the best type of anti‐VEGF drug for diabetic macular oedema (DMO). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 24 studies. 
Key messages Anti‐VEGF drugs given by injection into the eye improve vision in people with diabetic macular oedema as compared to no average improvement with laser photocoagulation. One of these drugs, aflibercept, probably works slightly better after one year. There did not appear to be important harms from any of these drugs. 
What was studied in the review? The light‐sensitive tissue at the back of the eye is known as the retina. The central area of the retina is called the macula. People with diabetes can develop problems in the retina, known as retinopathy. Some people with diabetic retinopathy can also develop oedema (swelling or thickening) at the macula. DMO is a common complication of diabetic retinopathy and can lead to visual loss. 
One type of treatment for DMO is anti‐VEGF. This drug is given by means of an injection into the eye. It can reduce the swelling at the back of the eye and prevent visual loss. There are three main types of anti‐VEGF drugs in use: aflibercept (EyeleaTM), bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (LucentisTM). Only aflibercept and ranibizumab have received marketing authorisation for the treatment of DMO. All three drugs are used to prevent visual loss and improve vision. They do this by slowing down the growth of new blood vessels and thereby reducing the swelling at the back of the eye. They may have adverse effects, particularly related to effects on blood vessels in the rest of the body. These effects may include stroke and heart attack.
