Regular treatment with formoterol and inhaled steroids for chronic asthma: serious adverse events 
Review question 
Is it safe to add regular formoterol to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for adults or children with asthma? 
Background 
Asthma is a disease of the lungs. Symptoms include wheezing, breathlessness, and chest tightness. Two main features of asthma are underlying inflammation and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the muscles around small tubes in the lungs). The inflammation can be treated with daily steroid inhalers. The bronchoconstriction can be treated with a beta2‐agonist to relax the muscles. This opens up the airways and makes it easier to breathe. Beta2‐agonists can be used two ways: to provide relief from symptoms of chest tightness ('short‐acting beta2‐agonists') and to help prevent symptoms from occurring ('long‐acting beta2‐agonists', or LABAs). 
When asthma is not controlled by daily low‐dose ICS, many asthma guidelines recommend additional daily LABA, such as formoterol. We are confident that LABA improves lung function, symptoms, quality of life, and exacerbations. However, there is long‐standing controversy about how safe these drugs are for people with asthma. This is what we wanted to explore in this review by focusing on rare and serious harms. These are defined as events that are life‐threatening, require admission to hospital or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, or result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a birth defect. 
Key results 
We analysed data from 29 studies in 35,751 adults and 10 studies in 4035 children aged up to 17 years. The participants in the studies had a range of asthma severity, with most having been previously treated with regular ICS (over a wide range of doses). There were too few children in the studies to allow us to be certain about the effects in children.
