Bisphosphonates and denosumab for breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications). 
Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called ‘denosumab’. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy. 
Study questions 
The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status. 
We asked three main questions:
1. For women with early breast cancer (EBC), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)? 
2. For women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC), can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life? 
3. For women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM), can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival? 
Study Results 
We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016. 
Study results for women with early breast cancer (EBC) 
For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women’s health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.
