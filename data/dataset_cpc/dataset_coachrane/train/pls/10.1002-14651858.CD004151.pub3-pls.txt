Interventions for replacing missing teeth: dental implants into the cheekbone for people with no teeth and insufficient bone in the upper jaw to anchor implants 
Review question 
This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was produced to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of long tooth implants passing through the sinus and into cheekbone as an alternative to procedures designed to build up missing bone in the jaw such as bone grafting. The review question was intended to look at three options for this treatment. 
(1) As a complete alternative to any procedures designed to build up missing bone in the jaw. (2) As a partial alternative, for example some building up of the bone would still be needed in the front parts of the jaw. (3) How long tooth implants can help retain any artificial palate (prosthesis or obturator) that may be needed after surgery to remove the roof and/or hard palate of the mouth (maxillectomy). 
Background 
Sometimes there is not enough bone in the upper jaw in which to secure dental implants. Sometimes bone is taken from somewhere else in the person's body, or bone substitutes are used. An alternative approach is to place one to three long screw‚Äêshaped implants into the sinus and the cheekbone (zygomatic implants). This may mean that bone grafting is unnecessary. The implants can then be used to build and secure artificial teeth. 
Study characteristics 
A search was done on 17 June 2013 and the review team found no trials comparing the outcomes of zygomatic implants with conventional bone grafting. 
Key results 
There are no comparative trials evaluating the effectiveness of long implants passing through the sinus and into the cheekbone as an alternative to bone augmentation procedures. 
Quality of the evidence 
Not applicable.
