Can antibody induction therapy help to reduce organ rejection for lung transplant recipients? 
People who receive transplanted lungs are at significant risk of organ rejection. To help reduce the risk of organ rejection, antibodies against T‐cells (a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in immunity) are given to patients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Several types of antibodies have been used, but their benefits and harms are unclear. 
We evaluated the use of antibodies against T‐cells following lung transplantation to find out whether this therapy was safe, beneficial or harmful, and which type of antibodies work best with fewest adverse effects. 
We analysed six studies that investigated the use of several different types of antibody therapies in 278 adult patients following lung transplantation. Flaws in study designs were found that indicated the studies were at risk of overestimating benefits and underestimating harms. 
Our analysis compared several types of antibodies, but with one exception ‐ that antithymocyte globulin seemed to increase some adverse events ‐ we found no significant differences in lung survival or rejection for any of the treatments. There was some uncertainty about this effect because the study was too small to be sure that observed benefits would apply to a larger population. We found no significant differences among therapies in terms of infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post‐transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer. 
Few investigated the use of T‐cell antibodies after lung transplantation, and these included small numbers of participants. These limitations meant that our findings did not necessarily indicate no differences existed among comparisons in our analysis. To overcome this problem, larger and more robust randomised studies that assess the benefits and harms of antibodies against T‐cells for people following lung transplantation are needed.
