Saline irrigation for the management of skin extravasation injury in neonates
Review question: How does saline irrigation or saline irrigation with prior hyaluronidase compare with no intervention or normal wound care for improving tissue healing in neonates with extravasation injury? 
Background: Preterm and sick term infants requiring intravenous fluids and medications are vulnerable to tissue injury secondary to extravasation, that is, leakage of fluid into surrounding tissue. Such injury can result in scarring with consequent cosmetic issues and, in some infants, functional limitations. Remedial surgical intervention may be required for some babies. Saline flush, with or without prior infiltration of hyaluronidase (a protein that promotes the breakdown of barriers that hold tissue planes together), is widely used for the management of severe extravasation injury in neonates, and is intended to prevent or reduce complications following extravasation. Conservative treatment with normal wound care and various topical dressings is commonly used at different stages of extravasation injury with variable results. 
Study characteristics: We found no high‐quality randomised or quasi‐randomised studies that currently answer this question. 
Key results: To date, no randomised controlled trials have examined the effects of saline irrigation with or without prior hyaluronidase infiltration on the management of extravasation injury in neonates. Frequent reports in the literature indicate that saline irrigation is used for the management of extravasation injury in neonates. Research should be directed first toward evaluating the efficacy and safety of this intervention through randomised controlled trials. It will also be important to determine effect size by examining the timing of the intervention, the nature of the infusate, and severity of injury at the time of intervention. 
Quality of evidence: We obtained very low‐quality evidence from case series or reports.
