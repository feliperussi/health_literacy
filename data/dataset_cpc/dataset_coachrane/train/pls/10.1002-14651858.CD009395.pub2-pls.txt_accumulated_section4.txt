Magnesium sulphate for women at term for neuroprotection of the term fetus
Babies born to mothers who experience complications during pregnancy such as preterm birth (early birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and intrauterine infection (infections in the uterus) have a higher risk of a movement disorder called cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a broad term used to describe a non‐progressive physical disorder of movement or posture that is acquired in early life, and that results from complications in brain development. It may also be associated with intellectual disabilities, behavioural disorders, sensory defects (blindness and deafness) and seizures. 
Another Cochrane review found that magnesium sulphate given to mothers before preterm birth could protect the baby's brain and improve long‐term outcomes into childhood. This review aimed to assess whether magnesium sulphate given to mothers before term birth (birth at 37 weeks of pregnancy or later) could also protect the baby's brain and improve long‐term outcomes. 
This review included one randomised controlled study involving 135 women with mild pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and/or protein in the urine). There was not enough evidence from this study to determine the effects of magnesium sulphate on babies born at term. Women receiving magnesium sulphate were more likely to feel warm and flushed in this study than women who received a placebo, but they were not more likely to stop treatment due to side effects. The rates of haemorrhage after birth and rates of caesarean birth were similar for women who received magnesium sulphate and those who received a placebo.
