Writing about emotional topics for asthma control and well‐being
Background 
Stress may cause worsening of asthma. Previous studies showed that "written emotional disclosure," an activity that encourages people to write about stressful experiences, helps to reduce stress and improve well‐being. Therefore written emotional disclosure may have a role in the management of asthma by reducing stress. 
Review question 
We reviewed the medical literature to find out whether written emotional disclosure improves lung function and asthma symptoms in asthmatic patients. We looked at studies that compared the effectiveness of completing written emotional disclosure versus writing about topics unrelated to emotion. 
Study characteristics 
Four studies, involving 414 participants, were included in this review. The trials lasted between two months and 12 months. One study was conducted in the UK, the other three in the USA. All studies compared emotional disclosure writing versus non‐stressful writing. Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents. The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years. In all trials, most of the participants were female. 
Key results 
There is no evidence to support that written emotional disclosure is helpful in improving lung function or symptoms in patients with asthma. However, disclosure may be beneficial for patients' perceptions of their own asthma control. Based on evidence obtained from the studies, we are not able to draw conclusions about the role of written emotional disclosure in quality of life, psychological well‐being, asthma medication use or use of healthcare facilities for asthma‐related problems. Better designed studies are necessary to determine the effects of written emotional disclosure for patients with asthma.
