Guidewire or contrast: which works better for the prevention of post‐endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis? 
Key messages: 
• Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combines endoscopy and x‐ray to diagnose and treat problems of the bile and pancreatic ducts. Compared to the traditional technique involving injection of contrast dye into the ducts with a catheter, using a guidewire technique to gain access to the bile duct probably reduces the risk of post‐ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) and may also increase the success rate of gaining access to the bile duct.  
• Future research in this area should focus on the effects of the guidewire technique in addition to other options for reducing the risk of PEP (for example, rectally administered anti‐inflammatory drugs, a plastic tube inserted into the pancreatic duct).   
What is post‐ERCP pancreatitis (PEP)?  
ERCP combines endoscopy (examination inside the body using a medical instrument called an endoscope) and x‐ray to diagnose and treat problems of the bile and pancreatic ducts (structures that support the process of digestion). With the patient under sedation, an endoscope is passed down the oesophagus (windpipe) and into the small bowel, where the opening of the bile and pancreatic ducts (papilla) is located. A catheter is inserted through the endoscope and papilla into the bile duct. Contrast dye is injected into the bile duct, and x‐rays are taken to look for gallstones or blockage. However, the major risk of ERCP is the development of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) due to irritation of the pancreatic duct by the contrast material or catheter, which can occur in 5% to 10% of all procedures. This may be self‐limited and mild, but can also be severe and require hospitalisation. Rarely, it may be life‐threatening. There are also small risks of bleeding or making a hole in the bowel wall. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are two techniques for gaining access to the bile duct during ERCP. The traditional technique (contrast) involves inserting a catheter into the papilla and injecting contrast dye to confirm access to the bile duct. However, contrast dye may be unintentionally injected into the pancreatic duct. A second technique (guidewire) involves using a guidewire to probe the papilla to gain access to the bile duct. Once an x‐ray confirms the guidewire is in the bile duct, contrast dye is injected into the bile duct.  
We wanted to find out:
• which technique for gaining access to the bile duct during ERCP works best to reduce the risk of PEP; 
• which technique achieves better success in gaining access to the bile duct; and   
• which technique causes fewer unwanted effects (for example, the need to use advanced techniques involving blind incision into the papilla to gain access to the bile duct, inadvertent entry of the pancreatic duct, bleeding, hole in the bowel wall, and death).
