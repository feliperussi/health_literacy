Treatment for mitochondrial disorders
Mitochondria are found within every human cell and are responsible for the majority of each cell's energy production. When the mitochondria do not function properly, they cause diseases affecting many of the body's organs. Usually, these are the organs with the highest energy needs, such as muscle, brain, the eyes, and heart, although these diseases are highly variable. As a group these conditions are referred to as mitochondrial disorders, and they can cause significant disability or early death. We conducted this review of treatment for mitochondrial disorders to determine whether any available treatments are effective. We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that were of high enough quality to be included in the review. Of these, eight were new studies that had been published since the previous version of this review. Two studies which were included in the previous version of this review were excluded because of a high risk that the study results may be biased. 
The included studies are not easily comparable because of differences in the treatment being studied, the dosage of these treatments, the length of study (and other differences in the study methods), and differences in the types of participants included for the research. The studies were generally well designed in order to reduce the possibility of bias, although for most studies the methods describing how participants were randomised were not described in detail. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious side effects of treatment were uncommon, except for nerve damage in a long‚Äêterm trial of dichloroacetate in adults.
