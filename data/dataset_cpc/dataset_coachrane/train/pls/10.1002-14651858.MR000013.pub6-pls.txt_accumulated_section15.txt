What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more.
