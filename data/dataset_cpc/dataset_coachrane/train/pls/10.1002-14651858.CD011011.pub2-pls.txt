Wound‐care teams for preventing and treating pressure ulcers (bed sores)
Background 
Pressure ulcers (bed sores) are wounds that occur on the skin or underlying tissues. These wounds commonly occur in people who cannot move themselves. The wounds are difficult to heal. Therefore, it is important to try to prevent them from occurring in the first place. However, when they occur, it is also important to manage the wounds properly. A wound‐care team is expected to deliver better outcomes for people with these wounds. This is when care is compared to the person being managed by only one health professional alone. 
Review question 
We wanted to discover the impact that a wound‐care team has on the prevention or healing of pressure ulcers. We were interested in studies that included a team that focused on pressure ulcer prevention. We were also interested in studies that focused on treatment of pressure ulcers. The study could include people of any age. The setting where the care was provided could include any type of hospital or nursing home or the person's own home. The study could include people with pressure ulcers or at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What we found 
We searched for studies on 7 April 2015 and found no studies. Because we found no studies to include in this review, we cannot say whether wound‐care teams improve the prevention or management of pressure ulcers. Therefore, the impact of wound‐care teams on the prevention and management of pressure ulcers needs to be studied. 
The evidence of this review is up‐to‐date as of 7 April 2015.
