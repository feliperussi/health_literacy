Printed educational materials for healthcare professional practice and patient health
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether printed educational material distributed to healthcare professionals can improve their practice and in turn improve patient health. 
Key messages 
The results of this review indicate that printed educational materials probably improve the practice of healthcare professionals and probably make little or no difference to patient health. The results also suggest that computerised versions may make little or no difference to healthcare professionals' practice compared to printed versions of the same printed educational material. Further research with rigorous methodology is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these estimates of effect, and may change the estimate. 
What was studied in the review? 
Medical journals and clinical practice guidelines are common channels to distribute scientific information to healthcare professionals, as they allow a wide distribution at relatively low cost. Delivery of printed educational materials is meant to improve healthcare professionals' awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and skills, and ultimately improve their practice and patients' health outcomes. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 84 studies. Most of these studies compared healthcare professionals who had received printed educational material to healthcare professionals who had not received them. Results of this review suggest that printed educational material probably improves healthcare professionals' practice, and probably makes little or no difference to patient health compared to no intervention. Two studies (a randomised trial and a CBA) compared printed and computerised versions of the same educational material and suggest that computerised versions may make little or no difference to healthcare professionals' practice compared to printed versions.
