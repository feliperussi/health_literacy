Digital technologies to help people with asthma take their medication as prescribed
Background to the question 
Asthma is one of the most common long‐term conditions worldwide. There are effective medicines available to treat symptoms, such as inhalers containing steroids. However, for best effect, maintenance medication need to be taken as prescribed. Many people do not take their medication, due to busy schedules and the belief that medication is only needed short‐term. This is known as 'non‐adherence', which can lead to more symptoms and attacks. Non‐adherence is a major health problem; achieving adherence is very important to prevent attacks and reduce the risk of death. In healthcare there is increasing use of digital interventions such as mobile phones, text messages, and 'smart' inhalers that can feed back information about medication‐taking. However, there is limited evidence on whether these technologies work to improve asthma medication‐taking or improve symptoms. 
This review aimed to find out whether digital technologies really work to improve asthma medication‐taking, and whether this improved adherence leads to improvements in asthma symptoms and other benefits. 
Study characteristics 
We found 40 studies including more than 15,000 adults and children with asthma. Studies ranged from about 2 weeks to 24 months' duration, so we cannot say whether these methods are effective in the long term (a long period of years). We searched multiple information sources to identify relevant studies. This review is current as of June 2020. Looking at the data, we aimed to find out whether digital technologies helped people with asthma to take their medication as prescribed, and whether people who used the technology had better asthma control, and fewer asthma attacks, than those who did not use the technology.
