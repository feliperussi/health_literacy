Transplantation of blood‐forming stem cells for children with sickle cell disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the cure rate and risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for people with sickle cell disease. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder mainly characterized by the presence of deformed, sickle‐shaped red blood cells in the blood stream. These cells deprive tissues of blood and oxygen resulting in periodic and recurrent painful attacks. Complications include acute chest syndrome and stroke. Although sickle cell disease is responsive to preventive and supportive measures such as the use of prophylactic antibodies and periodic blood transfusion, these do not provide a cure. The use of hematopoietic (blood forming) stem cell transplantation involves replacing the deformed red blood cells and its stem cells with stem cells from a healthy donor thereby producing normal red blood cells. These stem cells can be derived from either the bone marrow or blood (umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood) of a healthy individual. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 December 2019.
Study characteristics 
There are no trials included in the review. There is one ongoing trial which may, in the future, be eligible for inclusion. 
Key results 
There are currently no randomized controlled trials assessing the benefits and risks; the most appropriate source of stem cells; or the most eligible participants (those who have experience severe complication or those who have not) of the procedure in people with sickle cell disease.
