Tissue graft surgery to treat a wing‐shaped growth (pterygium) in the eye
Review question  We reviewed the evidence to see which surgery used to treat pterygium (a growth in the eye) is better and safer? We wanted to known which surgery was better at preventing the pterygium from growing back. 
Background  A pterygium is a wing‐shaped growth in the outer layer of an eye from the corner of the eye and crosses the border between the white of the eye and the iris (the colored part of the eye). Its cause is believed to be exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun. The growth is more common in men and older people. If the pterygium is large enough, seeing can be difficult. It also can make the patient feel that their eye is irritated, dry, or has something in it. It also can cause cosmetic concerns. In some people, the pterygium grows to cover the entire front of the eye and makes it hard to see. 
Surgery is required to treat this growth. Even after surgery, it can grow back. When the doctor removes only the growth and leaves the spot underneath exposed, the growth returns in about 80% of patients. A new surgery technique removes the growth and then covers the spot with tissue. This surgery is called a tissue graft. When a tissue graft is used to cover the bare spot, the pterygium does not regrow in as many eyes as when the spot is left bare. 
There are two types of tissue graft surgery: conjunctival autograft surgery (CAG) and amniotic membrane transplant (AMT). The purpose of this review was to compare recurrence of pterygium after these two types of tissue graft.
