Post‐operative radiotherapy for ductal carcinoma in situ
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is characterised by the development of cancerous cells in the milk ducts of the breast and is commonly diagnosed by mammography screening. Surgical removal of the breast offers a good prognosis, however many women and clinicians prefer breast conserving surgery (BCS), the removal of the DCIS plus a rim of normal breast tissue, as there is no guarantee that DCIS will progress to invasive cancer. This approach means that most of the normal breast is saved. The main risk of inadequately removing all the DCIS is either a recurrence of DCIS or the development of invasive breast cancer at a later time with the risk that this can progress to metastatic disease (cancer that has spread). Radiotherapy (RT) is treatment using ionising radiation. Giving RT after BCS is thought to reduce the risk of developing recurrent disease (either DCIS or invasive breast cancer). 
This review aimed to assess both the benefit of adding RT to treatment and any potential long or short‐term harm it may cause. Short‐term harm includes skin rash and redness, or inflammation of lung tissue. Potential long‐term side effects from RT include vascular disease (heart and major blood vessel disease), damage to the lungs, development of lung cancer, or osteoradionecrosis (bone damage resulting in bone death). 
The review identified four large randomised controlled trials (3925 women) that compared treatment with breast conserving surgery alone and breast conserving surgery with the addition of RT. The addition of RT reduced the risk of a recurrence of either DCIS or invasive cancer in the treated breast by 51%.
