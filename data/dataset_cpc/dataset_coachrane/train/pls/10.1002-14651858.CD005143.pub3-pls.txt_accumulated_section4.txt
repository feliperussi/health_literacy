Does denser compared to normal bupivacaine, given as a lower back injection, give more effective and safer anaesthesia during caesarean section 
Background: A pain‚Äêrelieving drug, bupivacaine, is used during caesarean section through lower back injection. However, it is not clear that using hyperbaric bupivacaine (denser than the spinal fluid) is more or less effective in pain relief than isobaric bupivacaine (density equal to the spinal fluid). This Cochrane Review summarizes the best available evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the denser form of bupivacaine compared to the isobaric form when spinal anaesthesia (injection of medications into the lower back) is used for delivery of a baby by caesarean section. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to March 2016. We found 10 clinical trials evaluating these two types of bupivacaine, involving 614 women. The studies assessed the following effects of the two types of medicine: women needing to switch to general anaesthesia, additional drugs for pain relief or low blood pressure, experiencing nausea and vomiting, headache and excessive numbness. We found that all the studies had been done properly. None of them reported their source of funding. We await responses from the authors of two more studies, and will cover these when we next update the review. 
Key results: We found that there is insufficient evidence to establish whether denser or normal bupivacaine is the more effective in reducing the need for: a) switching to general anaesthesia; b) additional pain relief medication. Denser bupivacaine had a more rapid onset of pain relief.
