Rehabilitation interventions for people with critical illness myopathy and neuropathy
Review question 
Does physical rehabilitation aid recovery of people with weakness that develops in muscles (critical illness myopathy, CIM) and nerves (critical illness polyneuropathy, CIP) in critical care? 
Background 
CIM and CIP are common complications of critical care. Both CIM and CIP cause limb weakness and weakness of muscles used for breathing. CIM and CIP make people more unwell, increase mortality and slow down recovery. CIP and CIM are major causes of long‐term difficulties with movement. These difficulties can affect 'activities of daily living' ‐ everyday tasks such as bathing, dressing, eating, leisure activities and participation in family life). Recovery takes weeks or months. When CIM/CIP is severe, there may be little or no recovery. 
Physical rehabilitation for people with CIM or CIP may help recovery and improve activities of daily living and may prevent complications. Physical rehabilitation includes stretching exercises and training to build up strength, and practical training in dressing, transfers (e.g. from chair to bed), rising from sitting to standing, walking and balance. 
Study characteristics 
We carried out an extensive search of the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation treatments for CIM or CIP. 
Key results 
We found no high quality trials that met our stringent criteria for inclusion in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Currently there are no RCTs that test whether physical rehabilitation improves activities of daily living for people with CIM/CIP. Well‐conducted research is required to determine the effects of rehabilitation in CIM/CIP.
