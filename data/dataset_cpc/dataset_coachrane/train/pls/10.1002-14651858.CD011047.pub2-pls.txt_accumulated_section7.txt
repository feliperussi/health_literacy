Effects and safety of long‐term use of colchicine on heart disease
Background 
Colchicine is a very old, inexpensive treatment. It has strong effects against inflammation and is widely used in inflammatory diseases like gout. There are many studies on colchicine in inflammatory diseases. Inflammation is also an important component for the development of heart attacks or strokes. Some recent studies have shown that colchicine may have positive effects on heart disease. 
Review question 
We aimed to review all available studies evaluating longer‐term use of colchicine. We wanted to describe the benefits and harms for people with or without established coronary heart disease. We looked at all studies that lasted at least six months, that included adults, and that compared health effects of colchicine use with the use of any other treatment. We took a closer look at people with previous heart issues. 
Key results 
We included 39 trials with 4992 participants in our analyses. Four trials included 1230 participants in total with heart disease. Colchicine treatment had no effect on death from any cause. There is uncertainty around the effect of colchicine on cardiovascular (heart‐related) death. Results showed that cardiovascular death may be reduced, but this was not clear because some of our analyses showed a reduced risk while others did not. The risk for myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) was reduced, but this finding was based on only two studies and a total of 22 events. Colchicine did not clearly increase the risk of total harms but colchicine increased the risk for gastrointestinal intolerance, which was typically described as mild and short‐lived. We found no clear effects on strokes, heart failure, emergency hospitalisations or unplanned invasive cardiac treatments.
