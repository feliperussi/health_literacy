Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators for raised blood pressure within the lungs
Review question 
We reviewed the use of a set of drugs, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, for the improvement of symptoms in participants with pulmonary hypertension (PH). This was in comparison to current treatment or no treatment. 
Background 
PH involves high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs. This causes shortness of breath and reduces the ability to exercise, leading to faints and dizziness. PH can cause the heart to fail, leading to a shortened life. PH is not a single disease, but includes a group of diseases. Key PH types for this review include pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and PH due to left heart disease. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to February 2016. Males and females of all ages diagnosed with PH were included in this review. We selected only randomised clinical trials. All trials used a comparison to no treatment. Trial durations ranged from 12 to 16 weeks. This review involves five trials on 962 participants. All included studies were sponsored by the maker of the drug. 
Key results 
Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators appear to reduce lung pressures and improve exercise capacity in PAH and recurrent or inoperable CTEPH, but not in PH due to left heart disease. It is uncertain if these drugs have an effect on death rates and general health decline, or if they may be associated with serious side effects. There is evidence that suggests these drugs should not be taken at the same time as phosphodiesterase‚ÄêV inhibitors. 
Quality of the evidence 
One outcome was considered to be high quality according to the GRADE scoring system. Two were considered moderate strength and eight outcomes were considered low or very low strength. This means the results reported may not represent the true effect.
