Oxygen therapy in the pre‐hospital setting for sudden worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition characterised by progressively worsening reduction of airflow through the lungs. People with COPD are prone to sudden episodes where their symptoms become worse (e.g. persistent increase in shortness of breath and changes in mucous volume and consistency) and oxygen levels may fall. Initial treatment during these episodes, when patients are being transported to hospital, usually includes oxygen. However, delivering too much oxygen to these patients may cause a rise in the level of carbon dioxide that can eventually lead to a reduced breathing rate and possibly stop their ability to breathe at all. 
Review question 
This review aimed to investigate if oxygen therapy delivered at different concentrations based on patient needs would be less harmful, more harmful, or make no difference when compared to a control group using high‐flow oxygen. 
Study characteristics 
To investigate this question we looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), these are studies in which people involved have an equal chance of receiving the treatment or comparator. We were interested in trials that compared different flow rates (concentrations) of oxygen delivered in an ambulance to people being transferred to hospital because of sudden worsening of COPD symptoms. 
Key results 
Only one study was found that addressed the review question. The study randomised participants to either have titrated oxygen (oxygen therapy delivered at different concentrations tailored to patient needs in order to keep the levels of oxygen in the blood between 88% and 92%) or high‐flow oxygen (oxygen therapy delivered at a consistently high concentration).
