Acupuncture for acute stroke
Review question 
To assess the effects and safety of acupuncture for rehabilitating people after stroke caused by blood clots or bleeding in the brain. 
Background 
Stroke is a devastating disease with high morbidity and mortality. Acupuncture, one of the main physical therapies in Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been widely used to treat stroke for over hundreds of years in China, but evidence of its effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation is inconsistent. 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry up to February 2017, and two clinical trials platforms (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Clinicaltrials.gov) up to April 2017. We included in this review 33 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with 3946 participants. Of these, results were available for up to 22 trials (2865 participants) that compared acupuncture with any control but for only six trials (668 participants) that compared acupuncture with a sham acupuncture procedure. 
Key results 
The effects of acupuncture in reducing death or dependency or improving neurological and movement scores at the end of follow‚Äêup, as seen in trials comparing acupuncture with any control, were not seen in trials comparing acupuncture with the more reliable control of sham acupuncture. Adverse events such as pain, dizziness, and faint were reported in 6.2% (64/1037) of participants, and 1.4% (14) of these had to discontinue acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low or very low owing to risk of bias in the included studies and variation in the type and duration of acupuncture. Additional larger reliable research trials are required for enhanced confidence in the effects of acupuncture for acute stroke.
