Vitrectomy for idiopathic macular hole
Background  A macular hole is an opening in the retina (the layer at the back of the eye that is sensitive to light) that develops at the fovea (the part of the eye that is responsible for sharp vision) and causes a small dark spot in the central vision, often preventing those with the condition from recognising very small objects, and particularly from reading ordinary print. Macular holes can be seen in people with highly myopic eyes (who cannot see clearly in the distance) or following ocular trauma, but in the great majority of cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic). 
Pars plana vitrectomy has been used for more than a decade to treat full‚Äêthickness macular holes, which if left untreated cause a blind spot in central vision that only rarely improve naturally. Vitrectomy is a surgical technique involving the removal of the vitreous body (the clear gel that fills the eye). The surgeon inserts thin tubes called cannulas into the eyes through scleral (white part of the eye) incisions or incision of the eye wall to relieve traction exerted by the vitreous to the central retina and close the hole. The objective of this review was to examine the effects on visual acuity of vitrectomy for idiopathic macular hole. 
Study characteristics  We included three studies, published between 1996 and 2004 and conducted in the USA and the UK, including 270 eyes in analyses, comparing vitrectomy and observation after 6 or 12 months. The evidence is current as of March 2015. 
Key results  Vitrectomy improved visual acuity in participants with macular hole by about 1.5 lines of a standard distance acuity chart. Macular hole closure was much more likely with vitrectomy compared to observation, with mean closure rates of 76% versus 11%, respectively. 
Cataract surgery was common in operated eyes. In the largest study, retinal detachment occurred in the months following vitrectomy in about 5% of cases.
