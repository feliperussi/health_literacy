What are the benefits and risks of people with COVID‐19 using antimicrobial mouthwashes or nasal sprays to improve their health and protect healthcare workers who treat them? 
Why is this question important? 
COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Most people infected with COVID‐19 develop a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection). Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care. 
COVID‐19 spreads from person to person primarily through droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. A person can also become infected by touching a surface or object that has viral droplets on it, and then touching their own mouth or nose. 
Administering antimicrobial mouthwash (to rinse the mouth) or nasal spray (sprayed into the nose) to people with COVID‐19 might help them fight the infection and prevent them from infecting the healthcare workers who treat them. Antimicrobial mouthwash and nasal spray are liquids that kill or stop the growth of micro‐organisms such as viruses or bacteria. 
As with any medical treatment, antimicrobial mouthwash and nasal spray have potential risks as well as benefits. It is possible that using mouthwash or nasal spray could cause a variety of unwanted (adverse) effects, including irritation, allergic reactions or loss of smell. It may also remove micro‐organisms from the mouth or nose that are useful for protecting the body against infection. 
What did we aim to do? 
To assess the benefits and risks for patients and healthcare workers of administering antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays to patients with COVID‐19, we set out to review the research evidence. In particular, we wanted to investigate the effects of patient use of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays on: 
‐ patient deaths and healthcare needs – including the need for hospitalisation, artificial breathing support, dialysis or haemofiltration (treatments required when the kidneys do not work properly);
