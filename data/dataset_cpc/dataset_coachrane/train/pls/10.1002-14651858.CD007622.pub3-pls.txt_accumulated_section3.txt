Group versus conventional antenatal care for pregnant women
Antenatal care is one of the most important healthcare services provided for pregnant women around the world. In most Western countries, health care during pregnancy traditionally involves a schedule of one‐to‐one visits with a midwife, an obstetrician or a general practitioner (GP) in a hospital or clinic setting. A different way of providing pregnancy care involves use of a group model rather than a one‐to‐one approach. Group antenatal or pregnancy care has been developed in the USA in a model known as CenteringPregnancy. Care is provided by a midwife or an obstetrician to groups of eight to 12 women of similar gestational age. Groups meet eight to 10 times during pregnancy at the usual scheduled visits, with sessions running for 90 to 120 minutes. All pregnancy care is provided in this group setting by integrating the usual pregnancy health assessment with information, education and peer support. 
We undertook a systematic review of trials that compared the effects of group pregnancy care versus conventional individual pregnancy care on psychosocial, physiological, labour and birth outcomes for women and their babies as well as on care provider satisfaction. Four randomised controlled trials (involving 2350 women) were included: two were undertaken in the USA, one in Sweden and one in Iran. We found no differences between women who received group pregnancy care and those given one‐to‐one care in terms of important pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, infant birthweight or death of the baby. Women who attended group pregnancy care were no more likely to initiate breastfeeding than those receiving standard care. In one trial, women who attended group pregnancy care rated their satisfaction as similar to women receiving individual care.
