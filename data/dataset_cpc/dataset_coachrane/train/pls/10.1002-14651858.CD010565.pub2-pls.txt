Observation alone versus drain tube or needle insertion (interventional) for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults without previous lung disease. 
Review question: A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a collection of air in the lining of the lung that occurs on its own or without a traumatic event. When this occurs, people can have chest pain and shortness of breath. Most of the time, the air in the lung is absorbed by the body and slowly decreases with time. Most of the guidelines in managing this condition recommend draining the air by sucking it out with a small needle, or placing a larger tube into the chest that drains the air over a period of time (both called 'interventional' management'). We aimed to examine the evidence for the recommendation. 
Background: Interventional management can have side effects, such as causing more pain, infection, and potentially damaging nearby structures. The other way of treatment is called observational or conservative, where pain relief and extra oxygen are given until the lung re‐inflates and the air is absorbed by the body on its own. Studies that look back on how patients were managed (retrospective studies) and personal experience of the authors with these patients show that managing them by observation alone can work well. 
Review findings: The authors of this review searched for studies that compared interventional management with observational management but found no completed studies, although there is one study in progress. This means that there is a lack of high‐quality evidence about the best way to manage a primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults aged over 18 without previous lung disease; further studies are needed. The evidence is current to 26th June 2014.
