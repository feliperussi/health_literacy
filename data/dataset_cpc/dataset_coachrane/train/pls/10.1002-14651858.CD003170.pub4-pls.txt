Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment 
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about whether treatment of retinal breaks (holes or tears in the retina) and retinal lattice degeneration (thinning and atrophy of retinal tissue) can prevent retinal detachment, a serious vision‚Äêthreatening problem. 
Background  The retina is composed of membraneous layers at the back of the eye. It is the part of the eye that converts visual images into information interpreted by the brain as vision. Sometimes, retinal tissue can tear (known as retinal breaks). The effects of the tearing may cause visual disturbances such as dark floaters or flashing lights. When retinal breaks develop without symptoms, they are termed asymptomatic. Retinal lattice degeneration is a condition associated with retinal breaks in which the retinal tissue breaks down or thins in a lattice pattern. 
When a retinal break occurs, fluid from the eye may leak between layers of the retina, specifically between the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, and cause separation. This separation is known as retinal detachment. Because retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are associated with retinal detachment, treatment of these conditions has been proposed as a way to prevent retinal detachment. Laser therapy or cryotherapy (freezing), or both, are often used with the goal of eliminating the fluid and space between retinal layers. 
Results  The author of this review discovered no relevant studies. There is no evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic therapy for asymptomatic tears or holes in the retina. The evidence is current to February 2014.
