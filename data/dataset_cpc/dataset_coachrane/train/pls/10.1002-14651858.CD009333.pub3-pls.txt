A comparison of the effectiveness and safety of the two most common therapies for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) 
Background  This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Interferons‐beta versus glatiramer acetate for relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis' (first published in the Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7). 
At present, the therapeutic choice for people with MS requires informed discussion on the equivalence of therapeutic agents. This study is important because it is the first report evaluating through a direct comparison whether two treatments, interferons‐beta (IFNs‐beta) and glatiramer acetate (GA), have the same effect on the disease course.  Study characteristics  We searched medical databases for studies in which neither participants nor researchers were told which treatment was given (randomised double‐blind trials). The efficacy of the two therapies was considered in terms of occurrence of relapse and progression of disease.  Key results and quality of evidence  Up to August 2016, we found six studies comprising 2904 participants (1704 treated with IFNs; 1200 with GA) that met our inclusion criteria requirements. We found that the two therapies seemed to have similar effects or only small differences in the occurrence of relapse or progression.  The quality of evidence was moderate overall, although in terms of the safety profile the quality of evidence was low. The risk for incomplete outcome data was found to be high, as some studies present incomplete reporting of adverse events and numbers of participants who dropped out.  It is worth noting that all studies but one were sponsored by the drug industry. Furthermore, all of the studies were short‐term, with a treatment duration of three years for one study and two years for the other four, while one study was stopped early after one year.
