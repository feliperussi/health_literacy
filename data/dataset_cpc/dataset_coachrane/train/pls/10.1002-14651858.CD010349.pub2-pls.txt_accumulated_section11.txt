Iodine‐131‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk neuroblastoma 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness and side effects of 131I‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine (131I‐MIBG) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL). 
Background 
NBL is a rare solid cancer that develops from special nerves cells. Patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL have a poor outcome, despite intensive treatments such as high‐dose chemotherapy to kill the cancer and surgery. This poor outcome needs research to look for new therapies, such as treatment with 131I‐MIBG, which is a type of targeted radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer without causing too much damage to surrounding area). 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to April 2016.
We found two cohort studies (where a group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) looking at 131I‐MIBG treatment in 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. 
Key results 
The studies were not comparable with regard to the children, the ways they were treated and the ways the different outcomes were defined and so it was impossible to combine the results in an analysis. Not all relevant outcome results were available. 
The percentages of children whose cancer reduced or disappeared after treatment (response rate) were 56% and 73% in the two studies, but survival was still poor: overall survival (length of time that the child remained alive) was about 15 months, event‐free survival (time during which there were no objective signs of tumor recurrence) was about 10 months. Overall survival five years after treatment was 14.6%, and after 10 years was 12.2%.
