Drugs to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults
We set out to determine, from randomized controlled trials, which drugs improve health outcomes in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
Background 
ARDS is a life‐threatening condition caused by injury to the lungs, for example from infections such as pneumonia or sepsis, or from trauma. People with ARDS are cared for in an intensive care unit, and need support with breathing from mechanical ventilation. Many people who survive ARDS suffer from muscle weakness, fatigue, reduced quality of life after hospital discharge, and may not be fit for work 12 months later. Despite improvements in techniques to manage ARDS, death rates are still very high. Drugs may help to repair damage to the lung injury, or limit the body's response to the injury (for example, by reducing any excess fluid that may collect around the injured lungs). 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 10 December 2018. We included 48 studies, of 20 different drug types, involving 6299 people who had ARDS. Three studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and 18 studies are still ongoing. We found differences between included studies, such as the severity of ARDS, or potential differences in clinical management and doses. We excluded studies published before 2000, in order to only include up‐to‐date clinical management of people with ARDS (for example, in the pressure applied during mechanical ventilation). However, we found that many studies did not report these management strategies. 
For the main comparisons in this review, we included five types of drugs: corticosteroids, surfactants, N‐acetylcysteine, statins, and beta‐agonists. These were compared to placebo or to standard care.
