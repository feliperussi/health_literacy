Psychological therapies for the management of migraine in adults
Bottom line 
There was an absence of good‐quality evidence that psychological therapy was effective or harmful in managing frequent migraine immediately following treatment or in the longer term. 
Background 
Migraine is a condition of the nervous system that is common and associated with lower quality of life and disability. Although medications can help manage migraine, they do not work for all individuals and some individuals experience negative side‐effects (adverse events). Numerous psychological therapies have been evaluated for the management of migraine in adults. Psychological therapies deliver skills such as education, relaxation, or coping strategies to help adults change their behaviour or thoughts about migraine, to try to reduce their migraine‐related symptoms. 
Review question 
We evaluated psychological interventions for adults with chronic or episodic migraine with and without aura (a warning sign that precedes and predicts a migraine). We compared individuals who received psychological therapy for migraine with a 'control' group. Control groups included usual treatment ('standard care'), or waiting to receive treatment, or receiving another type of intervention such as education. We extracted data on the frequency of migraines (i.e. number of days with migraines, or number of migraines, in the month following treatment) as our primary outcome. We also extracted data on the number of responders (people with a 50% reduction in migraine frequency), migraine intensity, migraine duration (number of hours of migraine per day), migraine medication usage, mood, quality of life, and migraine‐related disability. We recorded instances of harm (adverse events) associated with treatment.
