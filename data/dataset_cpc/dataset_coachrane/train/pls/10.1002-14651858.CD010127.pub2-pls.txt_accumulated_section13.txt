Nutrition support for people having an operation for bladder cancer
Review objective 
To assess the effects of perioperative nutrition in participants undergoing an operation for treating bladder cancer. 
Background 
Some people with advanced bladder cancer require an operation called a radical cystectomy to remove their bladder, which has a risk of complications after surgery. 
Some people who have bladder cancer may have difficulties with eating before or after the operation and may lose weight and be malnourished. In this review, we wanted to see if providing additional nutrition is of benefit compared to waiting for people to eat ordinary food. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current up to 22 February 2019. There were eight studies conducted including 500 people in hospital. There were seven different ways in which nutrition was given. 
Key results 
1. Feeding into a vein versus oral nutrition: based on one study that included 157 people, we found that feeding into a vein may increase complications after surgery. However, there may be little or no difference in length of hospital stay. 
2. Immuno‐enhancing nutrition versus standard supplements: immuno‐enhancing nutrition has high levels of nutrients that are thought to improve the immune function and was given in one study that included 29 people. We found that this form of nutrition may decrease complications 90 days after surgery, but may have little effect on length of hospital stay. 
3. Preoperative oral nutrition support versus diet: based on one study that included 28 people, we are uncertain if oral supplements before surgery improve complications after surgery. Length of hospital stay was not reported. 
4. Early postoperative feeding versus standard care: based on one study that included 102 people, early postoperative feeding may increase postoperative complications after surgery, but we are very uncertain of this finding. Length of hospital stay may be similar.
