Making improvements to routine health information systems to strengthen the management of health systems 
For health services and systems to function well, managers need a routine information system that produces reliable information about how well these services are working and that supports the use of this information to improve services. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to see if different ways of improving the routine information system could improve the quality and use of this information and the quality and use of health services. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found six studies. 
Key messages 
Moving from paper‐based information systems to electronic and digital systems probably allows staff at healthcare facilities to collect some types of routine health information faster and with fewer mistakes. But there are many evidence gaps, and we still need to know more about the effect of different approaches on information quality and use and on the quality of healthcare services and the broader health system. 
What was studied in the review? 
Staff at healthcare facilities usually routinely collect information about the services they provide. This often includes information about their patients’ health and the type of treatments and tests they receive. Managers at different levels of the health system also collect information, for instance about human resources, finances, medicines and supply systems. Managers can then use this information to make decisions about how to organise and improve the services. This is referred to as a “routine health information system”. It is often a paper‐based system, but information can also be gathered through electronic systems.
