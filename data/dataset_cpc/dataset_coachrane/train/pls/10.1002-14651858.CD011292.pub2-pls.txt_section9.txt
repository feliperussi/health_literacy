This review includes 63 trials involving 5761 participants. Most trials (28) consisted of aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, cycling, dance), whereas seven trials included a resistance training‐only group, and 21 trials included a combined aerobic exercise and resistance training group. One in five participants placed in a PA intervention group dropped out before the end of the study, and on average one‐quarter of target PA sessions were missed by participants. We found no studies that looked at effects of PA after cancer treatment on risk of recurrence or dying from breast cancer or any other cause. We found that participants performing PA had more favourable values by the end of the intervention and experienced greater positive changes over the intervention period in terms of QoL, views on their emotional health and physical ability, social function, feelings of worry, stamina, PA levels, body fat, and strength of muscles, compared with usual care participants. Researchers found no effects on perceived health, ability to sleep, feelings of pain, sexual function, body mass index, waist‐to‐hip girth ratio, and bone health of the upper and lower spine or hip. At least three months after completion of the intervention, actual values and changes from the start of the intervention in feelings of tiredness, stamina, and self‐reported PA levels remained more favourable in participants given PA intervention than in those given usual care. Both aerobic exercise only and combined aerobic and resistance training interventions improved QoL and stamina. Aerobic exercise improved views on perceived emotional health and physical ability, as well as social function and self‐reported PA levels, whereas resistance training resulted in greater improvement in muscle strength. Combined aerobic and resistance training interventions led to reduced feelings of tiredness. Trialists reported few minor adverse events among those given PA interventions.
