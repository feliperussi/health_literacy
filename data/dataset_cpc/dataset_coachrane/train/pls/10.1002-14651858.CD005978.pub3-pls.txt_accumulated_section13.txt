Zinc supplementation for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged two to 59 months
Review question 
We evaluated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation to prevent pneumonia in children aged from two to 59 months. 
Background 
Zinc is an essential element for children's growth and development. Too little zinc is associated with increased risk of infection, particularly diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children are more prone to zinc deficiency because they are less able to absorb dietary zinc and some children, especially in low‐income countries, may not have received enough zinc from their mothers before birth. Zinc supplements for children has been reported to prevent pneumonia. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to October 2016. This is an update of a review published in 2010. We did not find any new studies for this update. 
Study characteristics 
We included six studies that investigated zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Peru and South Africa and involved 5193 children aged from two to 59 months. Children received either zinc or a similar‐looking treatment that did not contain zinc. In two studies, children were also given vitamin A. 
Study funding sources 
All included studies were funded. Of these, three explicitly mentioned that funding agencies had no role in the design and results of the study. 
Key results 
Zinc supplementation was significantly associated with reducing the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia among children aged from two to 59 months. On subgroup analysis, we found that a more stringent diagnosis (radiological examination) increased the reduction in pneumonia incidence.
