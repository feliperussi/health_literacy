Interventions to slow progression of nearsightedness in children
What was the aim of this review?To find out if there are treatments that can slow the progress of nearsightedness (myopia) in children. Myopia is a vision condition in which people can see close objects clearly, but objects farther away appear blurred. 
Key messageEye drop medication, such as atropine, probably slows myopia progression in children. Children taking these eye drops may have blurred near vision, sensitivity to light, and some itching and discomfort. Multifocal lenses, either spectacles or contact lenses, may also confer a small benefit. 
What did we study in this review?During childhood and adolescence, the eyeballs can grow too long and can develop myopia. Treatments can slow growth of the eye, thereby slowing down the progression of myopia. 
Cochrane researchers assessed how certain the evidence was for each review finding, factoring in problems such as the ways studies were done, inclusion of very small studies, and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that can make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What were the main results of this review?Cochrane researchers found 41 studies of treatments to slow myopia progression. These studies included a total of 6772 children. The review found that the following treatments may slow the progression of myopia, compared with wearing ordinary spectacles. 
• Eye drops, in particular antimuscarinic drugs such as atropine, pirenzepine gel, and cyclopentolate (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
• Multifocal spectacles (either bifocal or progressive addition lenses) (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
• Bifocal soft contact lenses (low‐certainty evidence).
• Orthokeratology contact lenses (moderate‐certainty evidence).
• Combinations of eye drops and multifocal spectacles (moderate‐certainty evidence).
The review found that the following treatments may have a small effect, or no effect, on myopia progression. 
• Spherical aberration soft contact lenses (low‐certainty evidence).
• Systematic adenosine antagonists (moderate‐certainty evidence).
Children who wear undercorrected spectacles may have an increased chance of myopia progression compared with children who wear fully corrected spectacles (low‐certainty evidence). Only very low‐certainty evidence on rigid gas permeable contact lenses was available.
