What is the evidence for benefit from leukotriene receptor antagonists in pre‐school children who wheeze when they have a cold? 
Background to the review 
Acute episodes of wheezing in pre‐school aged children are common. Many children in this age group seem to wheeze only when they have a common cold‐type virus with no ongoing symptoms between episodes, unlike older children with allergic‐type asthma. Acute episodes of wheezing cause the child to breathe more quickly than normal and they may require supportive treatment such as the use of rescue inhalers; in moderate or severe episodes they may also need a short course of oral steroids and not uncommonly may require treatment in hospital and supplemental oxygen. Their carers may need to take time off work to look after children who are unwell. Although episodic wheezing with viruses is a common problem, there is controversy about the best way to prevent or shorten episodes. 
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are drugs that are taken by mouth and work by reducing inflammation and allergic reactions in the airways. 
Aim of the review 
In this review, we have combined the evidence from the different studies comparing the maintenance (regular) or intermittent (just during episodes of wheeze with viruses) use of LTRAs with placebo in episodic viral wheezing in pre‐school children. 
What did we find? 
We identified five eligible studies that varied in their choice of outcomes and therefore limited our ability to combine the findings between different studies. We failed to find any evidence of benefit of maintenance or intermittent LTRA treatment over placebo for preventing acute episodes of wheezing requiring use of rescue oral steroids, and little evidence of clinical benefit in other outcomes.
