Obstetric outcomes after conservative treatment for cervical intraepithelial lesions
The issue  Cervical intra‐epithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a pre‐cancerous lesion of the cervix uteri (neck of the womb) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which may develop into cervical cancer, if not treated. Local treatment involves destroying or removing the abnormal area of the cervix, leaving most of the cervix, and the uterus in place maintaining the ability to become pregnant in the future, if desired. Certain types of local treatment may also be suitable for very early cervical cancer (stage IA1) if the tumour is very small and very unlikely to have spread beyond the cervix. There are many studies investigating whether the local treatment for CIN and early cervical cancer increases the risk of preterm birth (PTB) in subsequent pregnancies. However, there is no definite conclusion and this creates confusion for both the medical staff and women who may be recommended treatment, but also want to have children in the future. 
The aim of the review  We aimed to assess whether the local conservative treatment techniques for cervical precancer (CIN) and early cervical cancer increased the risk of complications for mother and baby during pregnancy occurring after treatment, and especially whether treatment is associated with an increase in the risk of PTB. We also studied whether the risk of PTB increases with increasing amount of cervical tissue removed. 
Selection criteria  We included all studies that investigated the effect of treatment of CIN and early cervical cancer on late pregnancy outcomes (beyond 24 weeks of gestation) in women who had been treated previously for CIN and early cervical cancer, as compared to women who had not been treated. We excluded studies that had no untreated comparison group, reported pregnancy outcomes in women who had undergone treatment during pregnancy, or had a high‐risk treated, comparison group or both.
