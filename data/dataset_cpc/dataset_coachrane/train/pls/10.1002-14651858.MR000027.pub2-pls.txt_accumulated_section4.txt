Methods for obtaining unpublished data
This methodology review was conducted to assess the effects of different methods for obtaining unpublished studies (data) and missing data from studies to be included in systematic reviews. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, two were randomised studies and four were observational comparative studies evaluating different methods for obtaining missing data. 
Five studies assessed methods for obtaining missing data (i.e. data available to the original researchers but not reported in the published study). Two studies found that correspondence with study authors by e‐mail resulted in the greatest response rate with the fewest attempts and shortest time to respond. The difference between the effect of a single request for missing information (by e‐mail or surface mail) versus a multistage approach (pre‐notification, request for missing information and active follow‐up) was not significant for response rate and completeness of information retrieved (one study). Requests for clarification of methods (one study) resulted in a greater response than requests for missing data. A well‐known signatory had no significant effect on the likelihood of authors responding to a request for unpublished information (one study). One study assessed the number of attempts made to obtain missing data and found that the number of items requested did not influence the probability of response. In addition, multiple attempts using the same methods did not increase the likelihood of response. 
One study assessed methods to obtain unpublished studies (i.e. data for studies that have never been published). Identifying unpublished studies ahead of time and then asking the drug industry to provide further specific detail proved to be more fruitful than sending of a non‐specific request.
