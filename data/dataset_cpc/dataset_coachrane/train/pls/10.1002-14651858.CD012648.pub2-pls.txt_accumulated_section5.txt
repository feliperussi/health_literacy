Trifocal versus bifocal lenses implantation after cataract surgery
What was the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review was to examine whether implantation of a lens that contains three regions that correct for distance, intermediate, and near vision (trifocal) into the eyes during cataract surgery differs from a lens that contains two regions that correct for distance and near vision (bifocal), with regard to effectiveness and safety among participants with cataract. 
Key messagesThere was low‐certainty evidence that people who receive trifocal lens after their cataract surgery may experience improvement in uncorrected intermediate sharpness of vision (visual acuity) at one year compared to those who had received bifocal lens. However, there is no evidence of a difference between trifocal and bifocal intraocular lenses for uncorrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, and best‐corrected distance visual acuity at one year. Their effect on quality of life and the ability to distinguish between fine increments of light and dark (contrast sensitivity) remains uncertain. 
What was studied in this review?Presbyopia is an age‐related condition of the lens of the eye that causes a gradual loss of the ability to focus on nearby objects. Further age‐related lens changes may lead to loss of clarity of the lens (cataract) causing loss of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Lenses with three or two regions (trifocal or bifocal respectively) are a new technology intended to decrease the dependence on eye glasses use after cataract surgery. 
What are the main results of this review?This review included five studies conducted in Europe with a total of 175 participants.
