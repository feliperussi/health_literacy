Probiotics for prevention of necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birthweight infants 
Review questionDoes giving very preterm or very low birth weight infants probiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis? 
BackgroundVery preterm infants (born more than eight weeks' early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) are at risk of developing a severe bowel disorder, where a portion of the bowel becomes inflamed, infected, and dies, called necrotising enterocolitis. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability and developmental problems. One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis and associated conditions may be to add probiotics (dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeasts) to milk feeds. 
Study characteristicsThe search is up to date as of 18 February 2020. We found 56 trials, with, in total, more than 10,000 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and some had design flaws that might bias their findings. 
Key resultsCombined analyses showed that giving very preterm and very low birth weight infants probiotics may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and probably reduces the risk of death and serious infection. There is no evidence of an effect on disability or developmental outcomes. Few trials provided data for extremely preterm infants (born more than 12 weeks' early) and extremely low birth weight (less than 1.0 kg), and these analyses did not show effects on necrotising enterocolitis, death and serious infection. 
Certainty of evidenceThe evidence for an effect on necrotising enterocolitis is "low‐certainty" because of concerns that the effect could have been biased by small trials with unreliable methods.
