Management of pregnant women with borderline gestational diabetes mellitus
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is usually said to be any degree of glucose intolerance or high blood glucose level (hyperglycaemia) that is first recognised during pregnancy. Yet no immediately obvious cut‐off points can be labelled as abnormal. It is unclear when treatment should be provided to normalise the blood glucose, as the relationship between increased hyperglycaemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be continuous. Pre‐eclampsia in the mother, birthweight greater than 4000 g (macrosomia), birth trauma with large‐for‐gestational age (LGA) babies, and a future risk of obesity and diabetes in the mothers and babies are all associated with hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. Intensive management involving lifestyle interventions and metabolic monitoring for women with GDM has been proven beneficial for women and their babies. 
This review found dietary advice or counselling and blood glucose level monitoring for women with borderline GDM helped reduce the number of macrosomic and LGA babies. A single trial found that the interventions led to more inductions of labour. The interventions did not increase the risk of caesarean sections, operative vaginal births or women's weight gain in pregnancy. These findings were based on four small randomised controlled trials (involving 543 women). The trials were of moderate to high risk of bias and only data from 521 women and their babies is included in our analyses. Until additional evidence from large well designed randomised trials becomes available, current evidence is insufficient to make conclusive recommendations for the management of women with pregnancy high blood glucose concentrations not meeting GDM (or type 2 diabetes) diagnostic criteria.
