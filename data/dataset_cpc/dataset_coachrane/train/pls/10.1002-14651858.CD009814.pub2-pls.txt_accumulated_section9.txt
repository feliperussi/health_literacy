Complications of trocar types for laparoscopic surgery
Review question 
Laparoscopy is a modern operative technique to perform abdominal (belly) surgery through small incisions in the skin. Specific instruments, called trocars, are used to gain access to the abdominal organs through the skin. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether the use of different types of trocar for laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications and less pain in the first month following surgery. 
Background 
In laparoscopic surgery, trocars are needed to seal the skin openings, while permitting entry and removal of the surgical instruments. The introduction of trocars through the skin into the abdominal cavity is usually safe, yet, in a small minority of people, life‚Äêthreatening complications can occur. The two most serious complications are puncture into a large blood vessel (occurs 0.9 times per 1000 operations) and puncture into abdominal organs (e.g. the intestine, stomach or liver) (occurs 1.8 times per 1000 operations). Less serious but more frequent complications include bleeding or infection of the skin at the trocar insertion site. Also, the degree of pain following laparoscopy could depend on the type of trocar used. It is unclear whether specific trocar types are less likely to be associated with complications and postoperative pain. 
Study characteristics 
We identified seven randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared two or more different trocar types in 654 people undergoing laparoscopy. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
From the data available in these studies, there appears to be no advantage from one trocar type over another for serious complications, which include visceral and vascular injury. However, caution is urged when interpreting these results because very few cases were identified for these types of complications.
