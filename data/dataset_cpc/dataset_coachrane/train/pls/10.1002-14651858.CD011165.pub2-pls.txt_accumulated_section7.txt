Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy versus no surgery for obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing in children 
Review question 
This review compared the benefits and harms of surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) with or without removal of the adenoids (adenoidectomy) against non‐surgical management in children with disturbed sleep caused by breathing problems due to blockage of the upper airways (called obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing; oSDB). We included any studies in which children were randomly allocated to surgery or no surgery published up to March 2015. 
Background 
oSDB can occur in both children and adults. It ranges in severity from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), where episodes of complete blockage of the upper airways and restricted breathing can cause oxygen levels in the blood to drop, waking the child from sleep. Enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids is thought to be the most common cause in children. As such, tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy ((adeno)tonsillectomy) is considered a valuable first‐line treatment for most children. 
Study characteristics 
We included three studies, with a total of 562 children. Two were at moderate to high risk and one at low risk of bias. We did not combine the results of the studies because the trials differed substantially; they evaluated three different groups of children: those with mild to moderate OSAS (453 children aged five to nine years; CHAT trial), those who had symptoms and signs suggestive of oSDB (29 children aged two to 14 years; Goldstein) and children with Down syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis and mild to moderate OSAS (80 children aged six to 12 years; Sudarsan). The studies compared: adenotonsillectomy versus no surgery (CHAT trial and Goldstein) or adenotonsillectomy versus a breathing mask (continuous positive airway pressure; CPAP) during sleep (Sudarsan).
