Medical and surgical treatments for usual‐type vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (uVIN)
What is the issue?  
Usual‐type vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (uVIN) is a pre‐malignant condition affecting the vulval skin, which has the potential for progression to vulval cancer. Most patients have distressing symptoms that include itching, burning and soreness of the vulva, and painful intercourse. There may be white, brown, or red colour changes of the skin, breaks in the skin, or skin thickening. Usual‐type VIN is associated with infection with a virus called human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus). Treatments are aimed at relieving distressing symptoms and ensuring that the condition does not become cancerous. The most common treatment option has been surgery to remove the affected skin areas. Surgery, however, does not guarantee a cure, can be disfiguring, and may result in physical and psychological problems. Alternatives include the use of laser technology to destroy the layer of affected skin, which may give better cosmetic results, but usually does not yield a specimen to exclude cancer. It may also be ineffective in treating uVIN that extends into hair follicles. Non‐surgical treatment alternatives include topical creams and gels, and HPV vaccines. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of these treatments. 
What did we do?   We searched the literature from 1946 to September 2015 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies (NRSs) of uVIN treatment. 
What did we find?  
We included six RCTs involving 327 women and five NRSs involving 648 women. Five RCTs evaluated medical treatments (imiquimod, cidofovir, indole‐3 carbinol), and six studies (one RCT and five NRSs) evaluated surgical treatments or photodynamic therapy.
