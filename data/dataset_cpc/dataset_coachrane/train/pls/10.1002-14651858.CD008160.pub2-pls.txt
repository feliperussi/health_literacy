Workplace interventions for workers with neck pain
Studies have shown that musculoskeletal disorders are the most common cause of sick‐leave and disability in many industrial countries. Neck pain is more common in the general population than previously known.This Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of workplace interventions for workers with neck pain who, for the most part, are not sick‐listed. 
Ten trials with 2745 participants were included in this review. Two studies were rated as having low risk of bias. The workplace interventions comprised education about stress management, principles of ergonomics, anatomy, musculoskeletal disorders, and the importance of physical activity. They taught 'pause gymnastics', how to use a relaxed work posture, proper positioning, the importance of rest breaks, and strategies to improve relaxation. Some studies also included how to modify work tasks, work load, working techniques, working positions, and working hours. Several studies suggested how to make adjustments and recommended alternatives to the existing furniture and equipment at the workplace. 
The present review found low quality evidence that those who received workplace interventions did not get more pain relief than those who received no interventions. We found moderate quality evidence (1 trial, 415 workers) that workplace interventions reduced sick leave among the workers at six month‐, but not at three‐ and 12‐month follow‐ups. This could be due to the fact that few participants in the study were sick‐listed. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate for both pain and sickness absence.
