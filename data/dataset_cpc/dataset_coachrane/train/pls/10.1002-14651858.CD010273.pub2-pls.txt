Interventions for treating postpartum constipation
Women may experience constipation during the postpartum period. Consipation is defined as a functional bowel disorder that is characterised by pain and discomfort, straining, hard lumpy stools and a sense of incomplete bowel evacuation. Haemorrhoids, pain at the episiotomy site, effects of pregnancy hormones and iron supplementation can increase the risk of postpartum constipation; as can damage to the anal sphincter or pelvic floor muscles during childbirth. It is a source of concern to the new mother who is recovering from the stress of delivery. The discomfort does not only affect the mother's health, but also impacts on the new baby's well‐being, since it needs most of the mother's attention at this time. 
A high fibre diet and increased fluid intake can prevent constipation in the puerperium period. Pain‐relieving drugs and laxatives are common drugs in relieving constipation. Laxatives are grouped according to their function, as bulk‐forming laxatives (such as bran, psyllium and methycellulose) that increase the weight and water content of the stool to facilitate bowel movement; osmotic laxatives (such as lactulose and polyethylene glycol (PEG)) that add water to the colon to improve bowel movement; and stimulant laxatives (such as bisacodyl, castor oil and senna), which act by irritating the intestinal wall. Stool softeners lubricate stools to improve their passage. 
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the available interventions to treat postpartum constipation. We did not find any randomised controlled trials where women diagnosed with postpartum constipation were treated with different interventions. We are thus unable to make any conclusions. There is a need for large trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions (such as laxatives, surgery, as well as educational and behavioural interventions) during the postpartum period.
