Drug treatment for respiratory syncytial virus lung infections
Review question 
Does the use of immunoglobulins in very young children hospitalised with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lung infection reduce deaths and hospital stay without increased adverse events, compared with placebo (a similar‐appearing fake drug that has no effect)?  
Background 
Respiratory syncytial virus is a common virus that can infect lungs and airways. Millions of children are treated in hospital each year for RSV, which can result in severe illness and death. The majority of these deaths occur in low‐income countries. In high‐income countries, the majority of deaths associated with RSV lung infection occur in infants and young children with other illnesses.  
Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are a type of molecule normally produced by white blood cells when an infection is present. Immunoglobulins may recognise and attach to viruses (such as RSV) and help destroy them. Immunoglobulins can be produced artificially and given to children who are not making their own RSV antibodies. Some studies have shown that immunoglobulins are helpful in preventing RSV infection in children at high risk of becoming infected. They may also be used as a treatment when an RSV infection is already present, but the effectiveness and safety of immunoglobulins for this use is unknown. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to 6 November 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included seven randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that compared the effects of immunoglobulins with placebo in 486 young children hospitalised with RSV lung infections. All trials were conducted at sites in the USA; three trials included some children from South American countries (Chile and Panama); and one trial also included children from New Zealand and Australia. The trials were published between 1987 and 2014.
