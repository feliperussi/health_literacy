Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for vertebral artery stenosis
Currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of endovascular treatment for vertebral artery stenosis in routine clinical practice. The vertebral arteries supply blood to the back of the brain and if narrowing (stenosis) of the artery occurs there is a risk of causing stroke. Because of difficulty accessing the vertebral artery, standard treatment has been conservative in most centres. The narrowing can also be treated by percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. This involves passing a fine tube (catheter) through the skin (percutaneously) in to the arterial system. The catheter has a small balloon at its tip. The catheter is moved through the arterial system until the balloon reaches the point of arterial narrowing in the vertebral artery. The balloon is briefly inflated which stretches the artery (angioplasty) to reduce the degree of narrowing. Sometimes a device known as a stent is then placed inside the artery to prevent it narrowing again after the angioplasty. Angioplasty and stenting are called endovascular treatment. This review found results from one arm of a trial only involving a very small number of patients. The results suggest that endovascular treatment can be carried out with a high degree of technical success at the time of treatment but there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the risk benefit ratio favours endovascular intervention over conservative management. Randomised trials need to be designed to determine whether the endovascular treatment is more successful than conservative treatment at reducing the long term risk of stroke or death.
