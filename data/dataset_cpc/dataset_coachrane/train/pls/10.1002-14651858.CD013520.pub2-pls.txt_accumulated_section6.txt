What are the benefits and risks of topical medications for treating epidemic keratoconjunctivitis?
What is epidemic keratoconjunctivitis?Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is inflammation of conjunctiva, the membrane covering the sclera (white outer coating of the eye) and inside of the eyelids, usually caused by specific strains of a group of common viruses known as adenoviruses. The infection can spread easily within households, healthcare settings, and the community. In some individuals, the inflammation leads to scarring of the cornea ('infiltrates') and conjunctiva, which causes persistent discomfort and poor vision. 
How is it treated?Treatment is usually supportive with cool compresses, artificial tears, and sometimes steroids.  
What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether any existing topical medication can relieve symptoms or signs and prevent complications, and if these medications were well‐tolerated. 
What we didWe reviewed randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of children and adults with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. We summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence according to study sizes and methods. 
What we foundWe found 10 studies that involved 892 people with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (9 to 82 years old); studies lasted from 7 days to 18 months. When compared with artificial tears, antiviral agents appeared to shorten the duration of symptoms or signs. Povidone‐iodine alone led to more disease recovery within the first seven days of treatment. We found no evidence that any treatment prevented corneal scars more often than artificial tears. The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A was no more effective than steroids in treating corneal scars. Cyclosporin A and tacrolimus eye drops often caused eye discomfort but did not increase people's intraocular pressure as compared to steroids.
