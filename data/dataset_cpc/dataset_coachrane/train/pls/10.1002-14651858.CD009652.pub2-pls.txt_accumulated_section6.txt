Psychosocial interventions to reduce sedative use, abuse and dependence
Background  In this Cochrane review we aimed to measure the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for treating people who harmfully use, abuse or are dependent on benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are a type of drug that can be used to treat people who have anxiety, panic disorder, insomnia and a range of other conditions. Long term use of BZDs is not generally recommended and can lead to physical and psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms when patients reduce or stop using them. Previous systematic reviews, examining other drugs like heroin, cocaine or alcohol, have suggested some benefits of psychosocial interventions to reduce these substances. There has been no Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions to reduce BZD use. 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases and did handsearches to identify and report on all studies (up to December 2014) where participants were randomly assigned to active treatment with a psychosocial intervention or to a control group of no intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). We included 25 studies with 1666 participants in total that fulfilled these criteria. Two psychosocial methods, in particular cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (11 studies, 575 participants) and motivational interviewing (MI) (4 studies, 80 participants) were of high enough quality and sufficiently similar to one another to perform meta‐analyses. We did not subject the other included studies (10 studies, 1042 participants) to meta‐analysis. These smaller studies used a range of approaches including: a tailored letter and standardised interview between patients with their prescribing general practitioner (GP) and relaxation techniques. 
Key findings 
We found that CBT studies showed a short term benefit when added to taper but this benefit was not sustained beyond three months. MI studies did not support the use of MI to reduce BZD use.
