Imaging tests for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review question 
How accurate are imaging tests in detecting endometriosis? Can any imaging test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvis, causing chronic abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, imaging tests have been assessed for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate imaging test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery, or it could reduce the need for surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Furthermore, if imaging tests could accurately predict the location of endometriotic lesions, surgeons would have the information they need to plan and improve their surgical approach. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis by using urine, blood and endometrial and combination tests have been evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
Evidence included in this review is current to April 2015. We included 49 studies involving 4807 participants. Thirteen studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 studies ovarian endometrioma, 15 studies deep endometriosis (endometriosis deeply situated in tissues in the pelvis) and 33 studies endometriosis at specific sites within the pelvic cavity. All studies included women of reproductive age who were undergoing diagnostic surgery because they had symptoms of endometriosis.
