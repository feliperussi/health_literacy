Ethanol (alcohol) for preventing preterm birth
Preterm birth is when a baby is born at less than 37 weeks' gestation. These babies are generally more ill and are less likely to survive than babies born at term. Preterm babies are also more likely to have some disability, and the earlier the baby is born the more likely they are to have problems. Even short‐term postponement of preterm birth can improve outcomes for babies, as this gives time for the mother to be given a steroid injection to help develop the baby's lungs prior to birth. Short‐term postponement of preterm birth may also give the chance to transfer the mother, if required, to somewhere where there is more expert care for the baby available. 
Drugs used to try and stop labor are called tocolytics. These drugs are given to women experiencing preterm labor to try and stop or relax uterine contractions. One of the earliest drugs used to try and stop contractions was ethanol (also known as alcohol), although this is not generally used in current practice due to safety concerns for both the mother and her baby. In this review, we looked at the published studies to see if ethanol was effective in postponing labor and improving outcomes for babies, and also whether ethanol was better than other types of tocolytics used to postpone preterm labor and birth. 
We searched for trials evidence on 31 May 2015 and found 12 trials total involving 1586 women, some comparing ethanol with a placebo and others comparing ethanol with other tocolytics (in this instance, all betamimetics). The trials included in this review were considered to be mostly low quality studies.
