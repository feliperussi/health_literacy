Early versus late initiation of epidural analgesia for labour
Epidural analgesia involves the injection of medication just outside the spinal column. It is an effective form of pain relief during labour. The intensity of the pain increases as labour progresses. Epidural analgesia is an invasive procedure with side effects and more rarely complications. Reported side effects include muscle weakness, nausea, shivering, itching and headache. Epidural analgesia with low concentration infusions of bupivacaine has been shown to not increase the incidence of caesarean section but may increase the incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery and the duration of second stage of labour (Sia 2004). This Cochrane systematic review summarised the best available evidence (published before 12 February 2014) regarding the effectiveness and safety of early initiation versus late initiation of epidural analgesia for both spontaneous and augmented labour. Our meta‚Äêanalysis involved nine randomised controlled studies with a total of 15,752 women giving birth to their first baby and found no differences in the risk of caesarean section and instrumental birth with early initiation versus late initiation of epidural analgesia for pain relief during labour. Although the effects of early or late initiation of epidural analgesia on the duration of the second stage of labour are similar, we are unable to rule out early initiation leading to an appreciably shorter duration of labour. There was a lot of variation (heterogeneity) between the results of the studies for the duration of the first stage of labour. For the baby, Apgar scores and cord pH were not different. We conclude that it would appear to be advantageous to initiate epidural analgesia for labour early, when requested by the woman.
