Adjustable versus non‐adjustable sutures for strabismus (squint) surgery
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if adjustable sutures (stitches) are better than non‐adjustable sutures for strabismus (squint) surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found one study. 
Key messages The review shows that there is an evidence gap on this topic. The Cochrane researchers found only one small study to answer this question and the results were uncertain. 
What was studied in the review? Strabismus occurs when the eye deviates (moves) from its normally perfect alignment. This is commonly known as a squint. Strabismus can be corrected by surgery on the muscles surrounding the eye. A variety of surgical techniques are available, including the use of adjustable or non‐adjustable sutures. There is uncertainty as to which of these suture techniques results in a better alignment of the eye and whether there are any disadvantages to the techniques. 
What are the main results of the review? Cochrane researchers found one relevant study from Egypt. Sixty children under the age of 12 years took part in the study which compared adjustable with non‐adjustable sutures and followed participants for six months. 
Clinically, there may be a small increased chance of a successful outcome with adjustable sutures, but the results showed no statistical difference. The Cochrane researchers judged this to be low‐certainty evidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 13 June 2017.
