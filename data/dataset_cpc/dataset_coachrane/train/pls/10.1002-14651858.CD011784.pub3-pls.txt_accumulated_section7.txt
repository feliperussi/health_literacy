Treatment of communications between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus due to dental procedures 
Review question 
What evidence is available for the safe and effective treatment of openings between the mouth and main sinus caused by dental procedures? 
Background 
The floor of the main sinus near the nose is thin and lies directly above the roots of the teeth at the back of the mouth. Sometimes following infection or dental treatment, this structure becomes damaged and openings or channels between the mouth and the sinus are formed. These are known as oro‐antral communications (OAC). If the OAC is left open (then described as an oro‐antral fistula (OAF), it may become permanent, leading to long‐lasting sinus infections. This condition can be treated surgically by using flaps, grafts and other techniques; or non‐surgically using a variety of methods and materials. There is little evidence for the most effective and safe treatments for closing OACs and OAFs and clinicians who treat these conditions have identified an urgent need for this. This is an update of a review first published in May 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We searched various databases until 23 May 2018. Only one study, which was conducted in Iran, is included in our review. The study ran for two years and involved 20 people with OAC aged between 25 and 56 years. Participants were divided into two groups and two surgical treatments were compared for treating oro‐antral communications; one group was treated with pedicled buccal fat pad flap (PBFPF) and the other with buccal flap (BF).
