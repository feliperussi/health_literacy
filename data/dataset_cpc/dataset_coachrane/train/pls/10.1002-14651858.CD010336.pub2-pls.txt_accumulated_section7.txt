Antibiotic lock to prevent catheter infection in infants
Background 
Babies in the neonatal intensive care unit require medicines and fluids through their veins. To do this, a small tube (described as a central venous catheter, CVC) is inserted into the infant's vein through the umbilical cord or through the skin. This tube is placed just outside the heart. This tube is then used to give medicines and fluid without causing any discomfort. However, this tube does lead to an increased risk of infection, which can be life threatening. There are many measures taken to try to prevent this, but infection still occurs. This review looks at one way to prevent this infection by putting an antibiotic solution into the tube and leaving it to stay there for a certain length of time (called antibiotic lock) compared with a solution containing no antibiotic. 
Study characteristics 
We included three studies enrolling 271 infants in this review.
Key findings 
These studies showed that infants who's tubes contained an antibiotic solution were less likely to develop an infection. One side effect of this treatment could be the development of 'super' bugs. Super bugs cause a type of infection that some antibiotics may not be able to fight. Our included studies did not show any evidence that antibiotic lock was more or less likely to produce super bugs compared with no antibiotic lock, but to show this convincingly the studies would need to be much larger. The rates of death from an infection caused by the tubes were not reduced by the antibiotic lock.
