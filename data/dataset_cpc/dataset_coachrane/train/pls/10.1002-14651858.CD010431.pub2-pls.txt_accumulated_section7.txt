Micro‐invasive treatments for managing dental decay on adjacent tooth surfaces in children's and adults' teeth 
Review question 
The aim of this review is to evaluate the effects of micro‐invasive treatments in the management of tooth decay on adjacent (proximal) teeth in children and adults (primary and permanent teeth). 
Background 
Decay on tooth surfaces that are next to each other (proximal surfaces) is common. Usually it has not progressed into late stages of decay and the tooth surface does not yet have a cavity. 
Different methods are used to manage proximal dental decay. A common method is drilling the affected tooth tissue and inserting a plastic or metal filling. However, a lot of sound tissue can be removed in the process and this method is regarded as invasive). Another non‐invasive methods in use include dental practitioners applying fluoride varnish or advising people to floss regularly. These non‐invasive methods do not require removing any tooth tissue. 
More recent approaches (micro‐invasive treatments) involve preparing (conditioning) the tooth surface with an acid and then either placing a sealing (cover) on top of the surface or 'infiltrating' the softer demineralised tissue with resins. These newer methods work by installing a barrier either on the tooth surface or within the demineralised tissue to protect it against acids and avoid the further loss of minerals from within the tooth. This, in theory, should stop the decay. This approach can be performed by a dentist or other dental practitioner and involves the loss of ​a few micrometers of tooth tissue because of the need to condition the tooth surface with acid.
