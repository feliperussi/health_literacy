The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen (tummy) that secretes several digestive enzymes (substances that break down the food we eat) into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. The pancreas also contains the islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones such as insulin (which helps regulate blood sugar). Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation of the pancreas, which can lead to damage of the heart, lungs, and kidneys and cause them to fail. Acute pancreatitis usually manifests as upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. However, there are several potential causes of upper abdominal pain. It is important to determine if someone with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis or another illness in order to start appropriate treatment. Blood tests such as serum amylase and serum lipase, as well as urine tests such as urinary trypsinogen‐2 and urinary amylase, can be used to determine if someone with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. It is usually the case that a patient is considered to have acute pancreatitis only when amylase or lipase levels are three times the upper limit of normal. With regard to urinary trypsinogen‐2, a level of more than 50 ng/mL of trypsinogen‐2 in the urine is considered an indication of acute pancreatitis. With regard to urinary amylase, there is no clear‐cut level beyond which someone with abdominal pain is considered to have acute pancreatitis. At present it is unclear whether these tests are equally effective or if one of the tests is better than the other in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with sudden‐onset abdominal pain. We determined to resolve this question by performing a literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of the above mentioned blood and urine tests. We included studies reported until 20 March 2017.
