Cerivastatin for lowering lipids
Review question 
How different doses of cerivastatin affect fats in our blood.
Background 
Cerivastatin is a very strong cholesterol‐lowering drug. We don't know how its dose size affects the amount of fats in our blood. 
Search date 
We looked at research up to March 2019.
Study characteristics 
We looked for high quality randomised trials (RCTs) and before‐and‐after studies with cerivastatin in different dose sizes . The trials were between three and twelve weeks long. People of any age and gender, either with or without heart disease were in these trials. 
Participants could be of any age and gender, with or without cardiovascular disease.
Key results 
We found fifty trials with 13,018 participants who had their lipid levels measured. 12,877 participants had their LDL cholesterol measured. 
People taking 0.025 to 0.8 mg of cerivastatin per day lowered their LDL cholesterol by 12% to 42%. The higher the dose, the lower the levels of three measures of cholesterol. HDL cholesterol increased by 5%. 
For lowering LDL cholesterol, cerivastatin is 250‐times stronger than fluvastatin, 20‐times stronger than atorvastatin and 5.5 times stronger than rosuvastatin. 
Only 11 of the 19 RCTs reported the number of people who dropped out of the studies because of adverse effects. The level of drop outs due to adverse effects were similar in the people who took cerivastatin and placebo. 
Certainty of the evidence 
There is a high level of trust around the results  for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and very low to moderate for triglycerides. We have a low level of trust in the evidence around drop outs because many (8 out of 19 trials) did not report drop outs due to adverse effects.
