Early elbow movement compared to delayed elbow movement after a broken elbow in adults
The elbow plays an important role in any arm movement such as reaching or lifting. A broken bone, commonly referred to as a fracture, in the elbow can result from a simple fall onto an outstretched arm. A fracture may occur in one or more of parts of the three bones that form the elbow joint. These parts are the upper sections of the two forearm bones (the radius and the ulna) and the lower section of the upper arm bone (the humerus). A well‚Äêdocumented problem after an injury to the elbow is elbow stiffness and loss of normal movement. After initial treatment, which may involve surgery for more serious fractures, treatment may involve immediate gentle movement of the elbow, using a sling for support only, or it may involve a period of time resting still in a sling or plaster cast. It is not known which approach results in better movement and function of the elbow after the fracture has healed. 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared early movement with delayed movement of the elbow after elbow fracture. We included one trial reporting results at times ranging from two to 47 months for 81 people who had had an elbow fracture that involved the head of the radius. The evidence from this trial is of very low quality. The trial found no important differences between early and delayed mobilisation in the numbers of participants with pain or limitations in their range of elbow motion. All participants were reported as being able to use their arms for full activities of daily living and none had changed their occupation or lifestyle. There was no mention of fracture complications. 
We concluded that there was a lack of reliable evidence to answer the question of whether early mobilisation improved function without increasing complications in adults with elbow fractures.
