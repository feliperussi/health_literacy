Lamotrigine as a treatment for prevention of recurrence of bipolar disorder
Review question 
To investigate the clinical effectiveness (benefits and harms) of lamotrigine for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder in comparison with placebo, combination therapy or existing drugs (e.g. lithium, olanzapine). 
Background 
Lamotrigine is approved for the maintenance treatment (treatment for prevention of recurrence) of bipolar disorder. It could be a viable and effective treatment strategy for the maintenance of bipolar disorder, where it demonstrated a lower risk of recurrence than placebo. In addition, it has been reported to be as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to investigate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment (treatment for prevention of recurrence) of bipolar disorder. 
Key findings 
The evidence is current to May 2021. We included 11 studies in this review with a total 2314 participants. 1146 participants were assigned to lamotrigine, and 1168 participants were assigned to control intervention (869 received placebo and 299 received lithium). 
Our review identified the following.
Lamotrigine versus placebo
Benefits: lamotrigine was found to be superior over placebo in the following outcomes.
1) Reduced the rate of recurrence of manic symptoms 
2) Suppressed depressive symptoms
3) Less need for additional therapeutic agents for the recurrence of all symptoms
4) Reduction in the withdrawal rate due to any causes six months or more after the initiating of intervention 
Harms: adverse‐event profile of lamotrigine was similar to that of placebo.
Lamotrigine versus lithium 
Benefits: lamotrigine was as effective as lithium, except for the recurrence of manic symptoms, for which the rate was higher in people who received lamotrigine than people treated with lithium.
