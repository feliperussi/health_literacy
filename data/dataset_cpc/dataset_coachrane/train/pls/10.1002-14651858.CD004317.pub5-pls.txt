Ways to improve use of hormonal birth control
What is the question? 
What is the effectiveness of methods focused on improving proper and continued use of shorter‐term hormonal methods of contraception (such as counseling techniques, or educational, motivational, or reminder messages) compared with usual family planning care (such as routine counseling or no reminder messages). 
Why does it matter? 
Shorter‐term hormonal types of birth control are used by many women worldwide. The most common shorter‐term hormonal methods are birth control pills and injections. These methods often do not work as well as they could. Women may have problems using the birth control as intended, such as missing some pills or returning late for their next injection. Women may also stop using a method due to bleeding changes. We looked at whether counseling or reminders helped women use these types of birth control correctly. 
Incorrect use of shorter‐term hormonal types of birth control may lead to unplanned pregnancy. As many as 20% of the unplanned pregnancies in the United States of America (USA) are related to incorrect oral contraceptive use alone. There are considerable health and financial consequences for women and healthcare systems of unplanned pregnancies. Identifying ways to improve use and continuation of shorter‐term hormonal contraceptive methods is important to reduce unplanned pregnancies. 
What did we find? 
We searched for evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through July 2018. This updated review now includes 10 RCTs involving 6242 women. Six studies focused on counseling and four studies involved reminders of next dose or appointments (+/‐ educational health information). All studies were conducted either in the USA or Mexico. The one study that was added neither changed the results nor improved the certainty of evidence. 
Counseling may: 
· improve continuation of contraception (6 studies; 2624 participants; very low certainty evidence) 
· reduce discontinuation due to menstrual problems (1 study; 350 participants; low certainty evidence) 
· reduce discontinuation due to adverse events (1 study; 350 participants; low certainty evidence) 
· have no effect on pregnancy outcomes (3 studies, 1985 participants; very low certainty evidence) 
Reminders: 
· may improve continuation of contraception (2 studies, 933 participants; very low certainty evidence) 
· may make little or no difference to adherence to pills (1 study, 73 participants; moderate certainty evidence) 
· may make little or no difference to on‐time injections for injectable contraception (2 studies, 350 participants; low certainty evidence). 
What does this mean? 
There is some evidence to suggest that both intensive counseling and reminders (provided with or without educational information) may improve continuation of shorter‐term hormonal contraception compared with usual family planning care.
