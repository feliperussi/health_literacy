The use of recombinant growth hormone to improve growth and health in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition causing disease in the lungs, digestive system and pancreas. People with CF are often underweight and have delayed growth, which may impact their lung function. Nutritional supplements may not be enough and it has been suggested that treatment with rhGH, which improves the rate of growth and bone density, might help. Treatment with rhGH is usually given once a day via a needle under the skin. It is expensive and may affect glucose metabolism that has implications for children at risk of CF‚Äêrelated diabetes. Hence, we need to critically review the risks and benefits of this treatment. This is an update of an earlier review.

Study characteristics 
This review looked at using of rhGH to improve lung function, growth and quality of life for children and young adults with CF. It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment.
