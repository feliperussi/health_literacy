Music therapy for schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders
Review Question 
What are the effects of providing music therapy or adding music therapy to treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders? 
Background 
Characteristics of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with schizophrenia often have two main types of symptoms: the acute symptoms of hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions), and chronic symptoms such as low mood/depression, social withdrawal, and memory problems. Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses music experiences to help people with serious mental disorders improve their emotional and relational competencies and addresses issues that they may not be able to using words alone. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran electronic searches up to January 2015 for trials randomising people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders to receive music therapy or standard care. We found and checked 176 potential studies. 
Evidence found 
Eighteen trials with a total of 1215 participants met the review requirements and provided useful data. 
The evidence currently available is of low to moderate quality. The results of these studies suggest that music therapy improves global state and may also improve mental state, functioning, and quality of life if a sufficient number of music therapy sessions are provided. 
Conclusions 
Music therapy seems to help people with schizophrenia but further research is needed to confirm the positive effects found in this review. This research should especially address the long‐term effects of music therapy, the quality of music therapy provided and measure outcomes relevant to music therapy.
