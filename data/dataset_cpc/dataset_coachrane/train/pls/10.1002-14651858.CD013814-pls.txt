Study characteristics. 
We reviewed 33 trials (37 articles) with 8270 participants. The trials were carried out in Europe, Asia, North and South America. The studies compared acupuncture with sham (placebo), no treatment and usual care. 
Key results 
Compared with sham, acupuncture may not be more effective in reducing pain immediately after treatment. Acupuncture perhaps did not appear to improve back‐specific function immediately after treatment, or may not enhance quality of life in the short term. 
Acupuncture was better than no treatment for pain relief and functional improvement immediately after treatment. 
Compared with usual care, acupuncture did not appear to significantly clinically reduce pain, but seemed more effective in improving function immediately after treatment. Acupuncture did not improve quality of life in the short‐term. 
The incidence of adverse events may be similar between acupuncture and sham, and between acupuncture and usual care. Adverse effects related to acupuncture were considered minor or moderate. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Many trials showed a high risk of bias due to problems with masking the acupuncturists or participants. This may affect the participants reported outcomes and trialists computed effects. Some outcomes were based on small samples, resulting in inconsistency and imprecision of results.
