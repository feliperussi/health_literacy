Screening people over 65 years of age for atrial fibrillation increases the rate of detection 
Background 
Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia that makes the heart beat rapidly and irregularly. This can occur for brief episodes or may be continuous. Symptoms of the disease include heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, light‐headedness and fatigue. The condition is rare in those younger than 40 years of age but is more common as people age. Not everyone with atrial fibrillation experiences symptoms, so some people are unaware that they have it; others may experience mild symptoms that they do not attribute to the disease. Atrial fibrillation hinders efficient flow of blood through the heart, resulting in increased risk of clot formation. If these clots leave the heart, they can block the vessels supplying blood to the brain, causing a stroke. Treatment with anticoagulant medication is designed to prevent the formation of blood clots and can reduce the risk of stroke by over 60%. 
Review question 
For a screening programme for atrial fibrillation to be worthwhile, it needs to increase the rate of detection and to benefit those identified to have the problem through screening. The aim of this review was to examine the first part of this question ‐ to find out whether screening increases the number of new diagnoses of atrial fibrillation compared with normal practice, in which people are diagnosed when they consult a health professional with symptoms or risk factors that would lead to testing. This review also examined the safety and rate of uptake of screening, as well as the costs involved.
