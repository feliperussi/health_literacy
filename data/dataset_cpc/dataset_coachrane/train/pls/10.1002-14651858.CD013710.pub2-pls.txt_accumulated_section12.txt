What are the benefits and risks of negative pressure wound therapy for managing the open abdomen in people who are not trauma patients? 
Key messages 
‐ We do not know if negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT, defined as pressure lower than a given reference pressure, generally causing suction) helps abdominal wounds to heal quicker or reduces potential harmful effects compared with using a Bogota bag (a sterilised fluid bag used for closing abdominal wounds). 
‐ We do not know if a Suprasorb CNP system (a type of NPWT) helps abdominal wounds to heal quicker or reduces potential harmful effects compared with using an ABThera system (another type of NPWT). 
‐ We do not know if NPWT increases the risk of bowel perforation. Future research should explore healing time, potential unwanted or harmful effects, all‐cause mortality, length of hospital stay, health‐related quality of life, reoperation rate, wound infection, and pain outcomes. 
What is an open abdomen? 
Sometimes a person's abdomen needs to be left open while it heals after surgery. However, high death rates are associated with leaving the abdomen open after surgery. Managing the open abdomen is a considerable burden for patients and doctors. 
How is this managed? 
NPWT uses a sealed dressing connected to a vacuum pump to drain fluid from a wound. However, the safety and effectiveness of NPWT as a treatment for open abdomen is still uncertain. 
NPWT has been used in recent years to treat non‐trauma patients after abdominal surgery. Non‐trauma patients are people who need surgery for conditions that are not caused by trauma (e.g. abdominal infection, cancer, ischaemia). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether NPWT is effective in treating the open abdomen after surgery in non‐trauma patients in any care setting. We wanted to compare NPWT with other treatment methods or other types of NPWT, and we were particularly interested in their effects on the following:
