Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for long‐term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). 
Background 
People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using long‐term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection.

Study characteristics 
This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. 
Key results 
The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful.
