Enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis type VI
Review questionHow effective and safe is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase (a manufactured version of the enzyme arylsulphatase B) for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) compared to other treatments, no treatment or treatment with a placebo? 
BackgroundMucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare genetic disorder where there is a lack of the enzyme arylsulphatase B. It is a progressive and life‐limiting condition with a range of symptoms, which may include coarse facial features, reduced joint mobility, short stature and problems with the eyes, lungs and heart. 
Before ERT was available, it was only possible to treat the symptoms of MPS VI and not the underlying condition. Treatment with ERT allows the missing enzyme to be replaced to try to reduce the effects of the disease and prevent it getting worse.  
Search dateThe evidence is current to: 09 June 2021. 
Study characteristicsThe review includes one study with 39 people with MPS VI aged between five and 20 years old. The study compared galsulfase to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted for 24 weeks (with an extension period of an additional 24 weeks where everyone was given ERT and they knew it). 
Key resultsThe evidence for this treatment is limited because we only found and assessed the results of one small study. Given the very low certainty of the evidence, we are unsure whether galsulfase improves motor function (i.e. the ability to walk and climb stairs) in people with MPS VI. We found that treatment with galsulfase may lower levels of the chemicals associated with MPS VI (glycosaminoglycan levels) in urine tests. These results were seen in a short study and may reflect only short‐term effects. There were no differences between treatment with galsulfase and placebo in relation to adverse effects.
