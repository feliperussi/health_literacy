Lamotrigine add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a disorder in which unexpected electrical discharges from the brain cause seizures. Approximately one‐third of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, despite treatment with presently used (older) antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In addition, the older AEDs have a lot of adverse effects. Therefore, the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of drug‐resistant seizures is of considerable importance. As a result, a range of new AEDs has been developed as 'add‐on' treatments. Lamotrigine is one of these drugs. 
Aims of the review 
This review aimed to determine the effects of lamotrigine on seizures, adverse effects, cognition (ability to learn and understand) and quality of life compared to placebo controls, when used as an add‐on treatment for people with focal epilepsy that would not respond to existing AEDs. For this update, we did not identify any new studies to add, and thus, the conclusions remain unchanged. The review included 14 randomised controlled trials with a total number of 1806 participants. 
Results 
Lamotrigine, used in combination with other AEDs in patients who have drug‐resistant focal epilepsy can decrease the frequency of seizures further. However, adding lamotrigine to the usual treatment is more often associated with an increase in adverse effects such as unsteadiness (ataxia), dizziness, double vision (diplopia), and nausea. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We assessed the trials with regards to risk of bias and overall we judged them as low to unclear. We rated the certainty of the evidence as high to moderate.
