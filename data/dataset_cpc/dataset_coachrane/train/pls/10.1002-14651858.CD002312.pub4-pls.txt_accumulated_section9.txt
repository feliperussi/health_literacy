Clot‐busting drugs for infections of the lining of the lung
Background 
Empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusion are conditions involving infected fluid gathering between the lung and the chest wall (the pleural space). They are treated by draining the fluid with a tube inserted through the chest into the fluid (a 'chest tube'), along with antibiotics. If this does not work, then surgery is usually needed to drain the fluid. Fibrinolytic drugs ('clot‐busting drugs') may make the infected pleural fluid thinner, less sticky and easier to drain via a chest tube, meaning that surgery may not be needed. 
Review question 
We wanted to know if fibrinolytics reduced the need for people with infections in the pleural space to have surgery to fix the infection. We also wanted to see if these medicines reduced the chance of people dying due to these infections; whether the fibrinolytic treatment worked overall; and whether these medicines caused serious side effects. We also wanted to know if one fibrinolytic medicine was more effective than another. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to August 2019. We included 10 studies with a total of 993 patients comparing fibrinolytics with a placebo and compared these to look for differences. We also included two studies comparing different fibrinolytics with a total of 149 patients and compared these separately. 
Key findings 
We found some low‐certainty evidence that fibrinolytics moderately reduced the need for surgery. There was no clear evidence that fibrinolytics changed the risk of death. There was some low‐certainty evidence which showed that there may be a risk of more side effects (mostly bleeding) with fibrinolytics but this is uncertain. We found no clear evidence that any single fibrinolytic was better than another.
