Maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers for preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour 
Calcium channel blockers have not been shown to reduce preterm birth or improve the outcomes for babies when given to women after contractions of preterm labour have been stopped. 
Babies born premature (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) may not survive, or may have serious long‐term problems if they do survive. Women who have had their preterm labour stopped with tocolytic treatment (medication to reduce uterine contractions), remain at risk of giving birth preterm. After this initial tocolytic treatment has been given to stop early labour, a maintenance tocolytic treatment may be given to try to prevent further early contractions and early birth. Calcium channel blockers are one of the types of tocolytic therapy that have been used in an attempt to prevent the onset of further preterm contractions. 
We identified six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 794 women and their babies for this review. The trials were of moderate risk of bias overall. The trials did not demonstrate differences between calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy and placebo or no treatment in the prevention of preterm birth or perinatal death (fetal or neonatal deaths). None of the trials included any follow‐up of the infants to assess longer‐term development. Calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy (with a drug called nifedipine) was more likely than placebo or no treatment to prolong pregnancy, however the infants of these mothers were more likely to have a longer hospital stay. Based on the current studies, we found no convincing evidence that calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy prevents preterm birth for women after threatened preterm labour, or that it improves outcomes for babies.
