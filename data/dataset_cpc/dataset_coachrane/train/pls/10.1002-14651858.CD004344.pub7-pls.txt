Treatments for people with sickle cell disease in whom poor blood supply to an area of bone leads to bone death 
Review question We reviewed the effects of treatments for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. 
Background Many people with sickle cell disease experience bone death due to temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to parts of their bones. This can be very painful. The bones usually affected are the thigh bones at the hip joint and the arm bones at the shoulder joint. The aim of treatment is to stop the pain and maintain a mobile joint. Treatments include resting the joint, physiotherapy, the use of pain relief, joint replacements and bone grafts. However, complications from surgery may be more frequent in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Search date The evidence is current to: 17 September 2019. 
Study characteristics We found one eligible trial, published in 2006, which analysed data from 38 people from 32 different treatment centers from the USA. The trial compared a treatment of surgery and physical therapy with physical therapy on its own. This trial did not show that the addition of surgery to a physical therapy regimen could improve the outcome for people with sickle cell disease and avascular necrosis. 
Key results 
After a mean follow‐up of three years, the combination of surgery and physical therapies did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone. Given that the results are imprecise, we are uncertain as to whether surgery and physical therapies in combination has an important effect on hip pain, vaso‐occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome. Trial authors did not report information on mortality and quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence The limited number of participants included in the study led to imprecise results, therefore, the confidence in the results is very low.
