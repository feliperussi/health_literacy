Platelet transfusions are used to prevent bleeding in people with low platelet counts due to treatment‚Äêinduced bone marrow failure 
Review question 
We evaluated the evidence about whether platelet transfusions given to prevent bleeding in people with lower platelet counts (for example 5 x 109/L or below) were as effective and safe as the current standard (10 x 109/L or below), or whether higher platelet count levels (20 x 109/L or below, 30 x 109/L or below, or 50 x 109/L or below) were safer than the current standard (10 x 109/L or below). Our target population was people with blood cancers (for example leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma) who were receiving intensive (myelosuppressive) chemotherapy treatments or stem cell transplantation. 
Background 
People with blood cancers may have low platelet counts due to their underlying cancer. Blood cancers may be treated with chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, and these treatments can cause low platelet counts. Platelet transfusions may be given to prevent bleeding when the platelet count falls below a prespecified threshold platelet count (for example 10 x 109/L), or may be given to treat bleeding (such as a prolonged nosebleed or multiple bruises). Giving platelet transfusions at a lower prespecified threshold platelet count may increase the chance that bleeding will occur, which may be harmful, whereas giving platelet transfusions at a higher prespecified threshold platelet count may mean that people receive unnecessary platelet transfusions. Platelet transfusions can have adverse effects and have cost and resource implications for health services, so unnecessary transfusions should be avoided.
