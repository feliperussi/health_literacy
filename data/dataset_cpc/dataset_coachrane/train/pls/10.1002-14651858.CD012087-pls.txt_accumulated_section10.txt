Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain
Review question 
We assessed the evidence regarding the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among people with chronic low back pain. NSAIDs were compared to placebo, other NSAIDs, other drugs or other kinds of treatment. 
Background 
Chronic low back pain is common and causes pain and disability. NSAIDs are often used to treat people with chronic low back pain and are available both over‐the‐counter and on prescription in different types and chemical entities. 
Study characteristics 
We collected all published randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs until 24 June 2015. We included 13 trials which compared NSAIDs with placebo, other NSAIDs, other drugs or other treatment in people with chronic low back pain. Six trials compared NSAIDs with placebo, and included 1354 participants in total. Follow‐up was between nine days and 16 weeks. 
Key results 
NSAIDs reduced pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain compared to placebo. However, the differences were small: 7 points on a 100‐point scale for pain intensity. Regarding disability, people receiving NSAIDs scored 0.9 points better on a 0 to 24 disability scale. The number of adverse events was not significantly different between the people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo, but larger studies of longer duration would be needed to identify rare or delayed adverse events, important drug interactions and adverse events occurring with prolonged use. 
Different types of NSAIDs did not show significantly different effects. Three of the 13 included studies compared two different types of NSAIDs and none found any differences.
