Heart surgery for aortic valve replacement through a small incision versus the standard full incision at the front of the chest 
What question were we trying to answer? 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of a smaller "keyhole"‚Äêtype cut (instead of the usual full cut down the breastbone) on aortic valve replacement surgery in adults. We wanted to see if both were as safe and effective as each other. 
Why is this important? 
The aortic valve prevents blood from flowing backwards from the body back into the heart. Aortic valve disease is a common condition that is treated best with heart surgery. The usual way of performing this is by splitting the entire breastbone lengthways to gain access to the heart, but this is thought to be painful and disruptive. For nearly 20 years, some surgeons have been doing the operation through a smaller hole, cutting part of the breastbone instead of the whole length. Doing it this way makes the scar smaller, but can also make the operation more challenging because it is more difficult to see and reach the heart. This might make the operation longer and less safe, even though it looks smaller from the outside. 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We checked scientific databases to find published and unpublished studies that compared fully opening the breastbone (called "median sternotomy") for aortic valve replacement against opening just part of the breastbone (called "minimally invasive" or "partial" sternotomy) for the same operation. We searched all records up to July 2016 and found seven studies that answered this question that had 511 participants in them.
