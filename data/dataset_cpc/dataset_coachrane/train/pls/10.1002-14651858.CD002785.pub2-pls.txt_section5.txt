This review included evidence from five studies with a total of 1993 participants (current until August 2019). Three studies enrolled participants with peripheral vascular disease, and two of the studies included participants with coronary artery disease, one of which specifically recruited people who had had a heart attack. All five studies compared chelation therapy with no treatment or placebo. Only two of the studies (both of which included participants with coronary artery disease) reported death from any cause, and these reported no difference in overall deaths between those that received chelation therapy and those who did not. Ony one study (in people with coronary artery disease) reported cardiovascular death, and this study found no difference between in risk between those who had chelation therapy and those who did not. Two studies of people with coronary artery disease reported rates of heart attack and angina, and found no difference in the risk of these between participants who had chelation treatment and those who did not. Similarly, two studies (one in people with coronary artery disease and one in people with peripheral vascular disease) reported the chance of having a stroke, and found no clear difference in the chance of this between people who did or did not received chelation treatment. Two studies in people with peripheral vascular disease used an indirect measure of blood flow known as the ankle‚Äêbrachial pressure index (ABPI), or ankle brachial index. These studies did not show any differences in this measure between people who received chelation therapy for three or six months and those who did not get the treatment. There was also no clear differences in the distance participants could walk.
