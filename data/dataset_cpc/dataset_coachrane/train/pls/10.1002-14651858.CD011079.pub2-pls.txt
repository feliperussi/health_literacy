Strategies used for the withdrawal of humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHFNC) in preterm infants 
Background: Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) is a form of respiratory support used in the treatment of preterm infants. Potential risks of HHFNC include damage to the nose and leaking of air from the lungs. Infants on HHFNC require more nursing care and the use of extra equipment (when compared to not being on any support). However, potential complications of removing HHFNC from babies too early include increased episodes of forgetting to breathe, increased oxygen needs, increased effort of breathing, the need to restart HHFNC, and the need for a breathing tube with mechanical ventilation. Any of these complications can be seen as a "failure" and are potentially distressing to staff and family. The best way to withdraw HHFNC once it has been started is unknown. Options include simply stopping, weaning the flow, increasing the time off HHFNC each day, or combinations of both. 
Study question :What are the benefits and risks of different strategies used for the withdrawal of HHFNC in preterm infants who are stable and may be ready to have HHFNC withdrawn? 
Study characteristics and key findings:Researchers from Cochrane searched for all available literature up to 30 March 2015. We did not identify any eligible studies looking at the best strategy to wean or withdraw HHFNC once started as respiratory support in preterm infants for inclusion in this Cochrane review. 
Conclusions: The best strategy for weaning, or withdrawal, or both, of HHFNC used as a form of respiratory support in preterm infants remains unclear. Studies are required to answer these questions. Clear criteria are needed to establish a definition of stability prior to attempting to withdraw HHFNC, and for failure to withdraw/wean HHFNC.
