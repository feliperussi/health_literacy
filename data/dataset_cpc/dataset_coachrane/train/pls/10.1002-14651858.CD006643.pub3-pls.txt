Treatments of patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) with interferon beta (INF beta) seems not associated with a reduction of  the disability progression 
This is an updated Cochrane review of the previous version published (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD006643. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006643.pub2). 
Treatments of patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( PPMS) with interferon beta ( INF beta) seems not associated with a reduction of  the disability progression 
To date there is no proven or licensed disease‐modifying treatments to slow the progression of PPMS. Studies on the effects of INF beta have mainly focused on Relapsing‐Remitting MS and have demonstrated a modest reduction on the progression of the disease.  The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of INF beta in  patients with PPMS. 
Among the pertinent medical literature only  two studies, comprising  a total of 123 participants,  met the criteria of the methodological quality necessary for their inclusion in this review. Taking into account  the disability progression, the analysis of the data showed that INF beta treatment in  patients with PPMS was  not associated with a reduction of  this parameter during the first two years of therapy. Adverse effects, mainly flu‐like symptoms and injection site reactions, occurred frequently and were the same as  reported by the many studies on   IFN beta treatments in MS patients with different types of the disease. 
It is worth nothing that the patients’ population analysed was too small to allow a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of IFN beta therapy  in PPMS.
