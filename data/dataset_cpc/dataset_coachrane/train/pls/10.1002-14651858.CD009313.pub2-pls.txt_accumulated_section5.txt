Laser surgery for glaucoma that lowers eye pressure by destroying a part of the eye responsible for production of fluid inside the eye 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how laser procedures compare to other approaches for lowering the pressure in the eye for people with glaucoma not previously treated with surgery. Cochrane researchers sought and analyzed all relevant studies to answer these questions but found only one study. 
Key messages We do not know whether this type of laser surgery is safer or more effective than other surgeries for treating glaucoma. We included only one study in this review. This study compared low‐energy versus high‐energy diode lasers, and the results were too similar between treatment groups to draw any conclusions. Additionally, this study did not compare destructive laser surgery to other surgical approaches. More research is needed to understand the usefulness of destructive laser procedures for primary glaucoma treatment. 
What was studied in this review? Glaucoma is a progressive disease of the optic nerve causing loss of vision. It is a common cause of blindness worldwide. When treated early, vision loss may be delayed or prevented. 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main treatable risk factor for glaucoma. The ciliary body epithelium produces fluid that builds up pressure in the eye. It is thought that procedures that destroy the ciliary body epithelium, known as cyclodestructive procedures, may reduce IOP as a treatment for glaucoma. Different methods of cyclodestructive procedures are available; the most common is laser. The purpose of this review was to assess laser treatments that destroy the ciliary body epithelium. The review focused on the effectiveness and safety of the included procedures by assessing IOP control, vision, pain control, and side effects.
