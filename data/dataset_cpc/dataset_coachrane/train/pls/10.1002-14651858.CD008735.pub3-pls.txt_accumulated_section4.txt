Glucocorticosteroids administered after Kasai surgical procedure for infants with blocked or damaged bile duct 
Medications used postoperatively (immediately after surgery) for infants with blocked or damaged bile duct (that is, biliary atresia) 
Review question Do medications, called glucocorticosteroids (steroids), have beneficial or harmful effects in the health of infants with biliary atresia operated by the Kasai surgical procedure (that is, portoenterostomy)? We reviewed if there was any difference in death, need for a liver transplant, postoperative jaundice (yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes), and harmful effects. 
Background Biliary atresia is a rare condition that may occur once in 30,000 births. In biliary atresia, the common bile duct is blocked or damaged; as the bile cannot leave the liver, the liver becomes damaged. An operation called 'Kasai portoenterostomy' is used to replace the damaged bile ducts with a piece of the infant's intestine. This allows the bile to drain directly from the small bile ducts at the edge of the infant's liver, straight into the intestine. Medications called glucocorticosteroids have historically been used in the treatment of biliary atresia after surgery. Two benefits of glucocorticosteroids may be that they are anti‚Äêinflammatory, and they increase bile flow. Several studies have been carried out comparing infants taking glucocorticosteroids postoperatively to those who have been given a placebo (an inactive substance that can be made to resemble an active medication or therapy). These studies try to identify if there is any measurable difference in the clearance of jaundice, survival, and need for transplantation. To organise randomised clinical trials large enough to be able to detect differences is, however, challenging.
