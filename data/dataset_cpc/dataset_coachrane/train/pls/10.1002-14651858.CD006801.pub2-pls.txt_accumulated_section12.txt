Custom‐made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain 
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of custom‐made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain; 
The review shows that in adults who have had painful pes cavus (high arch), for more than one month custom foot orthoses: 
Decreases foot pain after 3 months compared with fake foot orthoses.
The review shows that for people at least 5 years of age and diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), custom foot orthoses: 
Reduce foot pain after 3 months compared with supportive shoes, but do not reduce foot pain after 3 months compared with using prefabricated neoprene shoe inserts. 
The review shows that in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), custom foot orthoses: 
Reduce rearfoot pain after 3 months, compared with doing nothing, but do not reduce foot pain after 3 years, compared with using fake foot orthoses. 
May not reduce pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint (where the big toe meets the foot) after 6 weeks or 3 months any more than wearing supportive shoes or using soft non‐custom foot orthoses. 
The review shows that for people diagnosed with plantar fasciitis (heel pain), custom foot orthoses: 
May not reduce foot pain after 3 or 12 months any more than using fake foot orthoses
May not reduce foot pain after 6 weeks or 3 months any more than using night splints to hold your feet in a stretched position while you sleep.  However, using custom foot orthoses and night splints together may reduce foot pain.
