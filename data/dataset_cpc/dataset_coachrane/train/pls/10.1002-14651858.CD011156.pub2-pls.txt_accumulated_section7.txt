Pay for performance (payment or penalty methods to encourage hospitals to increase quality of care) 
What was the aim of this review 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if 'pay for performance' — that is, providing hospitals with monetary incentives to meet targets or penalizing them for failing to reach those targets — can improve the quality of patient care, resource use and equity. The review was not limited to a certain health problem. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Key messages 
Pay for performance improved patient outcomes (mortality, clinical adverse events) either only very slightly or not at all. It seems that providing hospitals with additional payments to reward performance achieves only small, short‐term, but non‐sustainable, effects. Penalizing hospitals through non‐payment for failure to reach performance targets seems to be slightly more effective than providing additional payments for performance; and payments for quality attainment (e.g. falling below specified mortality threshold) seem to be slightly more effective than payments for quality improvement (e.g. reduction of mortality by specified percent points within one year). It was not possible to determine if pay for performance affects patient outcomes because the certainty of the available evidence was judged to be very low.The impact of pay for performance on equity is unclear. 
What was studied in the review? 
The payment method for reimbursing health care delivered in hospitals can have an impact on patient outcomes, quality of care, equity, utilization, health care provider outcomes (e.g. workload) and adverse effects. The Cochrane researchers assessed the impact of payment methods that are based on hospital performance (e.g. hospital‐acquired infections) and are thereby aiming to stimulate an improvement of hospital performance.
