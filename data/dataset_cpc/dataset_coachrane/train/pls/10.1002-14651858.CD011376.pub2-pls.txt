Interventions for the management of fatigue in adults with a primary brain tumour
Background 
A primary brain tumour (PBT) is a cancer that began in the brain rather than spread from other parts of the body. Fatigue (tiredness) is common in people with a PBT. This may be due to the tumour, its treatment or to the use of other medicines such as antiepileptic drugs (which are used to treat epilepsy seizures). It may also occur with other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, thinking problems and emotional distress. Treatments to help manage fatigue may improve a person's quality of life, their ability to tolerate cancer treatment (which themselves are associated with fatigue), and their ability to carry out social and day‐to‐day activities. 
Study characteristics 
In March 2016, we searched five medical databases. We found one clinical trial that was eligible for inclusion; the trial investigated the medicine modafinil in 37 adults with PBT and high levels of fatigue. People in the study received six weeks of modafinil followed by a one‐week washout period and six further weeks of placebo, or vice versa. The washout period aims to allow time for any effects of the first treatment to wear off before the new one gets started. 
Key findings 
The one included trial found no evidence of a difference between modafinil and placebo in treating fatigue. It is possible that this could be due to the trial not reaching its planned number of participants. Several other studies investigated the management of fatigue too, but in these studies high fatigue was not essential for participation. We do not currently know whether any treatments are effective in the management of people with PBT and high fatigue. 
Quality of the evidence 
With only one included trial, the overall quality of evidence was low. More high‐quality studies are needed that enrol adults with BPT and high fatigue.
