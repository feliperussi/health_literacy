Pre‐emptive treatment with antiviral agents can help to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of viral disease in people who have received kidney, heart, liver, lung or pancreas transplants (solid organ transplants). CMV is a major cause of illness and death during the first six months after transplantation. Characteristics of CMV include fever, very low white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and very low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia) with or without specific organ involvement. 
Two main strategies to prevent CMV disease have been adopted: giving daily low doses of an antiviral agent (prophylaxis) to all organ transplant recipients, or prescribing an antiviral agent when an organ transplant recipient develops laboratory‐confirmed evidence of infection during routine screening (pre‐emptive treatment). 
This review looked at the benefits and harms of pre‐emptive treatment with antiviral agents in preventing CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. We identified six studies (288 participants) that compared pre‐emptive treatment with placebo or usual care. Pre‐emptive treatment significantly reduced the risk of CMV disease. There were also eight studies (784 participants) that compared pre‐emptive treatment with antiviral prophylaxis. There were no significant differences in the risks of CMV disease or death between pre‐emptive therapy and prophylaxis. However, variation in results among studies meant that there is some uncertainty about these results. 
Low white blood cell counts were much less common with pre‐emptive treatment.
More studies comparing pre‐emptive treatment with antiviral prophylaxis are still required to provide greater certainty about the relative effectiveness of pre‐emptive therapy compared with prophylaxis.
