The comparison of ASA or ASA and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing, included the most studies (six), which allowed for robust analysis. For this treatment group, there was improved graft patency in the ASA or ASA/DIP treatment group. There was an improvement in those that received prosthetic grafts, but not in those that received venous grafts. Only a single study evaluated secondary patency, for which there was no difference between treatment groups. For this comparison there was no difference for any of the side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, bleeding and wound/graft infection. Amputations, cardiovascular events and death from any cause were also similar between the treatment groups. The comparison of ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists included two studies, one of which was very large, with over 2000 participants. There were no differences between treatment for primary graft patency at three, six, 12 or 24 months, and there was also no evidence of a difference for limb amputation, cardiovascular events or mortality. One large study evaluated clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone, and for all grafts (including prosthetic and venous grafts) there was no evidence of a difference of primary patency at 24 months. There was evidence of increased total bleeding in the clopidogrel and ASA group, from an increase in mild and moderate bleeding, but there was no difference in severe or fatal bleeding. There was no difference between the treatment groups for limb amputation or death from any cause. For the remaining treatment comparisons there is not currently enough evidence to draw any robust conclusions about the efficacy or safety of the treatment on graft patency after peripheral bypass.
