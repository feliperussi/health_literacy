Low molecular weight heparin for preventing blockage of blood vessels in replanted fingers or toes after amputation injuries 
Background 
Microvascular surgery refers to any surgery involving small‐sized blood vessels that is performed under the operating microscope, allowing, for example, for the repair of arteries and veins of amputated parts to the body. These vessels are typically 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. Replantation is the reattachment of a completely detached body part, with fingers and thumbs being the most commonly replanted body parts. This is often referred to as digital replantation. In principle, digital replantation involves not only restoring the blood flow through the arteries and veins but also restoring the bony skeleton of the toes, fingers or thumbs, along with repairing the tendons and nerves, if necessary. Occlusion (blockage) of one or more of the repaired vessels due to the formation of a clot within the blood vessel can result in failure of the replantation. Anticoagulant medications are used to reduce clotting, and they could potentially prevent such a complication. Anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) have therefore been used to prevent clot formation after digital replantation. It is unclear if low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has similar benefit. 
Key results 
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical study in which people have an equal chance of receiving the treatment or a comparator. This systematic review identified four RCTs comparing LMWH with either UFH or no LMWH. The trials included a total of 258 people with at least 273 replanted fingers or toes (digits). The evidence is up‐to‐date to 17 March 2020. The trials differed in which results they reported and how they reported them, so we could not combine all the information.
