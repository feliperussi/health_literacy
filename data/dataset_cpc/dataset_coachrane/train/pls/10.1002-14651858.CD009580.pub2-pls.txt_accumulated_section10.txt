Fibrates for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke
Review question 
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of fibrates for the prevention of major events including heart attacks, strokes, and circulatory disease death in people with existing circulatory disease. 
Background 
Fibrates have been used for many years as a treatment to prevent further heart attacks and strokes in people who already have disease of their circulatory system. Fibrates are a class of drugs that work by positively influencing fats in the the blood, that is lowering triglyceride, raising high‐density lipoprotein ('good') cholesterol and lowering the small dense fraction of low‐density lipoprotein ('bad') cholesterol. The drug class includes clofibrate, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate. Successful adjustment of the blood fats in people with disease of their circulatory system could mean these individuals are less likely to have heart attacks, stroke, and die from their circulatory disease. There is currently no clear evidence for benefit of fibrates in such people. 
Study characteristics 
The duration of fibrates ranged from 12 months to 8 years.
Key results 
We included 13 trials in this review with a total of 16,112 participants with a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. This review includes evidence identified up to October 2014. 
Our analysis showed that when compared primarily to placebo, fibrates can be effective for prevention of composite outcome of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction), and death due to circulatory disease. However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion on data from clofibrates, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 because of safety concerns. In other words, there is no good evidence to support the use of currently available fibrates in the prevention of future heart attacks, strokes, and circulatory disease death in people with existing circulatory disease.
