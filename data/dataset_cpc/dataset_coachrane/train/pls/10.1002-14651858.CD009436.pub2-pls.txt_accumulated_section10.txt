Complementary therapies for acne vulgaris
Background 
Acne is a chronic skin disease, which causes spots to occur simultaneously on several areas of the body, including the face, neck, back, and chest. Besides the current commonly used treatments, complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are of increasing interest to people who often use them in addition to conventional treatments as additive or single therapies to treat acne. 
The review question 
Can any complementary therapies improve the clinical symptoms of acne vulgaris?
Study characteristics 
We searched relevant databases and trials registers up to 22 January 2014. We identified 35 randomised controlled trials, with 3227 participants, which used 6 kinds of CAM (herbal medicine, acupuncture, wet cupping, diet, purified bee venom, and tea tree oil). A pharmaceutical company funded one trial; the other trials did not report their funding sources. 
Key results 
For our primary outcome, we combined two studies that compared a low‐ with a high‐glycaemic‐load diet (LGLD, HGLD), but found no clear evidence of a difference between the 2 groups at 12 weeks for a change in non‐inflammatory lesion counts. Only one of these two trials provided usable data to show potential benefit of LGLD for reducing inflammatory and total skin lesion counts. Tea tree oil and pollen bee venom were found to reduce total skin lesion counts in single trials, respectively. The remaining 31 included trials gave mixed results about whether complementary therapies might reduce the total number of skin lesion counts. 
Twenty‐six trials reported adverse events. The herbal medicine group found some mild side‐effects, such as nausea, diarrhoea, and stomach upset. The acupuncture group found some itch or redness and pain following needle insertion. Participants who used tea tree oil reported itchiness, dryness, and flaking of the skin. None of the trials reported severe adverse effects.
