Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other medicines or herbs for chronic hepatitis B 
Review question 
To assess the benefits and harms of Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus other medicines or herbs in people with chronic hepatitis B. 
Background 
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common liver disease, associated with high morbidity (illness) and death. It causes psychological stress and is a burden to people with chronic hepatitis B and their families. Radix Sophorae flavescentis is for treating people with chronic hepatitis B as it is believed that it decreases discomfort and prevents the replication of the virus in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, the benefits and harms are still unclear.

Study characteristics 
We included 10 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 898 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias. The trials covered oral capsules, intravenous (into a vein) infusion, intramuscular (into a muscle) injection, and acupoint (a specifically chosen site of acupuncture) injection of Radix Sophorae flavescentis with treatment duration from 1 month to 12 months. Radix Sophorae flavescentis was compared with lamivudine, adefovir, interferon, tiopronin, thymosin, and other Chinese herbs. Two trials included children up to 14 years old. Participants in one trial had cirrhosis (late stage of scarring of the liver) in chronic hepatitis B. 
Study funding sources 
Two of the 10 trials were not funded, and one received governmental funding. The remaining seven trials provided no information on funding. Undisclosed funding may have influence on trial results and lead to poor design of the trial.
