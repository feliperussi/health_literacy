Does the speed of injection make a difference in the amount of pain and bruising in people receiving heparin injections? 
Background 
Heparin is a drug used to help stop blood from clotting. It comes in two forms: unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH has a longer half‚Äêlife (the time it takes for the concentration of a drug in the body to be reduced by 50%) and fewer side effects compared to UFH. Heparin is usually given by injection just underneath the skin, going into the layer of fat under the skin so that it is released slowly into the body. This type of injection can sometimes cause bruising and pain at the site where the needle is inserted. Bruising occurs when the small blood vessels and capillaries break and bleed under the skin and lead to discolouration of the skin. This bleeding can sometimes worsen and cause a swelling, known as a haematoma, that occurs when blood collects in the injury site. Several studies have been carried out to find out if the speed of injection affects the amount of pain and bruising at the site where the injection is given. Study investigators think that slow injection of heparin allows time for tissue under the skin to accommodate the injected volume, resulting in reduced pressure, capillary bleeding, and site pain intensity, thereby minimising the likelihood of bruising at the injection site. However, the results of studies differ, and study authors have not reached a clear final conclusion.
