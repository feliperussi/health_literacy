Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence 
Why is this review important? 
Dementia currently affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide and there is an expectation that, as people are growing older, there will be a substantial increase in the number of people affected. Dementia literature argues for the need to address the complexity of the symptoms and work with the person as a whole. It is possible that dance movement therapy, an embodied psychological intervention that uses movement and dance to express and explore emotions, may be useful for people with dementia. However, its effectiveness remains unclear. This is the first review of the effectiveness of dance movement therapy for dementia and will add to the evidence base regarding available non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for dementia. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
It is expected that this review will be of interest to people affected by dementia and their carers as well as general practitioners, mental health professionals and psychological therapists. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
We asked the following questions. Is dance movement therapy more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is dance movement therapy more effective than any other treatment? How effective are different types of dance movement therapy? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of dance movement therapy for dementia up to March 2016, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. No study met the inclusion criteria.
