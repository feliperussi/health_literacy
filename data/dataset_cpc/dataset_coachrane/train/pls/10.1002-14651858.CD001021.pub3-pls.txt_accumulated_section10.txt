Inhaling antibiotics to treat lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the benefit of inhaled antibiotics against persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which results in abnormal mucus in several parts of the body. The main part of the body affected is the lungs which are susceptible to infection by certain bacteria. Infection causes inflammation which results in progressive damage to the lungs. As people with cystic fibrosis get older, they are more likely to become infected on a long‚Äêterm basis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in people with CF. 
We wanted to find out whether antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa would reduce the effects of infection when they are inhaled into the lungs. We wanted to learn whether this treatment would improve lung function, quality of life and survival. We also looked for any harmful effects.

Trial characteristics 
The review included 18 trials with 3042 people with cystic fibrosis aged between five and 56 years of age. The trials lasted from three months to 33 months. Eleven of these trials compared inhaled antibiotics with placebo (an inhaled substance without the medication in it) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Eight of the trials compared one inhaled antibiotic with either a different inhaled antibiotic or a different schedule of the same inhaled antibiotic. One of the trials compared an antibiotic to placebo as well as to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups.
