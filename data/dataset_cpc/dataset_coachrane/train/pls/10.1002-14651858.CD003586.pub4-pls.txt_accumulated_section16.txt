Non‐drug treatments for spatial neglect/inattention following stroke or adult brain injury 
What is the review about?Spatial neglect, or inattention, is a condition that affects many brain injury survivors, particularly stroke survivors. It reduces a person's awareness of one side of the body or of the surrounding environment. This can affect a person's ability to carry out many everyday tasks such as eating, reading, and getting dressed, which can reduce independence. 
What did we want to know?We wanted to find out if non‐drug treatments:• improve patients' ability to complete daily living activities; and• reduce spatial neglect. 
What did we do?We reviewed evidence from randomised trials ‐ studies that compared one treatment to another by randomly assigning people with stroke or brain injury to one or the other treatment. 
Evidence from 1966 to October 2020 was reviewed.
What evidence did we find?We found 65 studies involving 1951 participants. 
All studies included participants with spatial neglect as a result of stroke. It is surprising that only one study included three participants with spatial neglect caused by another type of brain injury. 
All studies included participants with right‐sided damage to the brain; seven studies also included participants with left‐sided damage. 
Studies were considered small, with 4 to 69 participants (average 30). Eight studies included 50 or more participants; four studies involved 10 or fewer. 
None of the studies reported any patient or public involvement in how the studies were designed, conducted, or reported. 
We categorised the studies into eight different types of treatments.
• Visual treatment: 17 studies involving 398 participants explored visual treatments. All treatments encouraged eye movement or scanning by a range of methods including paper‐based tasks, computer activities, and daily living activities. 
• Prism adaptation training: 8 studies involving 257 participants explored prism adaptation training. This involved participants wearing glasses with prism lenses during a pointing activity. 
• Body awareness treatments: 12 studies involving 447 participants explored body awareness treatments. These studies involved various physical, visual, or verbal prompting or cueing aimed at increasing awareness of the affected side. 
• Mental function treatments: 7 studies involving 170 participants explored treatments that focused on mental processing/thinking (e.g. mental imagery, virtual reality). 
• Movement treatments: 6 studies involving 220 participants explored treatments that used movement of the arm or the whole body. These included the use of robotics, visual and motor feedback, and restricting movement on the side of the body that was not affected.
