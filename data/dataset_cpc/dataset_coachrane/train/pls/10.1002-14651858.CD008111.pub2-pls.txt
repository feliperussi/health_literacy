Surgical removal of the thymus for myasthenia gravis that is not caused by a tumour of the thymus 
Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes muscle weakness and excessive muscle tiredness. In most people with myasthenia gravis, muscles throughout the body are affected in the first two years after the onset of symptoms, although there is also a form of the disease that affects only the eyes (ocular myasthenia). Myasthenia gravis occurs when the person’s own immune system attacks the vital structures that transmit impulses from nerves to muscle, the neuromuscular junctions. A tumour affecting an immune system organ called the thymus (a thymoma) is sometimes the underlying cause; this is known as thymomatous myasthenia gravis. Thymomatous myasthenia gravis was not the subject of this systematic review as the thymoma should be treated on its own merit, independently of the myasthenia gravis. 
Some observational studies suggest that removal of the thymus (thymectomy) might be useful in people with myasthenia gravis who do not have a thymoma (non‐thymomatous myasthenia gravis). It is generally accepted that thymectomy should not be used in ocular myasthenia, although some people think that it could be used when there is no response to medical therapy. In our systematic review of the evidence we did not find any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of thymectomy in non‐thymomatous myasthenia gravis. At present, as there is no RCT, the value of thymectomy is a subject of controversy and medical practice varies among practising physicians. An RCT is required to find out whether thymectomy is effective in generalized myasthenia gravis.
