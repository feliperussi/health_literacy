Routine antibiotics at cesarean section to reduce infection
Women undergoing cesarean section have a five to 20‐fold greater chance of getting an infection compared with women who give birth vaginally. These infections can be in the organs within the pelvis, around the surgical incision and sometimes the urine. The infections can be serious, and very occasionally can lead to the mother’s death. The potential benefits of reducing infection for the mother need to be balanced against any adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, skin rash and rarely allergic reactions in the mother, and any effect of antibiotics on the baby, including thrush. This review looked at whether antibiotics are effective in preventing infection in women having a cesarean section. It also studied the effect of giving the antibiotics before or after the cord is clamped and different kinds of antibiotics. The review found 95 studies involving over 15,000 women. Routine use of antibiotics at cesarean section reduced the risk of wound and womb infections in mothers as well as the risk of serious complications of infections for the mothers by 60% to 70%. This was so whether the cesarean section was planned (elective) or not, and whether the antibiotics were given before or after clamping of the umbilical cord. The evidence to support antibiotic treatment was of moderate quality but often the way the study was done was not described well enough. None of the studies looked properly at possible adverse effects on the baby and so, although there are benefits for the mother, there is some uncertainty about whether there are any important effects on the baby.
