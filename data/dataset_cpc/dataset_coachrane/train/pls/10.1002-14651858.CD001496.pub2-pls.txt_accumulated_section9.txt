Treatment of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease to help manage asthma in adults and children 
Background 
People with asthma are three times more likely to have reflux (where acid from the stomach comes back up the oesophagus) than healthy people. Reflux may be a trigger for asthma, or alternatively, asthma may trigger reflux. Treatments that can help reflux include drugs that reduce stomach acids or improve stomach emptying. Research studies have found inconsistent benefit for improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function. Although asthma may be improved in some people, it was not possible to predict who might benefit. 
Review question 
This review aimed to investigate if treatment for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) would benefit adults and children with asthma. 
Study characteristics 
To answer this question, we looked for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing GORD treatment (medical and/or surgical intervention) to placebo or no treatment in adults or children who had been diagnosed as having both asthma and GORD. 
Key results 
We found 23 studies for inclusion in this review. These studies focused mostly on adults, with a total of 2872 participants involved. Only two studies assessed the effects of treating GORD in children, and two investigated the benefits of using surgery for GORD to improve asthma control. According to evidence presented in this review, using medication to treat GORD in people with asthma probably reduces the amount of rescue medication needed to control asthma symptoms and also probably improves lung function to a small degree. It is important to note that these benefits may be too small to make an impact on the daily life of someone with asthma.
