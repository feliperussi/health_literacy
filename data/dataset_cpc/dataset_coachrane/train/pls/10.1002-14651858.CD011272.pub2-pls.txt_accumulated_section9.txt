Drugs that aim to relieve clinical symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of rapamycin or rapalogs for reducing the severity of clinical symptoms in people with tuberous sclerosis complex. 
Background 
Tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disease caused by mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or tuberous sclerosis complex 2 genes that affects several organs such as the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs and skin. The incidence has been reported to be one in approximately 6000. Previous studies have shown potential benefits of rapamycin or rapalogs for treating people with tuberous sclerosis complex. Although everolimus (a rapalog) is currently approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) for tumours associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma), the use of these drugs for treating other symptoms of the condition has yet to be established. This review aims to bring together clinical trials in this area to establish the clinical value of rapamycin and rapalogs for various symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex.

Study characteristics 
The review included three studies with 263 people with tuberous sclerosis complex aged between 0.8 and 61 years of age. However, one study involved five people with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (without tuberous sclerosis complex) which we could not remove from the analysis. Studies compared rapamycin or rapalogs with placebo and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The duration of the studies was variable. Two of the included studies were funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
