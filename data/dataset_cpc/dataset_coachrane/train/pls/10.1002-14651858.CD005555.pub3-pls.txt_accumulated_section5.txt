What are the benefits and risks of lens extraction in treating chronic primary angle‐closure glaucoma? 
Why is this question important?Primary angle‐closure glaucoma (PACG) is a type of glaucoma which is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. It occurs when there are problems with fluid drainage from the eye because the iris (the colored part of the eye) has blocked the drainage channels. A blockage can happen suddenly (acute PACG) or gradually (chronic PACG), causing a build‐up of fluid and raising the pressure inside the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. Treatment options include eye drops, laser treatment, and surgery. 'Lens extraction' is a type of surgery where the natural lens is replaced with an artificial lens. This also has the effect of opening up the drainage channels and may help to treat PACG. We reviewed the research evidence to find out how lens extraction compares to other treatments for chronic PACG. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared lens extraction with other treatments for chronic PACG, compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find?We found eight studies comprising 513 eyes with chronic PACG that met our inclusion criteria. The studies followed participants for six to 69 months, and compared lens extraction against: 
‐ laser therapy;‐ lens extraction plus an injection of thick liquid to break iris adhesions with the aim of encouraging fluid outflow (viscogonioplasty, VGP);‐ lens extraction plus breaking the iris adhesions mechanically, known as goniosynechialysis (GSL);‐ trabeculectomy (creating a flap to facilitate fluid drainage); and‐ lens extraction plus trabeculectomy.
