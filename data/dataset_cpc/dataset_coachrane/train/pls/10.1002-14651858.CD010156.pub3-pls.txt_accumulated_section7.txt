Dietary supplements for chronic gout
What is gout, and what are dietary supplements? 
Gout is caused by crystal formation in the joints, due to high uric acid levels in the blood. People have attacks of painful, warm, and swollen joints, often in the big toe. Some people develop a large buildup of crystals just beneath the skin, known as tophi. A cure can be achieved if uric acid levels in the blood return to normal for a prolonged time, making the crystal deposits dissolve. 
Dietary supplements are preparations, such as vitamins, essential minerals, and probiotics. Few studies evaluate their benefits, fewer evaluate their harmful side effects. 
Study characteristics 
This review is an update of the original review, published in 2014. After searching the medical literature up to August 2020, we found no new studies this time. We kept the two studies from the original review. 
One study (120 participants) compared enriched skim milk powder (with peptides that are thought to probably have an anti‐inflammatory effect) to standard skim milk, and to lactose powder, to try to reduce the frequency of gout attacks. The second study (40 participants) compared vitamin C with allopurinol – a drug commonly used in gout in an effort to reduce the uric acid levels in blood. Both studies enrolled people with gout who were predominantly middle‐aged men. In the skim milk study, participants appeared to have severe gout, as they had frequent attacks, and 20% to 43% presented with tophi. Participants in the vitamin C study appeared similar to ordinary people with gout.
