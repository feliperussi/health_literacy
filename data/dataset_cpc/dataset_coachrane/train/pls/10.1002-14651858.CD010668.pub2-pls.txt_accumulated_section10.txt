What are the benefits and risks of belimumab for treating systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease that affects the whole body)? 
Why is this question important? 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; or ‘lupus’) is a disease in which the body's immune (defense) system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. It is a long‐term disease (one that lasts longer than six weeks and is usually life‐long). Often, SLE causes pain in joints and muscles, and extreme tiredness. Symptoms can improve temporarily, or worsen suddenly (flares). 
There is no cure for SLE. However, treatments can improve symptoms. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. Most people are treated with glucocorticoids (anti‐inflammation medicines; also called "steroids/prednisone/medrol/solumedrol") at some point in their disease course. These medicines reduce the swelling and pain associated with inflammation, but they can have serious adverse (unwanted) effects, such as kidney damage. This is why it is important to study other treatment options, such as belimumab. 
Belimumab is a human protein (antibody) that is given as an injection to decrease inflammation. In people with SLE, belimumab prevents the development and survival of the cells that attack the body’s healthy tissues (B cells). The aim of belimumab is to reduce the number of B cells, so that people’s symptoms improve. 
To find out about the benefits and risks of belimumab, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know how belimumab affects: 
‐ disease intensity;
‐ health‐related quality of life;
‐ use of glucocorticoids; and
‐ adverse effects, including: serious effects (for example, diseases that affect kidneys or the nervous system), serious infections (since anti‐inflammation medicines reduce the body’s ability to fight infections), adverse effects that led people to withdraw from studies, and death.
