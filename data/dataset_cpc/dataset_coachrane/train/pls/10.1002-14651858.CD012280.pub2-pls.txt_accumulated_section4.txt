Exercise training interventions for people with cancer during cancer treatment before or after surgery 
Background  People who are diagnosed with cancer will often undergo intensive treatment in the hope of achieving a cure. Such treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy, frequently given in combination. These treatments can cause side effects (adverse effects), for example, making people feel less fit and more tired, and decreasing their quality of life. These adverse effects may be prevented, or at least reduced, if people with cancer undertake an exercise training programme during cancer treatment. In the past, people with cancer were told to rest, but current recommendations are to stay as active as possible. 
Review question In adult patients undergoing cancer surgery, what is the impact of exercise training versus usual care on fitness, safety, quality of life, fatigue (tiredness), and clinical outcomes? 
Key results We included 11 studies involving 1067 participants, published up until October 2018. The majority of people (73%) received treatment for breast cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to receive an exercise programme or usual care (no exercise training). The included studies suggested that exercise training may make little or no difference to physical fitness levels. The included studies also highlighted that it is probably safe to exercise, as the number of adverse events were low. The findings also showed that exercise training may make little or no difference to quality of life, but that it probably reduces fatigue (tiredness). We do not know whether it improves postoperative recovery, as no study reported this.
