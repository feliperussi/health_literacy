Interventions for the restoration of teeth that have been weakened by the absence of enough covering of enamel, caused by amelogenesis imperfecta 
Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a tooth development disorder in which the teeth are covered with thin, abnormally formed enamel. The enamel is easily fractured and damaged, which affects the appearance of the teeth, especially if left untreated. Negative psychological outcomes, due to compromised appearance and function, in patients with AI, have been found to affect a person's attractiveness and reduce social interaction. Early and appropriate preventive and restorative care is essential for successful management of AI and for a person's psychological well being. 
The treatment used depends on the severity of the problem. Crowns are sometimes used to improve the appearance of the teeth and protect them from damage. 
This review undertaken by the Cochrane Oral Health Group set out to compare the success rates of different restorative materials and techniques used for the restoration of front and back teeth affected by AI. The review was to assess patient satisfaction, particularly how the teeth looked, how sensitive they were and how well they functioned. 
The most recent search of existing studies was undertaken on 18 April 2013. Randomised controlled trials were sought in which restorations of teeth affected by AI were compared with regard to patient satisfaction and function. Children and adolescents under 18, who had AI and required restorative care, were selected for inclusion irrespective of their nationality. This review found no trials which met the inclusion criteria.
