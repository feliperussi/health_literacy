Dialysate temperature reduction for intradialytic hypotension for people with chronic kidney disease requiring haemodialysis 
What is the issue? 
An increasing number of patients with chronic kidney disease need haemodialysis (HD). When the kidneys are not able to remove enough waste from the blood, HD is used to clean the blood and to remove the excess water via a dialysis machine. Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication of HD that is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure (BP) with hypotensive symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, nausea, and fatigue, and is a risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In general, a decrease in body temperature is associated with contraction of vessels, and an increase in BP. However, the widely used dialysate temperature is 37°C, and the body temperature is likely to increase during standard dialysis. Removal of heat with cool dialysate might be beneficial to haemodynamic stability. Additionally, fixed empirical reduction of dialysate temperature is simple and easy to adopt in daily practice, however it can increase patient discomfort such as cold sensations, shivering, and related symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We collected all data from studies of patients with CKD requiring HD that reported data on IDH, discomfort rate and other important outcomes. We included 25 studies comprising 712 participants in the review, and performed meta‐analysis to estimate the effect of cooling dialysate. 
What did we find? 
The quality of included studies was generally very low due to the risk of bias, small sample size, and a lack of information.
