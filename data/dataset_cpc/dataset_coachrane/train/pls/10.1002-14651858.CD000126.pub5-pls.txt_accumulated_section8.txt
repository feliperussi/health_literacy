Is local or general anaesthesia better during surgery to widen the main blood vessel to the brain when it becomes narrowed (carotid endarterectomy)? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence does not show any clear difference between local anaesthesia (where the patient remains awake) and general anaesthesia for the risk of stroke, death, or other unwanted effects for people having surgery to widen a narrowed carotid artery (carotid endarterectomy). 
‐ Future studies should recruit more people, analyse and publish information from all of them, and make sure that the researchers assessing the outcomes do not know which type of anaesthetic people had. 
What is a carotid endarterectomy? 
A stroke happens when blood stops flowing to any part of your brain. The carotid artery is the main vessel supplying blood to the brain. This artery can become narrowed due to fatty deposits that build up over time. Around 1 in 5 strokes is caused by narrowing of the carotid artery. Blood clots can form at the point of narrowing. If a blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream, it can be carried into the brain, where it blocks the blood supply and causes a stroke. 
A surgical operation – carotid endarterectomy – removes the inner lining, fatty deposits and any blood clots in the carotid artery and can lower the risk of stroke. However, even with very careful surgery, approximately 1 in 20 people will suffer a stroke caused by the operation itself. 
Anaesthetics are medicines that prevent people feeling pain. Surgeons can use either a local anaesthetic, where an area of the body is numbed, or general anaesthetic, where a person is put to sleep. The use of a local anaesthetic rather than a general anaesthetic might lower the risk of a stroke during or after carotid endarterectomy surgery.
