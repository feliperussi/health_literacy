Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults
Tinnitus can be described as a perception of sound that is not related to an external acoustic source. Subjective tinnitus is not heard by anyone else but the sufferer. At present no particular treatment for tinnitus has been found effective in all patients. 
Sound therapy (also known as masking devices) was introduced on the principle of distraction ‐ if sound, usually 'white noise' (similar to the noise made by an out of tune radio) is played it may be sufficient to distract a patient from hearing the noises produced by their tinnitus; the new sound will mask out the patient's tinnitus sounds. 
The objective of this review was to assess whether sound therapy is effective in the management of patients suffering from tinnitus. 
Six trials (553 participants) were included in this review. Following analysis of the data, no significant change was seen in the loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnitus following the use of sound therapy compared to other interventions such as patient education, 'relaxation techniques', 'tinnitus coping strategies', counselling, 'tinnitus retraining' and exposure to environmental sounds. No side effects were reported from the use of sound‐creating devices. 
The limited data from the studies included in the review failed to show strong evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in tinnitus management, however the absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. There is a lack of quality research in this area and also combined approaches (hearing therapy plus counselling) are commonly used in the management of tinnitus. Optimal management of tinnitus may involve multiple strategies.
