Does more support increase success amongst people using medications to quit smoking?
Background 
Medications (including all types of nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline) have been shown to help people quit smoking, and people who want help to quit will often be offered medication (pharmacotherapy). Behavioural support also helps people to quit. Behavioural support may include brief advice or more intensive counselling, and may be provided face‐to‐face on a one‐to‐one basis or in groups, or by telephone, including 'quitlines'. It has been unclear how much additional benefit is gained from adding support, or providing more intensive support for people who are using medication to help them quit. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for studies that included smokers and provided or offered medication to everyone. People in the studies were then randomly split into groups which received different amounts or kinds of behavioural support. To assess whether the support given helped people to quit, the studies had to count the number of people not smoking after six months or more. We did not look at studies that only included pregnant women. 
Key results 
We searched for studies in June 2018. We included 83 studies, with almost 30,000 people. Most studies included people who wanted to quit smoking, but a small number of studies offered support to people who were not trying to quit. Combining results from 65 trials suggested that increasing the amount of behavioural support for people using a stop‐smoking medication increases the chances of quitting smoking. About 17% of people in the groups receiving less or no support quit smoking, compared to about 20% in the groups receiving more support. Providing some support via personal contact, face‐to‐face or telephone, is helpful. Few studies compared different types of support. More research is needed to find out if some types of behavioural support help more people using medication to quit smoking.
