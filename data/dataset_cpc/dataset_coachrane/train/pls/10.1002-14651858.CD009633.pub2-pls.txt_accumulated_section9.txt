Clonidine premedication for postoperative pain in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving clonidine before anaesthesia (that is, as a premedication) on postoperative pain in children. 
Background 
Pain after operations remains a major problem for children undergoing surgery. Premedication is the practice of giving a drug to reduce anxiety or provide sedation, or both, prior to anaesthesia. Premedications can also be used to provide pain relief after surgery. Clonidine is sometimes used as a premedication as it is believed to have some useful effects such as pain relief, sedation, and reducing anxiety. We investigated whether clonidine premedication provides pain relief after surgery in children. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to December 2012. We identified a total of 11 controlled studies, including a total of 742 children, where clonidine was compared to another medication or to a dummy treatment (placebo). 
Key results 
We found evidence that when clonidine is given at an adequate dose (4 Âµg/kg) it is effective in reducing the need for pain relief after surgery for children (and probably reduces the children's pain) when compared to a placebo. The evidence is less clear when clonidine is compared to the sedative drug midazolam; this is likely to relate to differences in the design of the clinical trials. The side effects of clonidine did not seem to be a significant problem at the doses used, although in some of the studies the investigators took measures to prevent such side effects by the use of other medications.
