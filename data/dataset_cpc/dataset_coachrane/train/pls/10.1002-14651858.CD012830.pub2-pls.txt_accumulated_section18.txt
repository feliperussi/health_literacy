What is the best way to place medicines directly into the eye to widen the pupil during cataract surgery? 
Key messagesWe did not find enough good‐quality evidence about the best way to deliver medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery. We found only one study that had enrolled a large enough number of people to give reliable results. 
Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering these medicines. 
What are cataracts?A cataract starts when cloudy patches develop on the lens of the eyes. As the cloudy patches get bigger over time, sight becomes misty and blurred. Untreated cataracts will lead to blindness. 
Cataract surgerySurgery is the only way to improve a person's eyesight if they have cataracts. A tiny cut is made in the eye, and the old, cloudy lens is removed and a plastic lens put in its place. 
Before and during surgery, doctors use medicines to widen (dilate) the pupil, the dark part in the center of the eye that lets in light. For surgery, the pupil should be as wide as possible to help doctors see and work inside the eye; wide pupils also reduce the chance of problems during surgery. 
Why we did this Cochrane ReviewMedicines used to widen the pupil can be: 
· dropped onto the surface of the eye, as eye drops;
· injected into the eye; or
· released from a tiny device (depot) placed on the surface of the eye beneath the lower eyelid. 
We wanted to find out:
· which way of delivering these medicines worked best to widen the pupil during cataract surgery; 
· which was the most cost‐effective (gave benefits, such as savings in surgery time or costs, that might outweigh any additional costs associated with using it); and 
· about any unwanted effects the delivery method might cause.
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested these different ways of delivering medicines to the eye in people having cataract surgery. 
Search date: We included evidence published up to 22 January 2021. 
What we foundWe found 14 studies in 1652 people (aged 57 to 78 years) who had cataract surgery in 1670 eyes. The studies took place at hospitals in Europe, China, India, and Malaysia. One study reported that it had been sponsored by a company that manufactured one of the depot devices used in the study. 
The studies compared eye drops against injections (7 studies) or depot devices (6 studies); one study compared all three delivery types. Unfortunately, there were too many differences between the study designs and results reported to allow us to make overall estimates of how well each method worked.
