Medical interventions for traumatic hyphema
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out what medical treatments are effective for traumatic hyphema, a condition in which blood collects in the eye following trauma, usually a blow to the eye. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Key messages We found no evidence that any medical intervention affected vision, whether measured within a few weeks or longer. We also found that no medical intervention resulted in fewer complications from the hyphema itself, although this evidence is weak because few events occurred. We found limited evidence that antifibrinolytics, drugs that affect how blood is clotted, reduced the risk of new bleeding in the eye. 
What was studied in the review? It was important to evaluate current medication interventions for traumatic hyphema because complications from the condition can affect final vision. We found 27 studies with a total of 2643 participants addressing this question. Studies were from the USA, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, China, South Africa, Malysia, Iran, and Israel. The studies included more males than females, and participants tended to be children or young adults. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents taken orally or applied directly to the eye (aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), oral or topical corticosteroids, other kinds of eyedrops, aspirin, estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. Most studies looked at how often fresh bleeding occurred, because this secondary bleeding is often associated with more complications. Other outcomes examined included visual acuity and the length of time it took for the blood in the eye to be absorbed.
