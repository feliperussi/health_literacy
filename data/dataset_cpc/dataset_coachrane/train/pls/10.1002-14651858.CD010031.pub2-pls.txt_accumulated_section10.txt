What is the best medication for a fungal infection of the toenail?
Review question 
We aimed to find out which medications, taken by mouth for at least six weeks, are the most effective at curing fungal infection of the toenail, a condition that is known as onychomycosis, in people of any age. We compared these medications to each other or placebo (an inactive drug or treatment). 
Background 
Fungal infection of the toenails is a common condition, which has a low risk of complications and associated health risks. However, for those severely affected, it might affect normal daily activities. 
Medication taken by mouth appears to cure the condition more quickly and effectively than topical treatment. There are three main antifungal medications: griseofulvin, different medications in the azole group (itraconazole, fluconazole, albaconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole), and terbinafine. 
We wanted to assess the following two main outcomes.
1. Does the nail look normal after treatment (clinical cure)? 2. Is the nail free from fungus at a microscopic level (mycological cure)? 
Study characteristics 
We identified 48 studies with 10,200 participants of both sexes. The average age of the participants across studies ranged from 36 to 68; most studies included participants aged 18 and over. Our included studies compared the three main groups of medication against each other or to placebo. Most studies took place in outpatient dermatology settings in the USA and Europe. The participants mainly had fungal infection under the toenails. A small number of studies included a specific group of participants, such as those with diabetes. All but one study looked at fungal infections caused by dermatophyte, which are fungi that digest keratin. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years, with most lasting 12 to 15 months.
