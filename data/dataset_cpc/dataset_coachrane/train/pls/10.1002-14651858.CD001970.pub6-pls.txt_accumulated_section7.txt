Delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds to prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) or very low birth weight (VLBW; less than 1500 grams) newborn babies are at risk of developing a severe bowel disorder called necrotising enterocolitis (where the bowel becomes inflamed and dies). Infants whose growth in the womb is compromised are thought to have a high risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. Very preterm or VLBW infants are initially fed low amounts of milk, with amounts gradually increased over several days. Delaying the introduction and increase in volume of milk feeds for several days (or longer) after birth may be one possible way to reduce the risk of this condition. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for clinical trials assessing the effect of delayed (more than four days after birth) versus earlier introduction of milk feeds (where human milk or formula is fed directly by a tube into the stomach) on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, death and general health in very preterm or VLBW infants. The search is up‐to‐date as of October 2021. 
Key results 
We found 14 trials with 1551 infants participating. About half of these infants had evidence of compromised growth while in the womb. Combined analysis of these trials showed that delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds may not reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death. Delayed feeding may slightly reduce the risk of feed intolerance, but probably increases the risk of serious infection occurring.
