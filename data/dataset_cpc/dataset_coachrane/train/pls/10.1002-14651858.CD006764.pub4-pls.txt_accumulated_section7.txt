Different corticosteroid treatments before early birth for improving outcomes for babies  
What is the issue? 
Babies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy, which is considered preterm birth) are at increased risk of health problems. These include lung problems (respiratory distress syndrome), bleeding of the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage) and death. Medicines called corticosteroids are given to the mother while still pregnant to help stop these problems occurring and there is high‐quality evidence that they are effective in preventing many of these issues. These medicines work by maturing the baby's lungs before birth. There are different types of corticosteroid and they can be given in different ways and in different doses. While we know that giving mothers at risk of early birth corticosteroids has benefits for the baby, we do not know which type of corticosteroid is most beneficial and least harmful for mother and baby. 
Why is this important? 
Since there is no clear or agreed best type or dose, hospitals may vary in how they give this medicine. This review assessed all available evidence from randomised controlled trials (where the treatments people receive are decided at random; these trials usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects) to determine which medicine and way of giving the medicine is best for mother and baby. We  also wanted to find out what effect the medicines have once the babies have grown into children and adults. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 9 May 2022, and identified 18 trials. We checked all trials for trustworthiness and did not include trials where we had doubts. We included 11 trials (2494 women and 2762 babies). One of these trials included over 1500 babies, finished in 2013 and was at low risk of bias. The other trials were smaller, older and at moderate or high risk of bias.
