Shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease with or without calcification
Background 
Rotator cuff disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain, especially at night and when lifting the arm above the head. Calcium deposits may form on the tendons in the shoulder joint. 
Shock wave therapy passes sound or shock waves through the skin to the affected area, and may break up calcium deposits. There is currently no standard dose or treatment regimen. 
Review question 
In people with rotator cuff disease with or without calcific deposits, what are the benefits and harms of shock wave therapy compared to placebo (pretend) or other available treatments? 
Study characteristics 
We included 32 trials (2281 participants), published up to November 2019.
Twelve trials compared shock wave therapy to placebo. Eleven trials compared high‐ and low‐dose shock wave therapy, although dosages varied across trials. Single trials compared shock wave therapy to other treatments including ultrasound‐guided glucocorticoid needling, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), exercise, or no treatment; or different regimens of shock wave therapy. 
Overall, 61% of participants were women, the average age was 52 years, and the average duration of the condition was 33 months. Two trials were funded by manufacturers of shock wave machines. 
Key results for the primary comparison, shock wave therapy versus placebo 
Participant‐reported pain relief of 50% or greater (one trial): 
• four more people out of 100 reported pain relief of 50% or more (ranging from 19 fewer to 26 more). 
42 out of 100 people reported pain relief of 50% or greater with shock wave therapy compared with 38 out of 100 with placebo.
