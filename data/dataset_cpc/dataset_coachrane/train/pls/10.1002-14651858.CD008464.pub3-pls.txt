What is the best treatment for a type of jaw bone cyst called a 'keratocystic odontogenic tumour'? 
Review question 
This review has been conducted to assess the effects of different interventions for the treatment of a particular type of cyst that occurs mainly in the lower jawbone, called a keratocystic odontogenic tumour (KCOT). 
Background 
KCOTs are non‐cancerous but fast‐growing cysts (closed sacs containing either fluid or air) that occur mainly in the lower jawbone. They develop from the remains of a tissue associated with tooth development called the dental lamina. They are quite rare and can occur at any age. 
One of the main problems in treating KCOTs is that if they are removed by surgery, they tend to recur. New cysts may form from any cyst lining that remains after surgery. These recurring cysts grow at a rapid rate. Some reports have stated that 6 out of 10 of these cysts will recur after treatment. Treatment to prevent recurrence can lead to large amounts of bone surrounding the cyst having to be removed.This carries major risks (damage to the nerves in the face, and loss of form and function in the face). Currently uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment option. 
Study characteristics 
Authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 17 March 2015. There were no studies found which met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
This review revealed that there is no high quality evidence for the effectiveness of available treatments and there is therefore a need for further research to help clinicians and patients to make informed choices about treatment options.
