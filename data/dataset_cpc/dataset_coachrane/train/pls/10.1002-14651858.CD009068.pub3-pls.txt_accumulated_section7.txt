Preventing and treating heart complications in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy 
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments used to prevent or treat heart complications in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and X‐linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM)? 
Background 
The protein dystrophin is essential for muscles to work normally. DMD, BMD and XLDCM are inherited muscle diseases caused by changes in the gene that controls production of dystrophin. People with these conditions develop muscle wasting and weakness. In the heart, a lack of dystrophin causes muscle damage and scarring, which over time causes the heart to fail. Eventually the heart chambers enlarge, which is known as dilated cardiomyopathy. This serious complication can be a cause of death. There are a number of possible treatments for heart problems in these muscle conditions. One option is to reduce the workload of the heart with drugs that lower blood pressure (angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors, ACE inhibitors) or slow the heart rate (beta blockers or ivabradine). Another approach is to reduce muscle damage with antioxidants (e.g. idebenone) or medicines that target inflammation (e.g. corticosteroids). Recently, drugs that increase dystrophin have been developed, including ataluren and eteplirsen. 
Study characteristics 
Cochrane Review authors collected all relevant studies to answer their review question. They searched for trials looking to prevent or treat heart complications in people with DMD, BMD or XLDCM. They limited the review to trials that randomly assign participants to one treatment or another, which usually provide the best evidence. They identified five small trials, with a total of 205 participants.
