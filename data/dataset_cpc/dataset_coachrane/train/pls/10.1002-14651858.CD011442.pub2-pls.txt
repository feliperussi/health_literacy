Interventions to address problems with sexual function in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a general term referring to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. People with COPD are thought to be at greater risk of having problems with sexual function than other people their age. These problems can include difficulties getting or maintaining an erection (for men), reduced sexual desire, difficulty achieving orgasm, discomfort during sex, anxiety about performance, or sex not being pleasurable. The aim of this review was to summarise studies that investigated the effects of drugs, physical aids, psychological interventions such as counselling, or educational interventions in order to improve the sexual function or sexual satisfaction of people with COPD and their partners. 
Results 
We found two studies published before December 2014 involving a total of 48 people with COPD (men only) who received a medical intervention for problems with sexual function. These medical interventions included testosterone therapy and oxygen therapy. One of these studies provided low‚Äêquality evidence that testosterone injections help some men with COPD improve their ability to get and maintain an erection. However, there was not enough information to evaluate whether testosterone therapy improved overall sexual satisfaction or resulted in other health problems, or whether oxygen therapy improved erectile dysfunction for men with COPD. 
Conclusion 
Currently health professionals need to rely on research involving people without COPD and on expert opinion when making decisions about how best to advise people with COPD regarding problems with sexual function or sexual satisfaction. Considerably more research needs to be conducted in this area of clinical practice.
