Intragastric balloon for obesity
With the failure of conventional treatments like diet therapy, increased physical activity and drug therapy in producing long lasting weight loss in people with obesity, other approaches like surgery are performed in specialised centres, an option to be considered for patients with morbid obesity who do not respond to clinical treatment. The silicon intragastric balloon (IGB) has been developed as a temporary aid to especially achieve weight loss in obese people with 40% or more their optimal weight, who have had unsatisfactory results in their treatment for obesity, despite of being cared for by a multidisciplinary team and in super obese patients who often have a high risk for surgery. The placement and removal of the IGB is an interventionist endoscopic procedure and the balloon is designed to float freely inside the stomach, its size might be changed during the placement. The IGB technique reduces the volume of the stomach and leads to a premature feeling of satiety  Nine randomised controlled trials involving 395 patients were evaluated. Six out of nine studies had a follow‐up of less than one year, the longest study duration was 24 months. The overall quality of trials was variable, only a third of the analysed studies showed a low risk of bias. No information was available on quality of life, all‐cause mortality and morbidity. Compared with conventional management, IGB did not show convincing evidence of a greater weight loss. The relative risks for minor complications, for example gastric ulcers and erosions were significantly raised.
