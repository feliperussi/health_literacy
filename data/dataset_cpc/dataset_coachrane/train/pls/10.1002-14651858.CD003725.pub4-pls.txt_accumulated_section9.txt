Corticosteroid therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
Is there new evidence for benefit from corticosteroids for prolongation of walking, and improving muscle strength and functional abilities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), particularly over the long term (more than two years)? Are different corticosteroids, or different regimens equally effective, with similar side effect profiles? 
Background 
DMD is an incurable disease beginning in childhood that almost exclusively affects boys. Muscle wasting and loss of walking lead to wheelchair dependence and early death. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that corticosteroids improve muscle strength and function for up to six months and strength up to two years (evidence on function at two years is limited). Data from other study types suggest that corticosteroids produce better function over a five‐year period in many patients. Overall, long‐term benefit remains unclear, and has to be weighed against long‐term side effects. It is also unclear whether different corticosteroids differ greatly in side effects. Earlier versions of this review found insufficient evidence to determine whether an intermittent regimen is as effective as a daily regime, or produces fewer side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies of corticosteroid treatment in DMD, involving a total of 667 randomised boys; two other studies are ongoing. Among the 12 completed studies, the treatments were: a corticosteroid versus inactive medicine (placebo) (in nine trials); daily versus weekend‐only prednisone (in one trial); and deflazacort versus prednisone (in three trials). Some studies included more than one comparison; some were not fully reported or provided results that could not be analysed. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
One trial, a two‐year study comparing a corticosteroid (deflazacort) with placebo, assessed the effects of corticosteroids on the ability to continue walking, but the data were not suitable for analysis. Most studies did not report ability to continue walking.
