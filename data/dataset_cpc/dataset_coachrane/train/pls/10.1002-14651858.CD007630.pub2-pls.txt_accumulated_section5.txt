Surgical removal of bony wall or orbital fat for thyroid eye disease
Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting 30% to 50% of patients with Graves' disease. Severe forms present in 3% to 5% of patients with reduced vision due to pressure on the optic nerve. The disease is more frequent in women and it significantly impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The clinical presentation is characterised by inflammation of the orbital contents which increases the volume of fat and muscles, resulting in forward placement of the eyes (exophthalmos), retraction of the eyelids and double vision. Multiple surgical procedures may be required for correction after initial medical treatment has proven ineffective. 
Orbital decompression is achieved by removing bony wall (usually medial, inferior, lateral, or combination), orbital fat or both. It is an established procedure to correct exophthalmos for visual improvement in patients with optic neuropathy (damage to the optic nerve; in thyroid eye disease this is as a result of enlarged muscles compressing the optic nerve), corneal involvement due to inability to close the lids and for rehabilitating patients with marked anterior positioning of the eyes. 
The literature suggests that three‐wall decompressions were chosen for patients with high degrees of proptosis and two‐wall for those with less exophthalmos. Fat removal in addition to bone removal may increase the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. 
Several approaches with contradicting results have been published in the literature. Comparison of different procedures has been biased by inclusion of different indications and outcome measures, in different stages of the disease.
