Postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction after radical hysterectomy in women with early‐stage cervical cancer 
The issueRadical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus (womb) with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) is the treatment for early‐stage cervical cancer (when cancer is still within the cervix and upper vagina, without spread into nearby tissues). Bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) is a common problem following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to the nerves controlling urination. 
The aim of the reviewTo assess the usefulness and safety of treatment to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early‐stage cervical cancer. We searched the scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently) published to April 2020. 
Main findingsWe found four studies that met the inclusion criteria. One study compared a medication called bethanechol to placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect, used as a control in testing drugs). Three studies compared suprapubic catheterisation (insertion of a flexible tube (catheter) into the bladder through a cut in the lower abdomen to drain urine) with intermittent self‐catheterisation (insertion of a catheter via the urethra, into the bladder at intervals throughout the day). 
Bethanechol versus placebo 
Bethanecol may reduce the chance of bladder dysfunction by lowering the volume of post‐void residual urine, assessed at one month after surgery. However, the certainty of this evidence is very low and further studies have the potential to better inform this outcome.
