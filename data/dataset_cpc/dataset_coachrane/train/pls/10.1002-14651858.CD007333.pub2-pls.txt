Early referral to a specialist doctor for people with kidney disease
Some degree of kidney failure affects about 15% to 25% of people and is a silent disease that creeps up on an individual with symptoms and signs developing only very late. When kidney failure becomes end‚Äêstage, life supporting therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation is the only option available for the patient. This form of therapy is very expensive and highly intrusive into the patients' life. Measures to prevent progression to this terminal stage are of great importance to prevent this catastrophe. 
Our analyses of 40 studies of people with chronic kidney disease shows that people referred earlier to a specialist kidney doctor lived longer. Death rates in people referred early were about half of those referred late and these benefits were seen as early as three months and lasted for at least five years. People referred early also spent less time in hospital and were better prepared for dialysis. Dialysis first requires surgical placement of a fistula and early referral to specialist services often means better preparation, a lower risk of infection and other complications. 
We did not discover any adverse effects from early specialist referral. Randomised controlled trials provide the most reliable information of all study designs, so it should be noted that all 40 studies analysed for this review used a cohort design. Cohort studies are the next best level of evidence and the only available evidence. For ethical reasons it is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial that deliberately assigns patients to late specialist referral will ever be conducted.
