Corticosteroids for the management of cancer pain in adults
Background: One of the most feared symptoms associated with cancer is pain. Opioids remain the mainstay of pain treatment but corticosteroids are often used at the same time, along with standard pain relievers. This review evaluates the clinical trial evidence up to 29 September 2014 to determine how effective corticosteroids are in treating cancer‚Äêrelated pain in adults and how well tolerated this treatment is for these patients. 
Study characteristics: We found 15 relevant studies with 1926 participants. The trial size varied from 20 to 598 patients and the duration of the included studies ranged from seven days to 42 weeks. Most studies compared corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, to standard therapy. 
Key results and quality of the evidence: Overall, we found that the current evidence is based on studies that contain only a small number of patients. The following conclusions can be made from the available evidence: 1) the evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids for pain control in cancer patients is weak (GRADE quality of evidence for pain outcome was low); 2) significant pain relief was noted in some studies, albeit only for a short period of time; this could be important for patients who have only a short time to live; 3) overall, more studies found corticosteroids not to be of benefit; 4) it was not possible to determine whether steroids are more effective for pain in specific cancers; and 5) the side effect profile of steroids, especially in the longer term, is not well described.
