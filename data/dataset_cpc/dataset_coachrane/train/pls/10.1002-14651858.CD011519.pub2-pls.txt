Lumbar sympathectomy techniques for critical lower limb ischaemia due to non‐reconstructable peripheral arterial disease 
Background 
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to a common condition of narrowing of the arteries of the lower limbs that restricts blood flow; in the most severe cases, PAD can cause pain at rest, ulcers and gangrene. Amputation may be required if resistant pain or sepsis ensues, unless an intervention is undertaken to improve arterial perfusion (delivery of blood to cells and tissues). One such intervention is lumbar sympathectomy, whereby nerves that stimulate constriction of arteries are destroyed. This is done mainly when other treatments such as reconstruction are not possible and when no treatment would result in amputation. 
Key results 
No randomised controlled trials (current until January 2016) have assessed effects of lumbar sympathectomy by open, laparoscopic and percutaneous methods compared with no treatment or compared with any other method of lumbar sympathectomy in patients with critical lower limb ischaemia (CLI) due to non‐reconstructable peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Our inclusion criteria were based on objective tests proposed by the Second European Consensus document on chronic critical leg ischaemia and the Inter‐Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II). Randomised trials identified by the literature search were performed before such objective criteria for selection were applied and therefore were not eligible for inclusion in the review. High‐quality studies are needed. 
Quality of evidence 
It was not possible to evaluate the quality of evidence in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review.
