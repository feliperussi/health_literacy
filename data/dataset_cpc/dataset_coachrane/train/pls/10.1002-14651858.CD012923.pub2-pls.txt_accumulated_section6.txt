Hybrid versus conventional open surgical repair for thoracic aortic arch aneurysms
Background 
An aortic aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or swelling that occurs in the wall of the aorta. An aneurysm can be classified by its shape, location (sometimes reported as zone) and size. A thoracic aortic arch aneurysm (TAA) is a swelling in the upper portion of the thoracic aorta. The estimated annual incidence (number of new cases in a population over a particular period of time) of TAAs is between 5.6 and 10.4 cases per 100,000 patient‐years. TAAs affect people mostly in the sixth and seventh decade of life and affect men and women equally. Management of TAAs differs by the extent and location of the aneurysm along the aortic arch and the patient’s medical history. TAAs can be treated with either open surgical repair (a surgical procedure requiring partial or total replacement of the diseased aortic arch) or hybrid repair (a surgical procedure which is a less invasive form of open surgical repair). So far, there is no consensus on which type of operation offers the best clinical outcomes in people with TAAs. 
This review aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of hybrid repair compared to open surgical repair in treating TAAs. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched the literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HR compared to OSR for treating TAAs. Our search, current up to March 2021, did not identify any trials that met our inclusion criteria. High‐quality trials are needed to help inform healthcare professionals, policy makers, and patients about the best possible treatment option for people with TAAs.
