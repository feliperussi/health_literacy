Bed rest for treating pressure ulcers (bed sores) among wheelchair users
Background 
Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores) are wounds that occur on the skin or underlying tissues as a result of unrelieved pressure on bony, weight‐bearing points of the body, such as the hips, heels or lower back. People at risk include those with reduced mobility. Wheelchair users are therefore at risk because they remain seated for long periods. Pressure ulcers can be difficult to heal and are prone to infection and other complications. When these wounds occur among wheelchair users, bed rest is considered important to relieve pressure on part of the body that bear weight in a seated position. This change from a sitting to a lying position is thought to improve wound healing. 
Review question 
We wanted to discover the impact of bed rest on the healing of pressure ulcers among people confined to a wheelchair. Eligible studies could involve wheelchair users of any age with a pressure ulcer in any setting (hospital, nursing home, person’s own home etc). 
What we found 
In October 2016 we searched widely through the medical literature for randomised controlled trials comparing bed rest with no bed rest for the healing of pressure ulcers in wheelchair users. We did not find any trials that had been conducted in this area. This means that we cannot say whether bed rest improves the healing of pressure ulcers in wheelchair users, or what the harms and benefits of this treatment might be. Trials are needed that compare pressure ulcer healing with and without bed rest among wheelchair users. 
This plain language summary is up‐to‐date as of October 2016.
