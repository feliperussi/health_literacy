Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for managing pain in people with sickle cell disease 
Review question 
What is the role of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in managing pain in people with sickle cell disease (SCD)? What are the adverse effects of TENS in people with SCD? 
Background. 
SCD is an inherited disorder affecting red blood cells. These cells contain haemoglobin which transports oxygen. The diseased red blood cells block the blood vessels and result in a diminished blood supply, leading to less oxygen reaching affected organs and causing episodes of pain and organ damage. Severe pain requires medication and even hospitalisation. Prescribed painkillers can have several side effects, including drug dependency. Hence researchers are looking for options other than drug treatments for people with SCD. 
TENS is a small battery‐powered electro‐medical device that produces low‐voltage current and is used for pain relief in various painful conditions. It is safe, inexpensive and easy to use. Since mixed responses have been seen in different painful conditions, we felt the need to produce a Cochrane Review with a comprehensive search, to determine the effect of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD.

Study characteristics 
We searched for well‐designed trials to see the effect of TENS compared to 'sham' TENS in people with SCD for relieving pain, reducing the intensity of pain, reducing the frequency of pain episodes, making a difference to the use of painkillers, improving quality of life and for assessing any adverse effects. 
We only found one trial (22 participants aged between 12 and 27 years). The participants were graded into four groups according to how severe their pain was. On the first visit, the participants from different groups were chosen randomly to receive either TENS or ‘sham’ TENS treatment. For a further crisis of the same severity participants were given the alternative intervention to the first one. For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear which treatment they were given.
