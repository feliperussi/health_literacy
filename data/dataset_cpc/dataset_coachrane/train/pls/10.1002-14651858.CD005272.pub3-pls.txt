Behavioral interventions to reduce HIV incidence and HIV/STI prevalence among female sex workers in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
The rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission continue to increase, particularly among sex workers and their clients in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prevention efforts directed towards these infections in this at‐risk population may have had an effect in reducing the overall transmission of HIV/STIs in the general population. Several successful behavioral interventions have been reported including interventions to reduce HIV/STI incidence and prevalence, change behavior, promote condom use, improve condom availability, and increase sexual health knowledge. The review found seven individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two cluster‐RCTs and four quasi‐RCTs involving 8,698 participants examining a variety of behavioral interventions to evaluate whether they reduced HIV/STIs rates or resulted in changed behavior among sex workers and their clients. Results showed that the interventions were effective in HIV/STI prevention, including reducing the incidence and prevalence of HIV and STIs. Furthermore, there were some differences in self‐reported behavior including increased condom use and a reduction in the risk of drug use. However, these trials were small and generally had few participants. As a result, evidence for the effectiveness of social cognitive theory and promoting condom use in reducing HIV/STI incidence compared to other behavioral interventions was limited, because no RCTs examined the effects of these interventions on HIV prevalence or on sex workers other than FSWs. In future research and program agendas therefore it is important to assess other potentially more potent behavioral change strategies.
