Inspections to prevent occupational diseases and injuries
In most countries, government‐related inspectors check if workplaces comply with regulation, such as WorkSafeBC in British Columbia in Canada, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) in the USA or the Labour Inspectorate in other countries. Inspections are costly and do not reach all workplaces. It is unclear how effectively these inspections reduce occupational diseases and injuries. 
To review the evidence on the effect of inspections we searched for studies until January 2013. 
We found 23 studies. Two studies were randomised controlled trials with 1414 workplaces. Fifteen non‐randomised studies analysed injury rates of firms obtained from large administrative databases. Six studies with more than 340 participants in total reported on the opinions of workers or employers. 
Two studies randomly allocated inspections or no inspections to workplaces. After one year follow‐up the non‐fatal injury rate in one study and the frequency of physical overload in the other study were still similar in both study groups. Another five similar but lower quality studies had inconsistent results at short and medium‐term follow‐up. Two other non‐randomised studies found that after more than three years inspections decreased injuries and accidents by 23% compared to no inspections and there was no effect on the firms' productivity. 
Specific inspections resulted in higher compliance rates. Inspections with penalties could result in fewer injuries and more compliance in the short term in small firms. Longer inspections and more frequent inspections probably do not result in more compliance. 
Two studies did not find a harmful effect of inspections on firm lifetime or employment.
Qualitative studies showed that there is support for enforcement among workers. However, workers doubt if inspections are effective because they are rare and violations can be temporarily fixed to mislead the inspectors.
