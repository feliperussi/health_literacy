The effects of using drainage tubes after surgical removal of lymph glands from the groin 
What are lymph glands? 
Lymph glands are part of the body's immune system and swell or enlarge when the body is fighting an infection. They are located in a number of places in the body, including the neck, armpits, and groin. 
Why remove lymph glands? 
Surgical removal of the lymph glands found in the groin (the inguinal lymph nodes) is an important part of the treatment for several types of cancer, including melanoma and other types of skin cancer, as well as squamous cell cancer of the penis, vulva and the surrounding skin. Sometimes complications, such as wound infection, bruising (haematoma) or a collection of lymph fluid in the area (seroma), can occur after removal of these lymph nodes. 
Why insert drainage tubes after surgery? 
Surgeons can insert plastic drainage tubes into the area from which the lymph nodes have been removed. These tubes are inserted towards the end of the operation, once the lymph glands have been removed. The aim of the drainage tubes is to drain away any fluid or blood that may collect in the wounds and cause complications. The drains are usually left in place until the amount of fluid draining out of them in a 24‚Äêhour period has reduced to a certain volume (typically less than 30 mL to 100 mL), although some surgeons will remove the drains at a particular time point after surgery (this can vary from 1 day to more than 1 week). Patients can remain in hospital while the drain is in place, although many surgeons will let patients leave hospital and have the drain managed on an outpatient basis. 
However, it is unclear whether placement of a drainage tube reduces, increases or has no effect on complications following this type of surgery. Furthermore the best timing for removal of drainage tubes is unknown.
