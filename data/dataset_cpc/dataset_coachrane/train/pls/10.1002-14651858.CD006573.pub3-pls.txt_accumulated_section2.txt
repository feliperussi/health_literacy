Antiviral therapy to prevent the recurrence of chronic hepatitis C infection in patients undergoing liver transplantation 
Background  The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food, production of material necessary for congealing, processing and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood, and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut. Hepatitis C virus can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner (chronic hepatitis C virus infection). Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is not able to carry out the normal functions, which results in liver failure. Liver transplantation is effective in treating liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection. However, liver transplantation does not eradicate the virus and the virus can affect the donor liver graft. One of the proposed strategies to prevent the recurrence of chronic hepatitis C infection in these patients is to give drug treatment before the donor liver graft is affected by chronic hepatitis C infection. The effectiveness of these preventive treatments is not known. The review authors performed a detailed review of the medical literature to February 2013 to determine the benefits and harms of different preventive antiviral treatments for patients undergoing liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The review authors sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence. Two review authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.
