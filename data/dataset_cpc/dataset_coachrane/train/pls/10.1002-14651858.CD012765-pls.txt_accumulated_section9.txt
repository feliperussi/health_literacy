Laser therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome
Review question 
What are the effects of low‐level laser therapy (LLLT) for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) when compared to inactive treatment or other non‐surgical treatments? What are the short‐term and long‐term benefits? Are there any harmful effects? 
Background 
CTS is a condition where one of the main nerves in the wrist is compressed. The underlying cause is often unknown. CTS can cause pain, tingling, and numbness in the hand. It is more common as we age and women are more often affected than men. CTS can be treated with surgery, but this is not without risk. For people who do not wish to have surgery, or have a long wait until their operation, other treatments are available. LLLT is one of the non‐surgical treatments available to manage CTS. Use of LLLT is controversial, as some research has shown it to be of benefit whereas other research has not.

Study characteristics 
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question. We found 22 clinical trials that assessed the safety and benefit of LLLT when compared to a placebo (pretend treatment) or another non‐surgical treatment for CTS. Non‐surgical treatments included ultrasound (delivery of sound waves to relieve pain), fascial manipulation (massage of deep connective tissue), application of a pulsed magnetic field, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS; delivery of electrical current through skin to nerves), steroid injection, tendon gliding exercises (to improve the movement of the nerve), and applying a wrist splint combined with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (pain killers that reduce inflammation). The trials involved 1153 participants. Most of these studies had weaknesses that could have compromised their results and caused them to overestimate or underestimate benefits or harms.
