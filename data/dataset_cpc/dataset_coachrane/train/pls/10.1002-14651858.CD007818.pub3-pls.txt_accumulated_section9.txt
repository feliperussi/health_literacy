Treatment for postpolio syndrome
Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments in people with postpolio syndrome (PPS)?
Background 
PPS is a condition that can affect polio survivors years after recovery from an initial paralytic attack by the polio virus. PPS is characterised by progressive or new muscle weakness or decreased muscle endurance in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection and in muscles that were seemingly unaffected. Other symptoms may include generalised fatigue and pain. These symptoms often lead to a decline in physical functioning, for example trouble walking. The objective of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of different drugs and rehabilitation treatments compared to placebo (a pill or procedure without any physiological effect), usual care or no treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases to find all studies on treatments for PPS up to July 2014. We found 13 studies involving a total of 675 participants that were of sufficient quality to include in this review. Ten studies evaluated the effects of drugs (modafinil, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), pyridostigmine, lamotrigine, amantadine, prednisone), and three studies evaluated other treatments (muscle strengthening, rehabilitation in a warm climate (that is temperature ± 25°C, dry and sunny) and a cold climate (that is temperature ± 0°C, rainy or snowy), static magnetic fields). 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
IVIg is a treatment in which antibodies that have been purified from donated blood are given as an infusion into a vein over a period of time. There was moderate‐ and low‐quality evidence that IVIg has no beneficial effect on activity limitations in the short term and long term, respectively. Evidence for effectiveness on muscle strength was inconsistent, as results differed across studies. IVIg caused minor side effects in a substantial proportion of the participants.
