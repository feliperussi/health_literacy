Post‐operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty (knuckle joint replacement) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
This summay of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of post‐operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty. The review shows that in people with RA: 
‐ there was not enough information in the included study to tell whether wearing a hand splint and performing exercises (continuous passive motion) after surgery improves hand function, relieves pain, or corrects deformity. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible complications of knuckle joint replacement may include infection, changes to the bones around the implant, or the chance that the implant could break and cause problems to the hand. It is not known if there are any additional side effects of post‐operative therapy. 
What is RA and what is post‐operative therapy for metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty? 
In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. the small joints of your hands are usually affected first. 
Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthroplasty with implants is the replacement of painful knuckle joints with artificial knuckle joints.The surgery is done because RA can also cause damage to the knuckle joints, making them unable to straighten out and causing them to lean over toward the small finger. 
For eight to 12 weeks after the surgery, patients wear hand splints and perform exercises to maintain and increase motion in the healing hand. This is known as post‐operative therapy.
