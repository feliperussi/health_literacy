Tooth‐colored resin fillings compared with amalgam fillings for permanent teeth at the back of the mouth 
Review question 
This review, carried out within Cochrane Oral Health, describes the effects of tooth‐coloured (composite resin) fillings compared with amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities (holes) in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth. 
Background 
Traditionally, metal fillings made of a silver‐coloured material known as amalgam have been used to treat tooth decay in the back permanent teeth effectively and cheaply; however, due to unhappiness with their metallic look and concerns about the mercury they contain, they are being used less often, particularly in high‐income countries. The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global agreement that has promoted a worldwide reduction in the use of mercury (including amalgam fillings) in order to reduce the impact of mercury on the environment. Tooth‐colored fillings made of a composite resin material have been used as an alternative to amalgam fillings. Initially, they were used only in the front teeth, but as their quality has improved, they have been used in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases until 16 February 2021 and found eight relevant studies. The studies evaluated 3285 composite fillings and 1955 amalgam fillings; however, it is unclear how many participants received these fillings. The exact age of participants was unclear in some studies, but the studies included both children and adults. The studies took place in the UK, the USA, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Turkey.
