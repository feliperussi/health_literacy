Comparison of different techniques for planned opening of the trachea
Review question 
We compared different techniques used for planned opening of the trachea in adult participants hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU). 
Background 
The term 'tracheotomy' refers to the surgical opening of the trachea (windpipe) through the front of the neck. The resulting opening between the trachea and the outer air space (stoma, tracheostomy) allows the person to breathe when the usual route for breathing is somehow obstructed or impaired. Tracheostomy is also necessary for persons in an ICU who are being ventilated by a machine for a long time (i.e. weeks). It is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in intensive care medicine. Both surgical techniques (surgical opening of the trachea) and percutaneous techniques (opening of the trachea with plastic dilators) are widely used in current practice. Compared to surgical tracheostomies, percutaneous tracheostomies seem to have a number of potential advantages. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2015. We included 20 studies from 1990 to 2011, enrolling 1652 adult participants hospitalized in the ICU, who were scheduled for planned tracheotomy. None of the studies were funded. 
Key results 
The application of percutaneous techniques, does not reduce the rate of death, of serious, life‐threatening complications (e.g. injuries to the windpipe or the oesophagus), major bleeding or problems with the tracheostomy tube (blockage, accidental loss, difficult tube change). There was some evidence that using percutaneous techniques results in fewer cases of wound infections (‐ 76%) and unfavourable scarring (‐ 75%).
