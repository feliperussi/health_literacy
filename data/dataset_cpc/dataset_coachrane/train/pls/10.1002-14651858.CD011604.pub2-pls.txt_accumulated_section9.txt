Hydromorphone for neuropathic pain in adults
Bottom line 
There is no good evidence to support or refute the suggestion that hydromorphone works in any neuropathic pain condition. 
Background 
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is often treated by different medicines (drugs) to those used for pain from damaged tissue, which we often think of as painkillers. Medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. But sometimes opioid painkillers are used to treat neuropathic pain. 
Opioid painkillers are drugs like morphine. Morphine is derived from plants, but many opioids are also made by chemical synthesis rather than being extracted from plants. Hydromorphone is one of these synthetic opioids. It is available in numerous countries for use as a painkiller, and can be given by mouth or by injection. 
This review is part of an update of a previous review, Hydromorphone for acute and chronic pain that was withdrawn in 2013 because it needed updating and splitting to be more specific for different pain conditions. This review focuses only on neuropathic pain. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2015, we searched for clinical trials where hydromorphone was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found one small study that did this and met our requirements for the review. The study had a complicated design. Only a minority of participants had neuropathic pain, with only 94 in the comparison with placebo. Important pain outcomes were not reported.
