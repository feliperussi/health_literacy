Birth and death notification via mobile devices: a mixed methods review
What is the aim of this review? 
In this Cochrane Review, we aimed to assess the effect of using mobile devices to notify births and deaths. We also aimed to describe how these mobile solutions are being used in practice and the factors that influence their use. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer these questions. 
Key messages 
We know very little about the effects of using mobile devices to notify births and deaths. Factors that can influence the implementation of this approach include factors tied to the health system and the notification system, the person responsible for notifying, the community, and the families involved. 
What was studied in the review? 
By registering notified births and deaths, governments can track the health of their population, identify needs and problems, and design better services. In many countries, births and deaths are not properly registered. Sometimes this is because government systems are poorly designed to facilitate registration, government workers do not have proper training, people live far from government services, or are not aware of the need to register births or deaths. In many cases, registration is affected by delays in or lack of birth or death notification. 
Governments are starting to use mobile devices such as mobile phones to reduce problems with birth or death notification. In some settings, members of the public, healthcare workers and others use mobile phones to notify a birth or death to the health system or to a central registration system.
