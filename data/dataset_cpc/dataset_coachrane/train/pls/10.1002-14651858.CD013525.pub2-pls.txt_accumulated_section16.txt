Pain management for medical abortion before 14 weeks' gestation
Key Messages 
• Ibuprofen has the best evidence for managing pain during medical abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, but the best dose is unclear.  
• Further studies are needed along with a robust, consistent way of recording pain.
 
What is medical abortion? 
There are two main types of abortion ‐ surgical or medical. Surgical abortion is carried out by specialist doctors in a clinic. In medical abortion, women take medicine ('abortion pills' consisting of mifepristone and misoprostol) to end their pregnancy. Medical abortion is increasingly common worldwide, but it is known to cause cramping and lower abdominal pain. In the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, medical abortion can take place in a clinic or at home, so it’s important that women have ways of treating themselves for pain.  
 
What did we want to find out? 
It is unclear what the best method of treating this pain is. We were interested in what the evidence was for pain relief medicines, such as ibuprofen or opiates, and other non‐medicinal methods like hot water bottles or mindfulness. 
 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that compared different pain relief treatments for medical abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. 
 
What did we find? 
We found five different studies, all of them looking at different kinds of treatment. Two studies were conducted in Israel, one of which compared ibuprofen with placebo, and another compared ibuprofen with paracetamol. Two studies were conducted in the USA, one compared ibuprofen given in response to pain or preventatively, and another compared pregabalin with placebo. The final study was conducted in the UK and compared being mobile during treatment with resting.
