Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth for women with a single baby (not multiple birth) 
There is not enough evidence to show the effects of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery rather than a policy of planned vaginal delivery for the birth of premature babies. 
Caesarean section is an operation performed to deliver a baby through a cut in the abdomen and womb. Planned caesarean delivery for women thought to be in preterm labour may be protective for the baby, also preventing an intrapartum emergency surgery with its associated complications, but could also be traumatic for both the mother and her baby. More often than not, women thought to be in preterm labour deliver weeks later, often at term. There is, therefore, a real possibility that a policy of planned caesarean section may increase the number of babies born preterm. 
We included six randomised studies (involving 122 pregnant women) but only four studies (involving 116 women) contributed to the analyses. Our review found that there is not enough reliable evidence to compare planned caesarean delivery with planned vaginal delivery. Sometimes a planned caesarean cannot happen because labour progresses too quickly and sometimes, even though vaginal delivery is planned, complications arising during labour may make a caesarean section necessary. The review found that not enough women have been recruited into trials and, therefore, the decision how best to deliver a preterm baby, either cephalic or breech presentation, remains opinion and current practice within a hospital, rather than being evidence‚Äêbased.
