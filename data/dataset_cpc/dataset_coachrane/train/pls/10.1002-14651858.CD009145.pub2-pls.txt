Bezafibrate for primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver that is characterised by progressive inflammation and destruction of the liver tissue, eventually progressing to liver cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation. Primary biliary cirrhosis primarily affects middle‐aged women. Bezafibrate is a hypolipidaemic agent used in treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. There are studies suggesting that bezafibrate, alone or in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, is effective in treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mechanisms through which bezafibrate improves lipid serum concentration balance and prevents biliary cell damage still need to be fully understood. This review evaluates all data on the benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in randomised clinical trials. The findings of this review are based on six randomised clinical trials with 151 Japanese patients. Bezafibrate was compared with no intervention in four trials (with co‐intervention of ursodeoxycholic acid in both the bezafibrate and control groups) and with ursodeoxycholic acid in two trials. The primary findings of the review are that bezafibrate has no statistically significant effects on mortality, liver‐related morbidity, adverse events, and quality of life of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. A possible positive intervention effect of bezafibrate versus no intervention on liver biochemistry measures can be real but could also be due to systematic errors or random errors. The benefits and harms of bezafibrate for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis need further assessment in randomised clinical trials comparing bezafibrate with placebo. Such trials ought to be conducted with impeccable methodology to reduce the risks of random errors and sufficiently large patient groups to reduce the risks of random errors.
