Risk‐scoring systems for the prevention of preterm birth
Identification of women whose pregnancies are at higher than average risk of preterm birth would allow the possibility of providing the women with higher level antenatal care with the aim of preventing the preterm birth. Preterm birth (before 37 completed weeks' gestation) is a major public health problem worldwide, and occurs in 6% to 10% of births in high‐income countries. The proportion of pregnancies which end prematurely, between 20 and 36 weeks, has not fallen in recent years. Perinatal interventions, both before birth (transfer of women to tertiary care, antenatal steroids), and after birth (intensive care, surfactant) have markedly improved perinatal outcomes. A number of scoring systems of risk factors associated with preterm birth have been used. Systematic, objective measures can include age, marital status, socio‐economic factors, smoking, threatened miscarriage, previous low birthweight baby, previous stillbirth, maternal weight and height. Their ability to identify women at increased risk of preterm birth, and subsequently to prevent preterm birth, has not been evaluated by randomised controlled trials. The literature search for this review revealed no trials of the use of risk‐scoring systems to prevent preterm birth. There are a number of ethical issues involved in the decision to implement risk scoring that have not been evaluated; for example, an intervention with potential morbidity and may be used, or used more frequently with no evidence of more favourable outcomes, or the woman may prefer not to disclose some sensitive information included in the measures. There is a need for prospective studies that evaluate the use of risk‐scoring systems to prevent preterm birth, including an assessment of their impact on women's well‐being. If these prove promising, they should be followed by an adequately powered, well‐designed randomised controlled trial.
