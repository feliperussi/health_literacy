The use of anti‐inflammatory corticosteroids for treating acute worsening in people with multiple sclerosis 
This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in The Cochrane Library 2000, Issue 4. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system. Focal inflammation impairs the ability of white matter tracts to conduct electrical impulses and produces acute episodes of neurological dysfunction called relapses. During a relapse of the disease, the symptoms may cause different levels of impairment with variable recovery. Relapse‐related sequelae may accumulate during the course of the disease and cause permanent disability. Disability is commonly evaluated according to the Kurtzke scale, which is scored over a range of 10 points (0 = no disability, 10 = death). 
Corticosteroids reduce the inflammation in the brain and the spinal cord and are the first drugs of choice to treat exacerbations of MS. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) versus no treatment (placebo) in decreasing disability in MS patients affected by acute relapse. Prevention of long‐term morbidity was also evaluated. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of different types of drugs and different schedules of treatment. 
Six studies published between 1961 and 1998 have been included, with a total of 377 participants. 
The main results of this review show that corticosteroids (methylprednisolone (MP)) or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation, increasing by more than 60% the probability of ameliorating the episode within the first five weeks of treatment. Clinical recovery was found to be accelerated and reduction of disability was assessed as a 1.5‐point change in EDSS score during the first week of therapy. The quality of evidence was moderate. The drugs were well tolerated.
