Improving the implementation of school‐based policies and practices to improve student health 
Key messages 
• Schools and their staff implement interventions to address student healthy eating, physical activity, obesity, and tobacco or alcohol use better when strategies are used to support them to do so.• School‐based interventions whose implementation is supported may be slightly more effective in improving student healthy eating, physical activity, obesity or tobacco use.• Most studies do not report economic evaluation of strategies to support implementation of interventions in schools or assess any potential adverse effects. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective strategies were in supporting the implementation of school‐based interventions to address student diet, physical activity, unhealthy weight gain, and tobacco or alcohol use. We wanted to know if they were cost‐effective and if they had any adverse effects. Examples of strategies include methods of improving quality, education and training, feedback on how the school was doing, prompts and reminders, and educational resources (e.g. manuals). 
What did we do? 
We updated a previous search we had conducted for studies that compared the use of a strategy to support intervention implementation to those that had not, or that had compared two or more different implementation strategies. The studies had looked at strategies to support the implementation of interventions in schools that addressed student nutrition, physical activity, obesity, or tobacco or alcohol use. We compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
