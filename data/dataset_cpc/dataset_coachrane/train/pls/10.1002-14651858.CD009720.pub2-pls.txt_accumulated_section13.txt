Effects of oral stimulation for oral feeding in preterm infants
Review questions 
Do oral stimulation interventions that involve finger stimulation protocols in preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation: 
• reduce time taken to achieve exclusive oral feeding and time spent in hospital?
• result in exclusive oral feeding, exclusive breast feeding or any direct breast feeding? 
• increase sucking strength?
• increase rate of growth and improve development?
Background 
Many preterm infants have delayed establishment of oral (suck) feeding and are fed at first with feeding tubes or with intravenous (parenteral) nutrition. Development of oral feeding skills needs careful co‐ordination of sucking, swallowing and breathing. In preterm infants, the development of oral feeding can be challenging because of long hospitalisations, breathing difficulties and other medical conditions associated with preterm birth. Unpleasant procedures such as ventilation or frequent suctioning of secretions from the mouth or nose can negatively impact feeding skills. International guidelines for the transition from tube feeding to oral feeding vary widely. Healthcare providers use a range of interventions to improve sucking and feeding skills in preterm infants, and studies report faster transition time from tube feeds to oral feeds, reduced length of stay in hospital and improvement in infants' sucking skills. No Cochrane review has assessed the intervention involving finger stimulation of the mouth before and during feeds. 
Study characteristics 
This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that explored oral stimulation by finger stimulation only in preterm infants. Review authors identified studies to be included by searching electronic databases, clinical trials registers, peer‐reviewed journals and published conference proceedings. 
Key results 
We included 19 studies of poor quality with small numbers of participants. Study findings suggest that oral stimulation interventions can shorten the transition to oral feeding, reduce length of hospital stay and decrease time spent on parenteral nutrition. No studies looked at longer‐term outcomes of the interventions (i.e. beyond six months). Studies have reported no effect on breast feeding outcomes nor on weight gain.
