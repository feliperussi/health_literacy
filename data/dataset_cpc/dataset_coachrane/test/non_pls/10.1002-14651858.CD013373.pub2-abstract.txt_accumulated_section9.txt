Background
Health services have traditionally been developed to focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are person‐centred and so better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals. Globally, governments recommend consumer involvement in healthcare decision‐making at the systems level, as a strategy for promoting person‐centred health services. However, the effects of this 'working in partnership' approach to healthcare decision‐making are unclear. Working in partnership is defined here as collaborative relationships between at least one consumer and health provider, meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats, to equally contribute to and collaborate on health service‐related decision‐making in real time. In this review, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' refer to partnership participants, and 'health service user' and 'health service provider' refer to trial participants. 
This review of effects of partnership interventions was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) entitled Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person‐centred health services: a co‐produced qualitative evidence synthesis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership, as an intervention to promote person‐centred health services. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2000 to April 2019; PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global from 2016 to April 2019; and grey literature and online trial registries from 2000 until September 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs of ‘working in partnership’ interventions meeting these three criteria: both consumer and provider participants meet; they meet jointly and regularly in formal group formats; and they make actual decisions that relate to the person‐centredness of health service(s).
