We found 32 eligible trials. The trials evaluated 27 different ways of increasing response to electronic questionnaires. We found substantial heterogeneity among trial results in half of the strategies. The odds of response were increased by more than a half using non‐monetary incentives (1.72; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.72; heterogeneity P < 0.00001, I2 = 95%), shorter e‐questionnaires (1.73; 1.40 to 2.13; P = 0.08, I2 = 68%), including a statement that others had responded (1.52; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.70), and a more interesting topic (1.85; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.26). The odds of response increased by a third using a lottery with immediate notification of results (1.37; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.65), an offer of survey results (1.36; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.61), and using a white background (1.31; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.56). The odds of response were also increased with personalised e‐questionnaires (1.24; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.32; P = 0.07, I2 = 41%), using a simple header (1.23; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48), using textual representation of response categories (1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36), and giving a deadline (1.18; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.34). The odds of response tripled when a picture was included in an e‐mail (3.05; 95% CI 1.84 to 5.06; P = 0.27, I2 = 19%). The odds of response were reduced when "Survey" was mentioned in the e‐mail subject line (0.81; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; P = 0.33, I2 = 0%), and when the e‐mail included a male signature (0.55; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.80; P = 0.96, I2 = 0%).
