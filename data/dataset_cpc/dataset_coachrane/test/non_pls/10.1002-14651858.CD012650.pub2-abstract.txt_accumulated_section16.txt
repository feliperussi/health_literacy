Background
Clinicians primarily recommend weight loss for obese women seeking pregnancy. The effectiveness of interventions aimed at weight loss in obese women with subfertility is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological strategies compared with each other, placebo, or no treatment for achieving weight loss in obese women with subfertility. 
Search methods
We searched the CGF Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and AMED from inception to 18 August 2020. We also checked reference lists and contacted experts in the field for additional relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials in which weight loss was the main goal of the intervention. Our primary effectiveness outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and primary safety outcomes were miscarriage and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, weight change, quality of life, and mental health outcome. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors followed standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
This review includes 10 trials. Evidence was of very low to low quality: the main limitations were due to lack of studies and poor reporting of study methods. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were lack of details by which to judge risk of bias (randomisation and allocation concealment), lack of blinding, and imprecision. 
Non‐pharmacological intervention versus no intervention or placebo  
Evidence is insufficient to determine whether a diet or lifestyle intervention compared to no intervention affects live birth (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.11; 918 women, 3 studies; I² = 78%; low‐quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no intervention is assumed to be 43%, the chance following diet or lifestyle changes would be 33% to 46%. We are uncertain if lifestyle change compared with no intervention affects miscarriage rate (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.39; 917 women, 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Evidence is insufficient to determine whether lifestyle change compared with no intervention affects clinical pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.40; 917 women, 3 studies; I² = 73%; low‐quality evidence). Lifestyle intervention resulted in a decrease in body mass index (BMI), but data were not pooled due to heterogeneity in effect (mean difference (MD) ‐3.70, 95% CI ‐4.10 to ‐3.30; 305 women, 1 study; low‐quality evidence; and MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐0.93; 43 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). 
Non‐pharmacological versus non‐pharmacological intervention  
We are uncertain whether intensive weight loss interventions compared to standard care nutrition counselling affects live birth (OR 11.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 284; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), clinical pregnancy (OR 11.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 284; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), BMI (MD ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐5.37 to ‐0.63; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), weight change (MD ‐9.00, 95% CI ‐15.50 to ‐2.50; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), quality of life (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.15; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or mental health (MD ‐7.00, 95% CI ‐13.92 to ‐0.08; 11 women, 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). No study reported on adverse events .
