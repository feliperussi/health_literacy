Background
Incontinence‐associated dermatitis (IAD) is one of the most common skin problems in adults who are incontinent for urine, stool, or both. In practice, products and procedures are the same for both prevention and treatment of IAD. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of various products and procedures to prevent and treat incontinence‐associated dermatitis in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 28 September 2016). Additionally we searched other electronic databases: CENTRAL(2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1946 to May Week 3 2015), MEDLINE In‐Process (inception to 26 May 2015), CINAHL(December 1981 to 28 May 2015), Web of Science (WoS; inception to 28 May 2015) and handsearched conference proceedings (to June 2015) and the reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors and experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, performed in any healthcare setting, with included participants over 18 years of age, with or without IAD. We included trials comparing the (cost) effectiveness of topical skin care products such as skin cleansers, moisturisers, and skin protectants of different compositions and skin care procedures aiming to prevent and treat IAD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. 
Main results
We included 13 trials with 1316 participants in a qualitative synthesis. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised. 
Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow‐up periods. .The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The data were not suitable for meta‐analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products, skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools.
