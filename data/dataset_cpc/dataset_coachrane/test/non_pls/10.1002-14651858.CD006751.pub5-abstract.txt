Background
People with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of a deficiency in fat‐soluble vitamins, including vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency predominantly causes eye and skin problems, while excessive levels of vitamin A can harm the respiratory and skeletal systems in children and interfere with the metabolism of other fat‐soluble vitamins. Most CF centres administer vitamin A as supplements to reduce the frequency of vitamin A deficiency in people with CF and to improve clinical outcomes such as growth, although the recommended dose varies between different guidelines. Thus, a systematic review on vitamin A and vitamin A‐like supplementation (carotenes or other retinoids) in people with CF would help guide clinical practice. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To determine if supplementation with vitamin A, carotenes or other retinoid supplements in children and adults with CF reduces the frequency of vitamin A deficiency disorders, improves general and respiratory health and affects the frequency of vitamin A toxicity. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additionally we searched several ongoing trials registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry. 
Most recent database searches: 01 June 2018.
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing all preparations of oral vitamin A, carotenes or retinoids (or in combination), used as a supplement compared to placebo at any dose, for at least three months, in people with CF (diagnosed by sweat tests or genetic testing) with and without pancreatic insufficiency. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors individually assessed study quality and extracted data on outcome measures. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Investigators were contacted to retrieve missing quantitative data. 
Main results
No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (β)‐carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive β‐carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the low‐dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a wash‐out period after the high‐dose supplementation. 
The included study did not report on two of the review's primary outcomes (vitamin A deficiency disorders and mortality); results for our third primary outcome of growth and nutritional status (reported as z score for height) showed no difference between supplementation and placebo, mean difference (MD) ‐0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.89 to 0.43) (low‐quality evidence). With regards to secondary outcomes, supplementation with high‐dose β‐carotene for three months led to significantly fewer days of systemic antibiotics required to treat pulmonary exacerbations, compared to controls, MD ‐15 days (95% CI ‐27.60 to ‐2.40); however, this was not maintained in the second three‐month section of the study when the level of β‐carotene supplementation was reduced, MD ‐8 days (95% CI ‐18.80 to 2.80) (low‐quality evidence). There were no statistically significant effects between groups in lung function (low‐quality evidence) and no adverse events were observed (low‐quality evidence). Supplementation affected levels of β‐carotene in plasma, but not vitamin A levels. The study did not report on quality of life or toxicity. 
Authors' conclusions
Since no randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies on retinoid supplementation were identified, no conclusion on the supplementation of vitamin A in people with CF can be drawn. Additionally, due to methodological limitations in the included study, also reflected in the low‐quality evidence judged following the specific evidence grading system (GRADE), no clear conclusions on β‐carotene supplementation can be drawn. Until further data are available, country‐ or region‐specific guidelines regarding these practices should be followed.
