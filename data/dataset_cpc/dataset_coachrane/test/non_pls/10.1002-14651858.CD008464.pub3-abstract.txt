Background
The keratocystic odontogenic tumours (KCOTs) account for between about 2% and 11% of all jaw cysts and can occur at any age. They are more common in males than females with a male:female ratio of approximately 2:1. Although they are benign, KCOTs are locally very aggressive and have a tendency to recur after treatment. Reported recurrence rates range from 3% to 60%. The traditional method for the treatment of most KCOTs is surgical enucleation. However, due to the lining of the cyst being delicate and the fact that they frequently recur, this method alone is not sufficient. Adjunctive surgical treatment has been proposed in addition to the surgical enucleation, such as removal of the peripheral bone (ostectomy) or resection of the cyst with surrounding bone (en‐bloc) resection. Other adjunctive treatments proposed are: cryotherapy (freezing) with liquid nitrogen and the use of the fixative Carnoy's solution placed in the cyst cavity after enucleation; both of which attempt to address residual tissue to prevent recurrence. 
Objectives
To assess the available evidence comparing the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of KCOTs. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 17 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 17 March 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 17 March 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing one modality of intervention with another with or without adjunctive treatment for the treatment of KCOTs. Adults, over the age of 18 with a validated diagnosis of solitary KCOTs arising in the jaw bones of the maxilla or mandible. Patients with known Gorlin syndrome were to be excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors screened trials for inclusion. Full papers were obtained for relevant and potentially relevant trials. If data had been extracted, it would have been synthesised using the fixed‐effect model, if substantial clinical diversity were identified between studies we planned to use the random‐effects model with studies grouped by action provided there were four or more studies included in the meta‐analysis, and we would have explored the heterogeneity between the included studies. 
Main results
No randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria were identified.
Authors' conclusions
There are no published randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question, therefore no conclusions could be reached about the effectiveness or otherwise of the interventions considered in this review. There is a need for well designed and conducted randomised controlled trials to evaluate treatments for KCOTs.
