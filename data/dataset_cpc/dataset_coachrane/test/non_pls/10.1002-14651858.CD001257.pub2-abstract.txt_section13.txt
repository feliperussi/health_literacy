Eight studies are now included in this review. When any dose omega‐3 (E‐EPA or EPA) is compared with placebo, small short trials suggest that the need for neuroleptics appears to be reduced for people allocated omega‐3 supplementation (n=30, 1 RCT, RR 0.73 CI 0.54 to 1.00) and mental state may improve (n=30, 1 RCT, RR not gaining 25% change in PANSS scores 0.54 CI 0.30 to 0.96, NNT 3 CI 2 to 29). There are no differences in the number of people leaving the study early (n=595, 6 RCTs, RR 0.86 CI 0.50 to 1.48). There are few data on the comparison of any dose omega‐6 (GLA) with placebo. For movement disorder outcomes, the one small study we found does not show any difference for average short‐term endpoint AIMS score (n=16, 1 RCT, WMD 1.30 CI ‐1.96 to 4.56). When any dose omega‐3 (E‐EPA or EPA) is compared with any dose omega‐3 (DHA) there is no significant difference for mental state outcome of not gaining 25% change in PANSS scores (n=31, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.39 to 1.11). When different doses of omega‐3 (E‐EPA) are compared with placebo there are no differences in measures of global and mental state between the studies. For the outcome of 'experiencing at least one adverse effect' no differences between groups are found for any dose (1 g/day E‐EPA vs placebo n=63, 1 RCT, RR 0.97 CI 0.60 to 1.56; 2 g/day E‐EPA vs placebo n=63, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.37 to 1.20; 4 g/day E‐EPA vs placebo n=58, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.72 to 1.82).
