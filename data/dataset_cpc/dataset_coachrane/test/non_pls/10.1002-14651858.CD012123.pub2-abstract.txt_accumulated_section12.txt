Background
Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease. Acute liver failure may be paracetamol‐induced or non‐paracetamol‐induced. Acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N‐acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing to undergo liver transplantation. Recent randomised clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N‐acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when given during early encephalopathy stages for patients with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (1990 to 25 June 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials that compared N‐acetylcysteine at any dose or route with placebo or no intervention in participants with non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity by calculating I2. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and determined the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included two randomised clinical trials: one with 183 adults and one with 174 children (birth through age 17 years). We classified both trials at overall high risk of bias. One unregistered study in adults is awaiting classification while we are awaiting responses from study authors for details on trial methodology (e.g. randomisation processes).
