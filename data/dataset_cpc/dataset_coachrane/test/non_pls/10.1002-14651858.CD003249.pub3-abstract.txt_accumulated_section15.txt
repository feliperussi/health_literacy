Background
Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the top five causes of maternal mortality in both developed and developing countries. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of any intervention used for the treatment of primary PPH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any interventions for the treatment of primary PPH. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies for eligibility and quality and extracted data independently. We contacted authors of the included studies to request more information. 
Main results
Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. 
Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics. Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41).   
Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not. Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering. 
Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre‐specified outcomes.
