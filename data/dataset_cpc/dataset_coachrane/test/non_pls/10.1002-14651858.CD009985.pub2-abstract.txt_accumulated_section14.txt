Background
Medication errors are preventable events that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional or patient. Medication errors in hospitalised adults may cause harm, additional costs, and even death. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of interventions to reduce medication errors in adults in hospital settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two trials registers on 16 January 2020.  
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies investigating interventions aimed at reducing medication errors in hospitalised adults, compared with usual care or other interventions. Outcome measures included adverse drug events (ADEs), potential ADEs, preventable ADEs, medication errors, mortality, morbidity, length of stay, quality of life and identified/solved discrepancies. We included any hospital setting, such as inpatient care units, outpatient care settings, and accident and emergency departments. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. Where necessary, we extracted and reanalysed ITS study data using piecewise linear regression, corrected for autocorrelation and seasonality, where possible.  
Main results
We included 65 studies: 51 RCTs and 14 ITS studies, involving 110,875 participants. About half of trials gave rise to 'some concerns' for risk of bias during the randomisation process and one‐third lacked blinding of outcome assessment. Most ITS studies presented low risk of bias. Most studies came from high‐income countries or high‐resource settings. Medication reconciliation –the process of comparing a patient's medication orders to the medications that the patient has been taking– was the most common type of intervention studied. Electronic prescribing systems, barcoding for correct administering of medications, organisational changes, feedback on medication errors, education of professionals and improved medication dispensing systems were other interventions studied. 
Medication reconciliation 
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that medication reconciliation (MR) versus no‐MR may reduce medication errors (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.74; 3 studies; n=379). Compared to no‐MR, MR probably reduces ADEs (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.80; 3 studies, n=1336 ; moderate‐certainty evidence), but has little to no effect on length of stay (mean difference (MD) ‐0.30 days, 95%CI ‐1.93 to 1.33 days; 3 studies, n=527) and quality of life (MD ‐1.51, 95%CI ‐10.04 to 7.02; 1 study, n=131).
