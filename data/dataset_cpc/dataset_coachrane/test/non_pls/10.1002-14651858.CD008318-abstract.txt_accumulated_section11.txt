Background
Patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are treated by three different techniques of cholecystectomy: open, small‐incision, or laparoscopic. There is no overview on Cochrane systematic reviews on these three interventions. 
Objectives
To summarise Cochrane reviews that assess the effects of different techniques of cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. 
Methods
The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) was searched for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the treatment of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (Issue 4, 2009). 
Main results
Three systematic reviews that included a total of 56 randomised trials with 5246 patients are included in this overview of reviews. All three reviews used identical inclusion criteria for trials and participants, and identical methodological assessments. 
Laparoscopic versus small‐incision cholecystectomy  Thirteen trials with 2337 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was relatively low. There was no significant difference regarding mortality or complications. Total complications of laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy were high, ie, 17.0% and 17.5%. Total complications (risk difference, random‐effects model ‐0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.07 to 0.05)), hospital stay (mean difference (MD), random‐effects ‐0.72 days (95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.04)), and convalescence were not significantly different. Trials with low risk of bias showed a quicker operative time for small‐incision cholecystectomy (MD, low risk of bias considering 'blinding', random‐effects model 16.4 minutes (95% CI 8.9 to 23.8)) while trials with high risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference. 
Laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy  Thirty‐eight trials with 2338 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐3 days (95% CI ‐3.9 to ‐2.3)) and convalescence (MD, random‐effects model ‐22.5 days (95% CI ‐36.9 to ‐8.1)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding mortality, complications, and operative time. 
Small‐incision versus open cholecystectomy  Seven trials with 571 patients randomised studied this comparison. Bias risk was high. Small‐incision cholecystectomy had a shorter hospital stay (MD, random‐effects model ‐2.8 days (95% CI ‐4.9 to ‐0.6)) compared with open cholecystectomy but did not differ significantly regarding complications and operative time.
