Eight randomised controlled trials with 856 patients were included. Three studies used a mixed intervention (including either aerobic exercises or breathing exercises); five studies used inspiratory muscle training. Only one study used sham training in the controls. Patients that received preoperative physical therapy had a reduced risk of postoperative atelectasis (four studies including 379 participants, relative risk (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; P = 0.01) and pneumonia (five studies including 448 participants, RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83; P = 0.01) but not of pneumothorax (one study with 45 participants, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.01 to 2.11; P = 0.15) or mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours after surgery (two studies with 306 participants, RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.03 to 9.20; P = 0.68). Postoperative death from all causes did not differ between groups (three studies with 552 participants, RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.02 to 18.48; P = 0.81). Adverse events were not detected in the three studies that reported on them. The length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in experimental patients versus controls (three studies with 347 participants, mean difference ‐3.21 days; 95% CI ‐5.73 to ‐0.69; P = 0.01). One study reported an increased physical function measure on the six‐minute walking test in experimental patients compared to controls. One other study reported a better health‐related quality of life in experimental patients compared to controls. Postoperative death from respiratory causes did not differ between groups (one study with 276 participants, RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.01 to 2.70; P = 0.19). Cost data were not reported on.
