Background
When women require induction of labour, oxytocin is the most common agent used, delivered by an intravenous infusion titrated to uterine contraction strength and frequency. There is debate over the optimum dose regimen and how it impacts on maternal and fetal outcomes, particularly induction to birth interval, mode of birth, and rates of hyperstimulation. Current induction of labour regimens include both high‐ and low‐dose regimens and are delivered by either continuous or pulsed infusions, with both linear and non‐linear incremental increases in oxytocin dose. Whilst low‐dose protocols bring on contractions safely, their potentially slow induction to birth interval may increase the chance of fetal infection and chorioamnionitis. Conversely, high‐dose protocols may cause undue uterine hyperstimulation and fetal distress. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of high‐ versus low‐dose oxytocin for induction of labour at term 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 August 2014) and the reference lists of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared oxytocin protocol for induction of labour for women at term, where high‐dose oxytocin is at least 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, with increments delivering at least 600 mU in the first two hours, compared with low‐dose oxytocin, defined as less than 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, and increments delivering less than 600 mU total in the first two hours. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We have included nine trials, involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. Trials were at a moderate to high risk of bias overall.
