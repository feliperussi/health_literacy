Background
Communication and language development are areas of particular weakness for young children with Down syndrome. Caregivers' interaction with children influences language development, so many early interventions involve training parents how best to respond to their children and provide appropriate language stimulation. Thus, these interventions are mediated through parents, who in turn are trained and coached in the implementation of interventions by clinicians. As the interventions involve a considerable commitment from clinicians and families, we undertook this review to synthesise the evidence of their effectiveness. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of parent‐mediated interventions for improving communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome. Other outcomes are parental behaviour and responsivity, parental stress and satisfaction, and children's non‐verbal means of communicating, socialisation and behaviour. 
Search methods
In January 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and 14 other databases. We also searched three trials registers, checked the reference lists of relevant reports identified by the electronic searches, searched the websites of professional organizations, and contacted their staff and other researchers working in the field to identify other relevant published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared parent‐mediated interventions designed to improve communication and language versus teaching/treatment as usual (TAU) or no treatment or delayed (wait‐listed) treatment, in children with Down syndrome aged between birth and six years. We included studies delivering the parent‐mediated intervention in conjunction with a clinician‐mediated intervention, as long as the intervention group was the only group to receive the former and both groups received the latter.
