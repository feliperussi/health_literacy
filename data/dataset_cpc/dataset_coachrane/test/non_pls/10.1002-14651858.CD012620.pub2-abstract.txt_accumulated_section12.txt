Background
Long‐acting bronchodilators such as long‐acting β‐agonist (LABA), long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations have been used in people with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to control symptoms such as dyspnoea and cough, and prevent exacerbations. A number of LABA/LAMA combinations are now available for clinical use in COPD. However, it is not clear which group of above mentioned inhalers is most effective or if any specific formulation works better than the others within the same group or class. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of available formulations from four different groups of inhalers (i.e. LABA/LAMA combination, LABA/ICS combination, LAMA and LABA) in people with moderate to severe COPD. The review will update previous systematic reviews on dual combination inhalers and long‐acting bronchodilators to answer the questions described above using the strength of a network meta‐analysis (NMA). 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, which contains several databases. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers’ websites. The most recent searches were conducted on 6 April 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people aged 35 years or older with a diagnosis of COPD and a baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of less than 80% of predicted. We included studies of at least 12 weeks' duration including at least two active comparators from one of the four inhaler groups. 
Data collection and analysis
We conducted NMAs using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We considered a study as high risk if recruited participants had at least one COPD exacerbation within the 12 months before study entry and as low risk otherwise. Primary outcomes were COPD exacerbations (moderate to severe and severe), and secondary outcomes included symptom and quality‐of‐life scores, safety outcomes, and lung function. We collected data only for active comparators and did not consider placebo was not considered. We assumed a class/group effect when a fixed‐class model fitted well. Otherwise we used a random‐class model to assess intraclass/group differences. We supplemented the NMAs with pairwise meta‐analyses. 
Main results
We included a total of 101,311 participants from 99 studies (26 studies with 32,265 participants in the high‐risk population and 73 studies with 69,046 participants in the low‐risk population) in our systematic review. The median duration of studies was 52 weeks in the high‐risk population and 26 weeks in the low‐risk population (range 12 to 156 for both populations). We considered the quality of included studies generally to be good.
