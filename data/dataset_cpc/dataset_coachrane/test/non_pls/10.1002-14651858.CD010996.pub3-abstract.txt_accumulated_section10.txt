Background
Guidelines and clinical practice for the prevention of complications associated with central venous catheters (CVC) around the world vary greatly. Most institutions recommend the use of heparin to prevent occlusion; there is debate, however, regarding the need for heparin and evidence to suggest normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) may be as effective. The use of heparin is not without risk, may be unnecessary and is also associated with increased cost. This is an update of the review published in 2015. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effects (benefits and harms) of intermittent flushing of normal saline versus heparin to prevent occlusion in long‐term central venous catheters in infants and children. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases; World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 9 April 2019. We also undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of intermittent flushing with normal saline versus heparin to prevent occlusion of long‐term CVCs in infants and children aged up to 18 years of age. We excluded temporary CVCs and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial inclusion criteria, trial quality and extracted data. We assessed study quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the rate ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled data using a random‐effects model; and we used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.
