Background
Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few hip OA treatments have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy which aims to treat disease by inserting very thin needles at specific points on the body. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture in patients with hip OA.
Search methods
We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase all through March 2018.
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, another active treatment, or no specific treatment; and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an addition to another treatment. Major outcomes were pain and function at the short term (i.e. < 3 months after randomization) and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Six RCTs with 413 participants were included. Four RCTs included only people with OA of the hip, and two included a mix of people with OA of the hip and knee. All RCTs included primarily older participants, with a mean age range from 61 to 67 years, and a mean duration of hip OA pain from two to eight years. Approximately two‐thirds of participants were women. Two RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture; the other four RCTs were not blinded. All results were evaluated at short term (i.e. four to nine weeks after randomization). 
In the two RCTs that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture, the sham acupuncture control interventions were judged believable, but each sham acupuncture intervention was also judged to have a risk of weak acupuncture‐specific effects, due to placement of non‐penetrating needles at the correct acupuncture points in one RCT, and the use of penetrating needles not inserted at the correct points in the other RCT. For these two sham‐controlled RCTs, the risk of bias was low for all outcomes. 
The combined analysis of two sham‐controlled RCTs gave moderate quality evidence of little or no effect in reduction in pain for acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture. Due to the small sample sizes in the studies, the confidence interval includes both the possibility of moderate benefit and the possibility of no effect of acupuncture (120 participants; Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) ‐0.13, (95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐0.49 to 0.22); 2.1 points greater improvement with acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture on 100 point scale (i.e., absolute percent change ‐2.1% (95% CI ‐7.9% to 3.6%)); relative percent change ‐4.1% (95% CI ‐15.6% to 7.0%)). Estimates of effect were similar for function (120 participants; SMD ‐0.15, (95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.21)). No pooled estimate, representative of the two sham‐controlled RCTs, could be calculated or reported for the quality of life outcome.
