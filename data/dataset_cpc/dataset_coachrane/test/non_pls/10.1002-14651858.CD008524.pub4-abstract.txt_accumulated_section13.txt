Background
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low‐ and middle‐income countries, affecting 190 million children under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death. Based on prior evidence and a previous version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children aged 6 to 59 months. The last version of this review was published in 2017, and this is an updated version of that review. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for preventing morbidity and mortality in children aged six months to five years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registers up to March 2021. We also checked reference lists and contacted relevant organisations and researchers to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six months to five years living in the community. We excluded studies involving children in hospital and children with disease or infection. We also excluded studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, consumption of vitamin A rich foods, or beta‐carotene supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
For this update, two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion resolving discrepancies by discussion. We performed meta‐analyses for outcomes, including all‐cause and cause‐specific mortality, disease, vision, and side effects. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
The updated search identified no new RCTs.
We identified 47 studies, involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies were set in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one‐third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about one year. The mean age of the children was about 33 months. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias.
