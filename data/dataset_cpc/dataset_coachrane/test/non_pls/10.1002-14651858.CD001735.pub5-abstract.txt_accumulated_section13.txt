Background
Pressure ulcers (i.e. bedsores, pressure sores, pressure injuries, decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue. They are common in the elderly and immobile, and costly in financial and human terms. Pressure‐relieving support surfaces (i.e. beds, mattresses, seat cushions etc) are used to help prevent ulcer development. 
Objectives
This systematic review seeks to establish: (1) the extent to which pressure‐relieving support surfaces reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers compared with standard support surfaces, and, (2) their comparative effectiveness in ulcer prevention. 
Search methods
In April 2015, for this fourth update we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 15 April 2015) which includes the results of regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 3). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials, published or unpublished, that assessed the effects of any support surface for prevention of pressure ulcers, in any patient group or setting which measured pressure ulcer incidence. Trials reporting only proxy outcomes (e.g. interface pressure) were excluded. Two review authors independently selected trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted by one review author and checked by another. Where appropriate, estimates from similar trials were pooled for meta‐analysis. 
Main results
For this fourth update six new trials were included, bringing the total of included trials to 59. 
Foam alternatives to standard hospital foam mattresses reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in people at risk (RR 0.40 95% CI 0.21 to 0.74). The relative merits of alternating‐ and constant low‐pressure devices are unclear. One high‐quality trial suggested that alternating‐pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating‐pressure overlays in a UK context.
