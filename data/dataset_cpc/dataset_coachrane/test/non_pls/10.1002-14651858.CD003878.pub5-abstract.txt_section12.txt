Forty‐five RCTs were identified and, from these, 26 trials including a total of 1217 participants and 2120 implants were included. Two trials were at low risk of bias, 12 were at high risk of bias and for the remaining 12 the risk of bias was unclear. In nine of the included studies there were no prosthetic failures within the first year, with no implant failures in seven studies and the mean rate of implant failure in all 26 trials was a low 2.5%. From 15 RCTs comparing immediate with conventional loading there was no evidence of a difference in either prosthesis failure (RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.67 to 5.34; 8 trials) or implant failure (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.60 to 3.77; 10 trials) in the first year, but there is some evidence of a small reduction in bone loss favouring immediate loading (MD ‐0.10 mm; 95% CI ‐0.20 to ‐0.01; P = 0.03; 9 trials), with some heterogeneity (Tau² = 0.01; Chi² = 14.37, df = 8 (P = 0.07); I² = 44%). However, this very small difference may not be clinically important. From three RCTs which compared early loading with conventional loading, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a clinically important difference in prosthesis failure, implant failure or bone loss. Six RCTs compared immediate and early loading and found insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a clinically important difference in prosthesis failure, implant failure or bone loss. From the two trials which compared occlusal loading with non‐occlusal loading there is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a clinically important difference in the outcomes of prosthesis failure, implant failure or bone loss. We did not identify any trials which evaluated progressive loading of implants.
