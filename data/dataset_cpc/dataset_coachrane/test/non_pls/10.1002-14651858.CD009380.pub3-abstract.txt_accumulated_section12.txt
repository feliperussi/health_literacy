Background
Glaucoma is one of the leading largely preventable causes of blindness in the world. It is usually  addressed first medically with topical intraocular pressure‐lowering drops or by laser trabeculoplasty. In cases where such treatment fails, glaucoma‐filtering surgery such as trabeculectomy, is commonly considered. Surgeons can differ in their technique when performing trabeculectomy, for example, the choice of the type of the conjunctival flap (fornix‐ or limbal‐based). In a fornix‐based flap, the surgical wound is performed at the corneal limbus; while in a limbal‐based flap, the incision is further away. Many studies in the literature compare fornix‐ and limbal‐based trabeculectomy with respect to outcomes and complications. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness of fornix‐ versus limbal‐based conjunctival flaps in trabeculectomy for adult glaucoma, with a specific focus on intraocular pressure (IOP) control and complication rates (adverse effects). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 23 March 2021. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing the benefits and complications of fornix‐ versus limbal‐based trabeculectomy for glaucoma, irrespective of glaucoma type, publication status, and language. We excluded studies on children less than 18 years of age, since wound healing is different in this age group and the rate of bleb scarring postoperatively is high. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as per Cochrane criteria. 
Main results
We did not identify any new eligible studies for this review update. As presented in the original review, we included six trials with a total of 361 participants. Two studies were conducted in the USA and one each in Germany, Greece, India, and Saudi Arabia. The participants of four trials had open‐angle glaucoma; one study included participants with primary open‐angle or primary closed‐angle glaucoma, and one study did not specify the type of glaucoma. Three studies used a combined procedure (phacotrabeculectomy). Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) was performed in four studies, and trabeculectomy with 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) was performed in only one study.
