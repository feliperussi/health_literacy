Background
Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that is characterised by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue and leakage of intracellular myocyte contents into circulating blood. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and is a potentially life‐threatening condition. Studies have indicated that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis by removing potentially damaging myoglobin and stabilising haemodynamic and metabolic status. 
Objectives
We aimed to: i) assess the efficacy of CRRT in removing myoglobin; ii) investigate the influence of CRRT on mortality and kidney‐related outcomes; and iii) evaluate the safety of CRRT for the treatment of people with rhabdomyolysis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 January 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure (from 1 January 1979 to 16 April 2013) and the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (to 16 April 2013). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that investigated clinical outcomes of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
Main results
Of the three included studies (101 participants), one evaluated continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis and two investigated continuous venovenous haemofiltration; all included conventional therapy as control. 
We found significant decreases in myoglobin in patients among whom CRRT therapy was initiated on days four, eight, and 10 (day 4: MD ‐11.00 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐20.65 to ‐1.35; Day 8: MD ‐23.00 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐30.92 to ‐15.08; day 10: MD ‐341.87 (μg/L), 95% CI ‐626.15 to ‐57.59) compared with those who underwent conventional therapy.
