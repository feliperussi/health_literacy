Background
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis. In particular, people with thalassaemia major develop secondary iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions. Iron chelation therapy is needed to prevent long‐term complications. 
Both deferoxamine and deferiprone are effective; however, a review of the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox in people with thalassaemia is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with thalassaemia and iron overload. 
Search methods
We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 12 August 2016. 
We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science Core Collection and three trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the Internet Portal of the German Clinical Trials Register: 06 and 07 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled studies comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron‐chelating treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
Sixteen studies involving 1807 randomised participants (range 23 to 586 participants) were included. Twelve two‐arm studies compared deferasirox to placebo (two studies) or deferoxamine (seven studies) or deferiprone (one study) or the combination of deferasirox and deferoxamine to deferoxamine alone (one study). One study compared the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Three three‐arm studies compared deferasirox to deferoxamine and deferiprone (two studies) or the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapy respectively (one study). One four‐arm study compared two different doses of deferasirox to matching placebo groups.
