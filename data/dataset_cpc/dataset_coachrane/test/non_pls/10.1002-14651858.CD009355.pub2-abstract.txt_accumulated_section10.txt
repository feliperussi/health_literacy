Background
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a variant of extranodal non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for about 2% to 5% of all primary intracranial tumours with immunocompetent patients. It appears at a median age of 62 years. A standard of care for PCNSL patients has not been defined yet, but high‐dose methotrexate (HD‐MTX) is considered to be a beneficial chemotherapy in PCNSL treatment. Currently, HD‐MTX is combined with numerous other chemotherapy drugs to improve outcomes of HD‐MTX monotherapy. However, the impact of additional chemotherapy remains unclear, as there is evidence of a higher risk of adverse events (AEs) such as infective complications. 
Objectives
We performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of additional chemotherapy to HD‐MTX in the treatment of immunocompetent PCNSL patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5) and MEDLINE (from 1950 to May 2012) as well as conference proceedings for RCTs. Two review authors (NB, NS) independently screened search results. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing HD‐MTX in combination with additional chemotherapy to mono‐chemotherapy with HD‐MTX in immunocompetent patients off all ages in first‐line treatment of PCNSL. 
Data collection and analysis
As an effect measure we used hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survivals (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). For effect measure of complete remission rate (CRR), partial response rate (PRR), treatment‐related mortality (TRM) and AEs we used risk ratios (RR). Two review authors (NB, NS) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials.
