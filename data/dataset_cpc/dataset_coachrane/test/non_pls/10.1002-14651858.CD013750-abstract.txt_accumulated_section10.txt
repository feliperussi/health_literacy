Background
In a previous Cochrane Review, we found that for women with metastatic breast cancer unselected for triple‐negative disease, there is little or no survival benefit and excess toxicity from platinum‐based regimens. In subgroup analyses, however, we found preliminary low‐quality evidence of a survival benefit from platinum‐based regimens for women with metastatic triple‐negative breast cancer (mTNBC). This review updates the evidence from the mTNBC subgroup analyses in the previous Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of platinum‐containing chemotherapy regimens with regimens not containing platinum in the management of women with mTNBC. 
Search methods
We obtained relevant studies published prior to 2015 and their extracted results from the mTNBC subgroup analysis in the previous Cochrane Review. We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov between 2015 and 27 September 2019. We identified further potentially relevant studies from previous trial reports, systematic reviews, and meta‐analyses. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing platinum‐containing chemotherapy regimens with regimens not containing platinum in women with mTNBC. Individual trials could compare one or more platinum‐based regimens to one or more non‐platinum regimens; hence there could be more 'treatment‐comparisons' (i.e. platinum regimen versus non‐platinum regimen comparison) than trials. Trial participants may have been purposely selected for mTNBC or inadvertently selected as a subgroup. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and extracted all relevant data from each study. We derived hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event outcomes, where possible, and used fixed‐effect models for meta‐analyses. We analysed objective tumour response rates (OTRRs) and toxicities as binary (dichotomous) outcomes with risk ratios (RRs) used as measures of effects. We extracted quality of life data, if available. We used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence for time‐to‐event and tumour response outcomes.
