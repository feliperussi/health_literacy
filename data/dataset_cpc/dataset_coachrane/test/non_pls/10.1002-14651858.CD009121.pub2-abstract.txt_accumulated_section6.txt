Background
Operations on structures in the chest (usually the lungs) involve cutting between the ribs (thoracotomy). Severe post‐thoracotomy pain can result from pleural (lung lining) and muscular damage, costovertebral joint (ribcage) disruption and intercostal nerve (nerves that run along the ribs) damage during surgery. Poor pain relief after surgery can impede recovery and increase the risks of developing complications such as lung collapse, chest infections and blood clots due to ineffective breathing and clearing of secretions. Effective management of acute pain following thoracotomy may prevent these complications and reduce the likelihood of developing chronic pain. A multi‐modal approach to analgesia is widely employed by thoracic anaesthetists using a combination of regional anaesthetic blockade and systemic analgesia, with both non‐opioid and opioid medications and local anaesthesia blockade. 
There is some evidence that blocking the nerves as they emerge from the spinal column (paravertebral block, PVB) may be associated with a lower risk of major complications in thoracic surgery but the majority of thoracic anaesthetists still prefer to use a thoracic epidural blockade (TEB) as analgesia for their patients undergoing thoracotomy. In order to bring about a change in practice, anaesthetists need a review that evaluates the risk of all major complications associated with thoracic epidural and paravertebral block in thoracotomy. 
Objectives
To compare the two regional techniques of TEB and PVB in adults undergoing elective thoracotomy with respect to: 
1. analgesic efficacy; 2. the incidence of major complications (including mortality); 3. the incidence of minor complications; 4. length of hospital stay; 5. cost effectiveness.
