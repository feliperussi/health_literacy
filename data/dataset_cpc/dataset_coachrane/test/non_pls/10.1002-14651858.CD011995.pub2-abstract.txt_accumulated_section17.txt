Background
This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve patient symptoms. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow‐up period of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means (douche, irrigation, drops, spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQL), patient‐reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event ‐ epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large‐volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2%) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six‐month period; the other compared 5 ml nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. 
Large‐volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care 
One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps.Disease‐specific HRQL  was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95% CI 9.63 to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow‐up and very low quality for the six months follow‐up. 
Patient‐reported disease severity  was evaluated using a "single‐item sinus symptom severity assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. 
No adverse effects  data were collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis.
