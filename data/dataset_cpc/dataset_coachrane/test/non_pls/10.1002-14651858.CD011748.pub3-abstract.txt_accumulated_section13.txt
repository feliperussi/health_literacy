Background
Despite the availability of effective drug therapies that reduce low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐cholesterol (LDL‐C), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, additional LDL‐C reduction may be warranted, especially for people who are unresponsive to, or unable to take, existing LDL‐C‐reducing therapies. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme, monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9 inhibitors) reduce LDL‐C and CVD risk. 
Objectives
Primary 
To quantify the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on CVD, all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Secondary 
To quantify the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, with specific focus on the incidence of influenza, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Search methods
We identified studies by systematically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in December 2019. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in August 2020 and screened the reference lists of included studies. This is an update of the review first published in 2017. 
Selection criteria
All parallel‐group and factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow‐up of at least 24 weeks and adult participants with or without a history of CVD were eligible if they compared PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab or evolocumab to placebo or active treatments such as statins, ezetimibe, or a combination of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Where data were available, we calculated pooled effect estimates. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence and in 'Summary of findings' tables.
