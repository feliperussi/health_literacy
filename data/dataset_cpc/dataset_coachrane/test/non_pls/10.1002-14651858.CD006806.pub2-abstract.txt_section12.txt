Five RCTs met the pre‐specified inclusion criteria for this review. No trials evaluated strict glycaemic control in the immediate pre‐operative period or outside the intensive care unit. Due to heterogeneity in patient populations, peri‐operative period, glycaemic target, route of insulin administration, and definitions of outcome measures, combination of the results of the five included trials into a meta‐analysis was not appropriate. The methodological quality of the trials was variable. In terms of outcomes, only one trial demonstrated a significant reduction in SSIs with strict glycaemic control, but the quality of this trial was difficult to assess as a result of poor reporting; furthermore the baseline rate of SSIs was high (30%). The other trials were either underpowered to detect a difference in SSIs, due to a low baseline rate (less than or equal to 5%), or did not report SSIs as a single outcome but as part of a composite. Of the three trials reporting hypoglycaemia (which was not consistently defined) all had a higher rate in the strict glycaemic control group but none attributed significant morbidity to the hypoglycaemia. Adequacy of glucose control between groups was measured differently among studies. Studies could not be compared due to differences in target ranges, and were susceptible to measurement bias due to differences in frequency of measurement and lack of blinding by the providers following the glycaemic protocols. Infection‐related mortality was not reported in any of the trials, and no trials demonstrated a significant difference in all‐cause mortality. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the strict glycaemic control groups in only one trial.
