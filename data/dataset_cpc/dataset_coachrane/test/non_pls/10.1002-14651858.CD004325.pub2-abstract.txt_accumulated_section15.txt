Background
Acute anterior dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and more susceptible to redislocation, especially in active young adults. 
Objectives
To compare surgical versus non‐surgical treatment for acute anterior dislocation of the shoulder. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (14 August 2009), The Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), trial registration databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results were pooled. 
Main results
The four included studies involved 163 participants, mainly active young adult males. All had had a primary (first time) traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Methodological quality was variable. 
All participants of one trial returned to active military duty. Two trials respectively reported similar numbers with reduced sports participation or non return to previous activities. The other, an inadequately reported, trial found significantly fewer people in the surgical group failed to attain previous levels of sports activity. 
Pooled results from all four trials showed that subsequent instability, either redislocation or subluxation, was statistically significantly less frequent in the surgical group (risk ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.44). This result remained statistically significant (risk ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.59) for the three trials reported in full. Half (17/33) of the conservatively treated patients with shoulder instability in these three trials opted for subsequent surgery. 
Different, mainly patient rated, functional assessment measures for the shoulder were recorded in these trials. The results were more favourable, usually statistically significantly so, in those treated surgically.
