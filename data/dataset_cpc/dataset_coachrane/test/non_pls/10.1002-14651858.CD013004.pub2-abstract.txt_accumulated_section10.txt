Background
Chronic heart failure is one of the most common medical conditions, affecting more than 23 million people worldwide. Despite established guideline‐based, multidrug pharmacotherapy, chronic heart failure is still the cause of frequent hospitalisation, and about 50% die within five years of diagnosis. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of ivabradine in individuals with chronic heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CPCI‐S Web of Science in March 2020. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We checked reference lists of included studies. We did not apply any time or language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in which adult participants diagnosed with chronic heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either ivabradine or placebo/usual care/no treatment. We distinguished between type of heart failure (heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction) as well as between duration of ivabradine treatment (short term (< 6 months) or long term (≥ 6 months)). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and checked data for accuracy. We calculated risk ratios (RR) using a random‐effects model. We completed a comprehensive ’Risk of bias’ assessment for all studies. We contacted authors for missing data. Our primary endpoints were: mortality from cardiovascular causes; quality of life; time to first hospitalisation for heart failure during follow‐up; and number of days spent in hospital due to heart failure during follow‐up. Our secondary endpoints were: rate of serious adverse events; exercise capacity; and economic costs (narrative report). We assessed the certainty of the evidence applying the GRADE methodology.
