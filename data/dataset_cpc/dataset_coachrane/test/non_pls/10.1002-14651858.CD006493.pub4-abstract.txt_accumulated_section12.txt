Background
The low uptake of HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) has hindered global attempts to prevent new HIV infections and has limited scale‐up of HIV care and treatment. Globally, only 10% of HIV‐infected individuals are aware of their HIV status. One approach to increase uptake is home‐based HIV VCT, which may be effective in increasing the number of patients on treatment and preventing new infections. 
Objectives
To establish the effect of home‐based HIV VCT on uptake of HIV testing
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (February 2007), EMBASE (February 2007), CENTRAL (February 2007), AIDSearch (February 2007), LILACS, CINAHL and Sociofile. We also contacted relevant researchers. The original review search strategy was updated in 2008. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing home‐based HIV VCT with other testing models
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We planned to conduct statistical analysis using the Review Manager software and calculate summary statistics (relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for primary outcomes. 
Main results
Only one study from developing countries met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. The study, a cluster randomised trial (10 clusters, n=849) compared VCT uptake between an optional location (including home‐based) and a local clinic location in a population‐based HIV survey. The study showed a higher uptake of VCT among participants in the optional‐location group. Uptake was significantly greater in the optional‐location group in those who were pre‐test counselled only (RR=4.6; 95% CI 3.58 to 5.91); pretest counselled and tested (RR=4.6; 95% CI 3.51 to 5.92); and post‐test counselled and received the test result (RR=4.8; 95% CI 3.62 to 6.21). This study, however, had significant methodological problems limiting further analysis and interpretation.
