Background
Tissue adhesives have been used for many years to close simple lacerations as an alternative to standard wound closure (sutures, staples, adhesive strips). Potential advantages over standard wound closure include ease of use, decrease in pain, time to apply and not requiring a follow‐up visit for removal. Whilst studies have compared tissue adhesives with standard wound closure to determine the cosmetic outcome and other secondary outcomes no systematic review was previously available, so that no generalizable, definitive answers about the effectiveness of tissue adhesives existed. 
Objectives
To summarize the best available evidence for the effects of tissue adhesives on the healing of traumatic lacerations in children and adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to October Week 1 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007 Week 41), CINAHL (1982 to October Week 2 2007), Web of Science ‐ Science Citation Index (1975 to April 29, 2007), seven clinical trial registries, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing tissue adhesives with standard wound closure or one tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive for acute, linear, low tension, traumatic lacerations in an emergency or primary care setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Information on adverse effects was collected from the trials. Outcomes of cosmesis (subgroups of age, wound location and need for deep sutures), pain, procedure time, ease of use, and complications were analysed separately for two comparisons: 1) tissue adhesive compared with standard wound closure; and 2) tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive.
