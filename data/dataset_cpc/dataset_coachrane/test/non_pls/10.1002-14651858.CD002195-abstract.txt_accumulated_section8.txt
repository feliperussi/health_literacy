Background
Between 10% and 35% of women with operable breast cancer will experience an isolated locoregional recurrence following their primary treatment. There is currently no good evidence that adjuvant systemic treatment is effective in this situation and there is no standard treatment for women who have such a recurrence. 
Objectives
To investigate whether additional systemic treatment will improve the result of local therapy in regard to relapse‐free and overall survival in women with potentially curatively resected locoregional recurrence following breast cancer and who have not had a previous or synchronous distant metastases. 
Search methods
The specialised register of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Collaborative Review Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE and records of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists´ Collaborative Group were searched for the initial review in 2001. A subsequent search of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register was conducted (19th May 2008). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials or trials in which women were allocated to active treatment or observation by a quasi‐randomised process (such as alternation or date of birth) were eligible. Our aim was to consider separately women with a first incidence of isolated loco‐regional recurrence in the treated breast, the chest wall or the regional lymphnode areas (except clavicular nodes) which can be resected without (R0) or with (R1) microscopically demonstrable residual disease. Women with previous or synchronous distant metastases were to be excluded from this part of the review. The second part of the review was to consider women with inoperable loco‐regional recurrence and/or clavicular lymphnode involvement, regardless of previous or synchronous metastases.
