Background
Care and support play a critical role in assisting people who are HIV‐positive to understand the need for prevention and to enable them to protect others. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic progresses and HIV‐seropositive individuals contend with devastating illness, it seemed timely to inquire if they receive support from family members. It also was important to develop a normative idea of how much family support exists and from whom it emanates. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of family support on morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and economics in families with at least one HIV‐infected member, in developing countries. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched:
The Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI), EMBASE, BIOSIS, SCISEARCH, the Cochrane HIV/AIDS group specialized register, INDMED, Proquest, and various South Asian abstracting databases, will be included in the database list. The publication sites of the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other international research and non‐governmental organizations.  An extensive search strategy string was developed in consultation with the trial search coordinator of the HIV/AIDS Review Group. Numerous relevant keywords were included in the string to get an exhaustive electronic literature search. The search was not restricted by language. Articles from other languages were translated into English with the help of experts. A hand search was carried out in many journals and abstracts of the conference proceedings of national and international conferences related to AIDS (e.g. the International Conference on HIV/AIDS and STI in Africa [ICASA]). Efforts also were made to contact experts to identify unpublished research and trials still underway.
