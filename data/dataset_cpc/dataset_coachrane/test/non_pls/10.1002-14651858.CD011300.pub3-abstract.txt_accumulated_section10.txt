Background
Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80% to 85% of all cases. For people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017 and it includes two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) among  people  with localised NSCLC of stages I to III who received curative intent of radiotherapy or surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases (from inception to 19 May 2021): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included trials. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs conducted in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with  NSCLC stage I to III after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC receiving radiotherapy with curative intent. We included participants who underwent primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy if the same strategy was provided for both intervention and control groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time‐to‐event data, using hazard ratios (HRs). We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we combined data by applying random‐effects models.
