In this updated review, we located one additional RCT, for a total of 11 included RCTs (5088 participants, 4046 of whom were available for meta‐analysis). There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.20; 10 RCTs; 2515 participants; high‐quality evidence); one‐year survival rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; I2 = 17%; 4004 participants; all 11 RCTs; high‐quality evidence); or response rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; I2 = 12%; all 11 RCTs; 4020 participants; high‐quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing carboplatin with different doses of cisplatin found an overall survival benefit in favour of carboplatin‐based regimens when compared to cisplatin at lower doses (40 to 80 mg/m2) (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28; 6 RCTs; 2508 participants), although there was no overall survival benefit when carboplatin‐based chemotherapy was compared to cisplatin at higher doses (80 to 100 mg/m2) (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; 1823 participants). Carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.04; I2 = 68%; 10 RCTs; 3670 participants) and was associated with more neurotoxicity (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; I2 = 0%, 5 RCTs; 1489 participants), although we believe this last finding is probably related to a confounding factor (higher dose of paclitaxel in the carboplatin‐containing treatment arm of a large study included in the analysis). There was no statistically significant difference in renal toxicity (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45; I2 = 3%; 3 RCTs; 1272 participants); alopecia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 300 participants); anaemia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.38; I2 = 77%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants); and neutropenia (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.63; I2 = 94%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants) between cisplatin‐based chemotherapy and carboplatin‐based chemotherapy regimens. Two RCTs performed a health‐related quality of life analysis; however, as they used different methods of measurement we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. One RCT reported comparative health‐related quality of life data between cisplatin and carboplatin‐containing arms but found no significant differences in global indices of quality of life, including global health status or functional scales.
