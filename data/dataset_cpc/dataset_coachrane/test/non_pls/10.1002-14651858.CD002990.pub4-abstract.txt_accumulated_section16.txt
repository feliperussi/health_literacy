Background
Self‐management interventions help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to acquire and practise the skills they need to carry out disease‐specific medical regimens, guide changes in health behaviour and provide emotional support to enable them to control their disease. Since the 2014 update of this review, several studies have been published. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
To evaluate the effectiveness of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and respiratory‐related hospital admissions.To evaluate the safety of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of respiratory‐related mortality and all‐cause mortality. 
Secondary objectives 
To evaluate the effectiveness of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of other health outcomes and healthcare utilisation.To evaluate effective characteristics of COPD self‐management interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, trials registries and the reference lists of included studies up until January 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised trials (CRTs) published since 1995. To be eligible for inclusion, self‐management interventions had to include at least two intervention components and include an iterative process between participant and healthcare provider(s) in which goals were formulated and feedback was given on self‐management actions by the participant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by reaching consensus or by involving a third review author. We contacted study authors to obtain additional information and missing outcome data where possible. Primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), number of respiratory‐related hospital admissions, respiratory‐related mortality, and all‐cause mortality. When appropriate, we pooled study results using random‐effects modelling meta‐analyses. 
Main results
We included 27 studies involving 6008 participants with COPD. The follow‐up time ranged from two‐and‐a‐half to 24 months and the content of the interventions was diverse. Participants' mean age ranged from 57 to 74 years, and the proportion of male participants ranged from 33% to 98%. The post‐bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of participants ranged from 33.6% to 57.0%. The FEV1/FVC ratio is a measure used to diagnose COPD and to determine the severity of the disease. Studies were conducted on four different continents (Europe (n = 15), North America (n = 8), Asia (n = 1), and Oceania (n = 4); with one study conducted in both Europe and Oceania). 
Self‐management interventions likely improve HRQoL, as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (lower score represents better HRQoL) with a mean difference (MD) from usual care of ‐2.86 points (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.87 to ‐0.85; 14 studies, 2778 participants; low‐quality evidence). The pooled MD of ‐2.86 did not reach the SGRQ minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of four points. Self‐management intervention participants were also at a slightly lower risk for at least one respiratory‐related hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98; 15 studies, 3263 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one respiratory‐related hospital admission over a mean of 9.75 months' follow‐up was 15 (95% CI 8 to 399) for participants with high baseline risk and 26 (95% CI 15 to 677) for participants with low baseline risk. No differences were observed in respiratory‐related mortality (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.04; 8 studies, 1572 participants ; low‐quality evidence) and all‐cause mortality (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01; 24 studies, 5719 participants; low‐quality evidence).
