Background
Acquired severe aplastic anemia is a rare and potentially fatal disease, which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia. The major signs and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaustion. First‐line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐matched sibling donor (MSD) is a treatment for newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia. First‐line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first‐line immunosuppressive therapy) is an alternative to MSD‐HSCT and is indicated for patients where no MSD is found. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of first‐line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA‐matched sibling donors compared to first‐line immunosuppressive therapy including ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin in patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia. 
Search methods
We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and The Cochrane Library CENTRAL (Wiley) for published articles from 1946 to 22 April 2013. Further searches included trial registries, reference lists of recent reviews, and author contacts. 
Selection criteria
The following prospective study designs were eligible for inclusion: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled trials if the allocation of patients to treatment groups was consistent with 'Mendelian randomization'. We included participants with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia who received MSD‐HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy without prior HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy, and with a minimum of five participants per treatment group. We did not apply limits on publication year or languages. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors abstracted the data on study and patient characteristics and assessed the risk of bias independently. We resolved differences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were treatment‐related mortality, graft failure, no response to first‐line immunosuppressive therapy, graft‐versus‐host‐disease (GVHD), relapse after initial successful treatment, secondary clonal and malignant disease, health‐related quality of life, and performance score.
