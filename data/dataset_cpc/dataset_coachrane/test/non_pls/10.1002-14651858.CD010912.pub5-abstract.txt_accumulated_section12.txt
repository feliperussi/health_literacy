Background
A large number of people are employed in sedentary occupations. Physical inactivity and excessive sitting at workplaces have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and all‐cause mortality. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to 9 August 2017. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over RCTs, cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs), and quasi‐RCTs of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before‐and‐after studies. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self‐reported or measured using devices such as an accelerometer‐inclinometer and duration and number of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more. We considered energy expenditure, total time spent sitting (including sitting at and outside work), time spent standing at work, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required. 
Main results
We found 34 studies — including two cross‐over RCTs, 17 RCTs, seven cluster‐RCTs, and eight controlled before‐and‐after studies — with a total of 3,397 participants, all from high‐income countries. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (16 studies), workplace policy changes (four studies), information and counselling (11 studies), and multi‐component interventions (four studies). One study included both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that specifically investigated the effects of standing meetings or walking meetings on sitting time.
