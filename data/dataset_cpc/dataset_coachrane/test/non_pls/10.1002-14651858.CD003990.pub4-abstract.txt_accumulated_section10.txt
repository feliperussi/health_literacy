Background
Adequate contraceptive advice is important in both women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 to reduce the risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in unplanned pregnancies. A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However, hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and increase micro‐ and macrovascular complications, so caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required. 
Objectives
To investigate whether progestogen‐only, combined estrogen and progestogen or non‐hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and in long‐term complications such as micro‐ and macrovascular disease when used in women with diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
The search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. The last search was performed in January 2013. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that studied women with diabetes mellitus comparing: 1. hormonal versus non‐hormonal contraceptives; 2. progestogen‐only versus estrogen and progestogen contraceptives; 3. contraceptives containing < 50 µg estrogen versus contraceptives containing ≥ 50 µg estrogen; and 4. contraceptives containing first‐, second‐ and third‐generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate.  The principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness, diabetes control, lipid metabolism and micro‐ and macrovascular complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts identified from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third review author. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta‐analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.
