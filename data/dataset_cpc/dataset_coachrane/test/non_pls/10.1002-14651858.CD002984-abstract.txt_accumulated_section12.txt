Background
Inhaled short acting beta2 adrenergic agonists and ipratropium bromide are both used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Objectives
In patients with acute exacerbations of COPD to: 1. To assess the efficacy of short‐acting beta‐2 agonists against placebo ; 2. Compare the efficacy of short‐acting beta‐2 agonists and ipratropium. 
Search methods
A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD trials register was carried out using the terms: bronchodilator* OR albuterol OR metaproterenol OR terbutaline OR isoetharine OR pirbuterol OR salbutamol OR beta‐2 agonist. 
Selection criteria
All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. 
Data collection and analysis
All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Trials were combined using Review Manager using a fixed effects model. The size of the treatment effects were tested for heterogeneity. 
Main results
We identified no placebo‐controlled comparisons of beta‐2 agonists. Three studies permitted comparison of ipratropium to an inhaled beta‐2 agonist. These studies included a total of 103 patients. The beta2‐agonists used were: fenoterol and metaproterenol. One study was a parallel group trial of regular therapy for seven days. The other two were cross over studies of single dose treatments, with efficacy measured 90 min post dose. There was no washout period between treatments.
