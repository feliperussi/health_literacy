Background
Current treatment modalities for cancer have been successful in achieving improved survivorship; however, they come with a number of long‐term adverse effects. Accidental falls are a common and clinically significant adverse event in people living with and beyond cancer and rates are higher than in the rest of the population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prescribed or provided exercise for reducing accidental falls, and falls risk factors of strength, flexibility and balance, in people living with and beyond cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases from inception to 10 July 2018, with no restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases. We searched clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing trials, and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials investigating exercise interventions versus no treatment, usual care or non‐exercise interventions on falls incidence or falls risk factors in adults living with and beyond cancer (18 years of age or older at diagnosis). We excluded cross‐over studies and studies in acute or inpatient hospice care. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently completed data extraction for included papers. We used Covidence software to manage screening, data collection and extraction. We assessed evidence using GRADE and presented results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
Eleven studies (835 participants) compared exercise to usual care. No studies compared exercise with no treatment or non‐exercise interventions. The quality of the evidence was very low for the primary outcome rates of falls, and very low to low for the secondary outcomes. We downgraded the evidence due to study limitations (risk of bias), and issues of imprecision due to small sample sizes, inconsistency and indirectness. All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to inability to blind participants to an exercise intervention. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear for other categories.
