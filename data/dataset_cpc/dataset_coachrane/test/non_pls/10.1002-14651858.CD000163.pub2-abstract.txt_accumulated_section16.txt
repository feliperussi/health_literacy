Background
Caesarean section is a very common surgical procedure worldwide. Suturing the peritoneal layers at caesarean section may or may not confer benefit, hence the need to evaluate whether this step should be omitted or routinely performed. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of non‐closure as an alternative to closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section on intraoperative and immediate‐ and long‐term postoperative outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 November 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing leaving the visceral or parietal peritoneum, or both, unsutured at caesarean section with a technique which involves suturing the peritoneum in women undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked it for accuracy. 
Main results
A total of 29 trials were included in this review and 21 trials (17,276 women) provided data that could be included in an analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. 
1. Non‐closure of visceral and parietal peritoneum versus closure of both parietal layers 
Sixteen trials involving 15,480 women, were included and analysed, when both parietal peritoneum was left unclosed versus when both peritoneal surfaces were closed. Postoperative adhesion formation was assessed in only four trials with 282 women, and no difference was found between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.29). There was significant reduction in the operative time (mean difference (MD) ‐5.81 minutes, 95% CI ‐7.68 to ‐3.93). The duration of hospital stay in a total of 13 trials involving 14,906 women, was also reduced (MD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.05) days. In a trial involving 112 women, reduced chronic pelvic pain was found in the peritoneal non‐closure group. 
2. Non‐closure of visceral peritoneum only versus closure of both peritoneal surfaces 
Three trials involving 889 women were analysed. There was an increase in adhesion formation (two trials involving 157 women, RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.16) which was limited to one trial with high risk of bias.There was reduction in operative time, postoperative days in hospital and wound infection. There was no significant reduction in postoperative pyrexia.
