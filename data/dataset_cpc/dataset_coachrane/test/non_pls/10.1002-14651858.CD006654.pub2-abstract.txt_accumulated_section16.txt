Background
In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ("atypical") antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of olanzapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. 
Search methods
1. Electronic searching  We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 
2. Reference searching  We inspected the reference of all identified studies for more trials. 
3. Personal contact  We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 
4. Drug companies  We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised trials that used at least single‐blind (rater‐blind) design, comparing oral olanzapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model. 
Main results
The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic. 
Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=794, WMD ‐4.96 CI ‐8.06 to ‐1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n=1449, WMD ‐3.66 CI ‐5.39 to ‐1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n=2390, WMD ‐1.94 CI ‐3.31 to ‐0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐8.32 CI ‐10.99 to ‐5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n=1563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n=2744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33).
