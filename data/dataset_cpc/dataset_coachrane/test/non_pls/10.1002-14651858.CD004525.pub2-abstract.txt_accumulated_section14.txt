Background
Etanercept is a soluble tumour necrosis factor alpha‐receptor disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Objectives
The purpose of this review was to update the previous Cochrane systematic review published in 2003 assessing the benefits and harms of etanercept for the treatment of RA. In addition, we also evaluated the benefits and harms of etanercept plus DMARD compared with DMARD monotherapy in those people with RA who are partial responders to methotrexate (MTX) or any other traditional DMARD. 
Search methods
Five electronic databases were searched from 1966 to February 2003 with no language restriction. The search was updated to January 2012. Attempts were made to identify other studies by contact with experts, searching reference lists and searching trial registers. 
Selection criteria
All controlled trials (minimum 24 weeks' duration) comparing four possible combinations: 1) etanercept (10 mg or 25 mg twice weekly) plus a traditional DMARD (either MTX or sulphasalazine) versus a DMARD, 2) etanercept plus DMARD versus etanercept alone, 3) etanercept alone versus a DMARD or 4) etanercept versus placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the trials. 
Main results
Three trials were included in the original version of the review. An additional six trials, giving a total of 2842 participants, were added to the 2012 update of the review. The trials were generally of moderate to low risk of bias, the majority funded by pharmaceutical companies. Follow‐up ranged from six months to 36 months. 
Benefit
At six to 36 months the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate was statistically significantly improved with etanercept plus DMARD treatment when compared with a DMARD in those people who had an inadequate response to any traditional DMARD (risk ratio (RR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.9, absolute treatment benefit (ATB) 38%; 95% CI 13% to 59%) and in those people who were partial responders to MTX (RR 11.7; 95% CI 1.7 to 82.5, ATB 36%). Similar results were observed when pooling data from all participants (responders or not) (ACR 50 response rates at 24 months: RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.8, ATB 29%; 36 months: RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9, ATB 24%). Statistically significant improvement in physical function and a higher proportion of disease remission were observed in combination‐treated participants compared with DMARDs alone ((mean difference (MD) ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.28 in a 0‐3 scale) and (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.31), respectively) in those people who had an inadequate response to any traditional DMARD. All changes in radiographic scores were statistically significantly less with combination treatment (etanercept plus DMARD) compared with MTX alone for all participants (responders or not) (Total Sharp Score (TSS) (scale = 0 to 448): MD ‐2.2, 95% CI ‐3.0 to ‐1.4; Erosion Score (ES) (scale = 0 to 280): MD ‐1.6; 95% CI ‐2.4 to ‐0.9; Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSNS) (scale = 0 to 168): MD ‐0.7; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.2), and with combination treatment compared with etanercept alone (TSS: MD ‐1.1; 95% CI ‐1.8 to ‐0.5; ES: MD ‐0.7; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.2; JSNS: MD ‐0.5, 95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2). The estimate of irreversible physical disability over 10 years given the radiographic findings was 0.45 out of 3.0.
