Background
Vitamin K deficiency can cause bleeding in an infant in the first weeks of life. This is known as Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). HDN is divided into three categories: early, classic and late HDN. Early HDN occurs within 24 hours post partum and falls outside the scope of this review. Classic HDN occurs on days one to seven; common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, nasal and from a circumcision. Late HDN occurs from week 2‐12; the most common bleeding sites are intracranial, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal. 
Vitamin K is commonly given prophylactically after birth for the prevention of HDN, but the preferred route is uncertain. 
Objectives
To review the evidence from randomized trials in order to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of classic and late HDN. Main questions are: Is one dose of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? Is there a significant difference between the oral route and the intramuscular route in preventing classic and late HDN? Are multiple oral doses of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? 
Search methods
The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used.
Selection criteria
All trials using random or quasi‐random patient allocation, in which methods of vitamin K prophylaxis in infants were compared to each other, placebo or no treatment, were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed with the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group, using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference.
