Background
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the most common, preventable complications of surgery. Although the relationship between surgery and DVT is well established in general surgical operations and most other subspecialties, the same cannot be said about arterial surgery. Deep vein thrombosis is believed to be less common in aortic surgery where its management is rather controversial with a reported incidence of DVT from 2% to 18%. 
Intra‐operative heparin is believed to provide protection during the period when DVT is most likely to develop. The practice of using intra‐operative heparin could increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications if further heparin is used during the recovery period. This can significantly limit the use of such prophylactic measures especially with the low perceived risk of venous thromboembolism (DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE)) following abdominal aortic surgery. However, vascular patients are usually older, with more co‐morbidity and are subject to prolonged immobility, all of which increase the likelihood of developing venous thromboembolism. This is an update of the Cocharane review published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of anticoagulant prophylaxis (with or without mechanical devices) in patients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their trials register (last searched 13 July 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, (last searched Issue 3, 2009). 
The authors searched for additional trials through reference lists of retrieved studies and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of anticoagulants (with or without mechanical devices) with control or no intervention in preventing DVT or PE after abdominal aortic operations.
