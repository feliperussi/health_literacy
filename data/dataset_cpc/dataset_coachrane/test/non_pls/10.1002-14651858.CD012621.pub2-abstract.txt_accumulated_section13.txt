Background
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a group of complex and heterogenous conditions, characterised by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and which left untreated leads to right‐heart failure and death. PH includes World Health Organisation (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Group 2 consists of PH due to left‐heart disease (PH‐LHD); Group 3 comprises PH as a result of lung diseases or hypoxia, or both; Group 4 includes PH due to chronic thromboembolic occlusion of pulmonary vasculature (CTEPH), and Group 5 consists of cases of PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms including haematological, systemic, or metabolic disorders. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase vasodilation and inhibit proliferation. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children. 
Search methods
We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 26 September 2018. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared any PDE5 inhibitor versus placebo, or any other PAH disease‐specific therapies, for at least 12 weeks. We include separate analyses for each PH group. 
Data collection and analysis
We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full‐text versions of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were: change in WHO functional class, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD), and mortality. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic parameters, quality of life/health status, dyspnoea, clinical worsening (hospitalisation/intervention), and adverse events. When appropriate, we performed meta‐analyses and subgroup analyses by severity of lung function, connective tissue disease diagnosis, and radiological pattern of fibrosis. We assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach and created 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. 
Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (odds ratio (OR) 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 40 to 56; 8 trials, 880 participants), and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high‐certainty evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one additional death was 32 participants. There was an increased risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, especially headache (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.92; 5 trials, 848 participants), gastrointestinal upset (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.48; 5 trials, 848 participants), flushing (OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.83 to 9.26; 3 trials, 748 participants), and muscle aches and joint pains (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.99; 4 trials, 792 participants).
