In the main comparison, women in the hypnosis group were less likely to use pharmacological pain relief or analgesia than those in the control groups, (average risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94, eight studies, 2916 women; very low‐quality evidence; random‐effects model). There were no clear differences between women in the hypnosis group and those in the control groups for most of the other primary outcomes. There were no clear differences for sense of coping with labour (MD 0.22, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.58, one study, 420 women; low‐quality evidence) or spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.32, six studies, 2361 women; low‐quality evidence; random‐effects model). There were no clear differences for satisfaction with pain relief (measured on a seven‐point scale two weeks postnatally) for women in the hypnosis group who also received pethidine (MD 0.41, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 1.27; one study, 72 women), Entonox (MD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.57; one study, 357 women), self‐hypnosis (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.88; one study, 160 women), or epidural (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 0.34; one study, 127 women), but a slight benefit in favour of hypnosis was seen for women who received water immersion (MD 0.52, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.00; one study, 174 women (all low‐quality evidence). There were no clear differences for satisfaction with pain relief when it was measured as the number of women who reported they had adequate pain relief (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20, one study, 264 women; low‐quality evidence). It should be noted that for pharmacological pain relief and spontaneous vaginal birth, there was evidence of considerable statistical heterogeneity, which could not be fully explained by subgroup analysis.
