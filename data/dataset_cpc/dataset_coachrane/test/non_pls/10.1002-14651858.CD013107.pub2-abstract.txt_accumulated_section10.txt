Background
Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Chronic hepatitis B requires long‐term management aiming to reduce the risks of hepatocellular inflammatory necrosis, liver fibrosis, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer, as well as to improve health‐related quality of life. Acupuncture is being used to decrease discomfort and improve immune function in people with chronic hepatitis B. However, the benefits and harms of acupuncture still need to be established in a rigorous way. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupuncture in people with chronic hepatitis B. 
Search methods
We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (CQVIP), Wanfang Data, and SinoMed to 1 March 2019. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/), and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) for ongoing or unpublished trials until 1 March 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of publication status, language, and blinding, comparing acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupuncture in people with chronic hepatitis B. We included participants of any sex and age, diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B as defined by the trialists or according to guidelines. We allowed co‐interventions when the co‐interventions were administered equally to all intervention groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors in pairs individually retrieved data from reports and through correspondence with investigators. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were hepatitis B‐related mortality, hepatitis B‐related morbidity, and adverse events considered not to be serious. We presented the pooled results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risks of bias using risk of bias domains with predefined definitions. We put more weight on the estimate closest to zero effect when results with fixed‐effect and random‐effects models differed. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
