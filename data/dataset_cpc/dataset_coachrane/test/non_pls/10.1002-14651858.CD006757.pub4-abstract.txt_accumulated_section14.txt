Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study.
