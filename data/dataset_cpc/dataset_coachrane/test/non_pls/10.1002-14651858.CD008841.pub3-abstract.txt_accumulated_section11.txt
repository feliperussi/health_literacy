Background
This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2015.
Around half of people with epilepsy will not achieve seizure freedom on their first antiepileptic drug; many will require add‐on therapy. Around a third of people fail to achieve complete seizure freedom despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. Lacosamide has been licenced as an add‐on therapy for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of lacosamide as an add‐on therapy for children and adults with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases (22 August 2019): the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), including the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 20 August 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), with no language restrictions. We contacted UCB Pharma (sponsors of lacosamide). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of add‐on lacosamide in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology, assessing the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; seizure freedom; treatment withdrawal; adverse events; quality of life; and cognitive changes. The primary analyses were intention‐to‐treat. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for each outcome presented with 99% confidence intervals (CI), except for 50% or greater seizure reduction, seizure freedom and treatment withdrawal which were presented with 95% CIs. We performed subgroup analyses according to lacosamide dose and sensitivity analyses according to population age, whereby data from children were excluded from the meta‐analysis.
