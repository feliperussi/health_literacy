Background
Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non‐conventional agents. 
Objectives
1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. 
2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents. 
3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non‐conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross‐over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double‐entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures.
