Background
Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for extensive stage small celI lung cancer (SCLC) over the last 30 years, even though it only gives a short prolongation in median survival time. The main goal for these patients should be palliation with the aim of improving their quality of life. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of first‐line chemotherapy versus placebo or best supportive care (BSC) in prolonging survival in patients with extensive SCLC at diagnosis and the effectiveness of second‐line chemotherapy at relapse or progression after first‐line chemotherapy compared with BSC or placebo in prolonging survival in patients with extensive SCLC; as well as to evaluate the adverse events of treatment and the quality of life of patients. 
Search methods
This is the second update of the review. MEDLINE (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1974 to October 2013), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 3) were searched. Experts in the field were contacted. 
Selection criteria
Phase III randomised controlled trials in which any chemotherapy treatment was compared with  placebo or BSC in patients with extensive SCLC, as first‐line or second‐line therapy at relapse. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Additional information was obtained from one study author. 
Main results
Two studies of unclear risk of bias were included for first‐line chemotherapy. A total of 88 men under 70 years with good performance status were randomised to receive either supportive care, placebo infusion or ifosfamide. Ifosfamide gave an extra mean survival of 78.5 days compared with supportive care or placebo infusion. Partial tumour response was greater with the active treatment. Toxicity was only seen in the chemotherapy group and quality of life was only assessed at the beginning of treatment. The quality of the evidence for overall survival and adverse effects was very low. 
Three studies of moderate risk of bias were included for second‐line chemotherapy at relapse (one identified in the last search). A total of 932 men and women under 75 years and any performance status were randomised to receive either methotrexate‐doxorubicin, topotecan, or picoplatin versus symptomatic treatment or BSC. The methotrexate‐doxorubicin treatment gave a median survival of 63 days longer than in the symptomatic‐treatment group for patients allocated to receive four cycles of first‐line chemotherapy, and 21 days longer for patients allocated to receive eight cycles of first‐line chemotherapy. 
Treatment with topotecan gave a median survival of 84 days longer than in the BSC group (log‐rank P = 0.01). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.87). Treatment with picoplatin gave a median survival time of six days longer than BSC (HR 0.817, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.0895). A meta‐analysis of topotecan and picoplatin gave a HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96, P = 0.03; low‐quality evidence). 
Partial or complete response in the methotrexate‐doxorubicin group was 22.3%. Five patients (7%, 95% CI 2.33 to 15.67) showed a partial response with topotecan. No data were provided about tumour response in the picoplatin study. Toxicity was worst in the chemotherapy group (moderate‐quality evidence). Quality of life was better in the topotecan group and was not measured in the methotrexate‐doxorubicin and picoplatin studies (low‐quality evidence).
