Background
Cord drainage in the third stage of labour involves unclamping the previously clamped and divided umbilical cord and allowing the blood from the placenta to drain freely into an appropriate receptacle. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the specific effects of placental cord drainage on the third stage of labour following vaginal birth, with or without prophylactic use of uterotonics in the management of the third stage of labour. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing placental cord draining with no placental cord drainage as part of the management of the third stage of labour. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. This was then verified by the third review author who then entered the agreed outcomes to the review. 
Main results
Three studies involving 1257 women met our inclusion criteria. Cord drainage reduced the length of the third stage of labour (mean difference (MD) ‐2.85 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.04 to ‐1.66; three trials, 1257 women (heterogeneity: T² = 0.87; Chi²P=17.19, I² = 88%)) and reduced the average amount of blood loss (MD ‐77.00 ml, 95% CI ‐113.73 to ‐40.27; one trial, 200 women). 
No incidence of retained placenta at 30 minutes after birth was observed in the included studies, therefore, it was not possible to compare this outcome. The differences between the cord drainage and the control group were not statistically significant for postpartum haemorrhage or manual removal of the placenta. None of the included studies reported fetomaternal transfusion outcomes and there were no data relating to maternal pain or discomfort during the third stage of labour.
