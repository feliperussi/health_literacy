Background
Intermittent urethral self‐dilatation is sometimes recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent urethral stricture. There is no consensus as to whether it is a clinically effective or cost‐effective intervention in the management of this disease. 
Objectives
The purpose of this review is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of intermittent self‐dilatation after urethral stricture surgery in males compared to no intervention. We also compared different programmes of, and devices for, intermittent self‐dilatation. . 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 7 May 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1 January 1946 to Week 3April 2014), PREMEDLINE (covering 29 April 2014), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to Week 17 2014), CINAHL (31 December 1981 to 30 April 2014) OpenGrey (searched 6 May 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (6 May 2014), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (6 May 2014), Current Controlled Trials (6 May 2014) and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials where one arm was a programme of intermittent self‐dilatation for urethral stricture were identified. Studies were excluded if they were not randomised or quasi‐randomised trials, or if they pertained to clean intermittent self‐catheterisation for bladder emptying. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors screened the records for relevance and methodological quality. Data extraction was performed according to predetermined criteria using data extraction forms. Analyses were carried out in Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan 5). The primary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and health‐related quality of life, and risk of recurrence; secondary outcomes were adverse events, acceptability of the intervention to patients and cost‐effectiveness. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Eleven trials were selected for inclusion in the review, including a total of 776 men. They were generally small; all were of poor quality and all were deemed to have high risk of bias. 
Performing intermittent self‐dilatationversus not performing intermittent self‐dilatation 
The data from six trials were heterogeneous, imprecise and had a high risk of bias, but indicated that recurrent urethral stricture was less likely in men who performed intermittent self‐dilatation than men who did not perform intermittent self‐dilatation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.00; very low quality evidence). Adverse events were generally poorly reported: two trials did not report adverse events and two trials reported adverse events only for the intervention group. Meta‐analysis of the remaining two trials found no evidence of a difference between performing intermittent self‐dilatation and not performing it (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.26). No trials formally assessed acceptability, and no trials reported on patient‐reported lower urinary tract symptoms, patient‐reported health‐related quality of life, or cost‐effectiveness. 
One programme of intermittent self‐dilatationversus another 
We identified two trials that compared different durations of intermittent self‐dilatation, but data were not combined. One study could not draw robust conclusions owing to cross‐over, protocol deviation, administrative error, post‐hoc analysis and incomplete outcome reporting. The other study found no evidence of a difference between intermittent self‐dilatation for six months versus for 12 months after optical urethrotomy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.64), although again the evidence is limited by the small sample size and risk of bias in the included study. Adverse events were reported narratively and were not stratified by group. No trials formally assessed acceptability, and no trials reported on patient‐reported lower urinary tract symptoms, patient‐reported health‐related quality of life, or cost‐effectiveness. 
One device for performing intermittent self‐dilatationversus another 
Three trials compared one device for performing intermittent self‐dilatation with another. Results from one trial at a high risk of bias were too uncertain to determine the effects of a low friction hydrophilic catheter and a standard polyvinyl chloride catheter on the risk of recurrent urethral stricture (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.40). Similarly one study did not find evidence of a difference between one percent triamcinolone gel for lubricating the intermittent self‐dilatation catheter versus water‐based gel on risk of recurrent urethral stricture (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.32). Two trials reported adverse events, but one did not provide sufficient detail for analysis. The other small study reported fewer instances of prostatitis, urethral bleeding or bacteriuria with a low friction hydrophilic catheter compared with a standard polyvinyl chloride catheter (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98). ‘Happiness with the intervention’ was assessed using a non‐validated scale in one study, but no trials formally assessed patient‐reported health‐related quality of life or acceptability. No trials reported on patient‐reported lower urinary tract symptoms or cost‐effectiveness. 
GRADE quality assessment 
The evidence that intermittent self‐dilatation reduces the risk of recurrent urethral stricture after surgical intervention was downgraded to 'very low' on the basis that the studies comprising the meta‐analysis were deemed to have high risk of bias, and the data was imprecise and inconsistent. 
Insufficient evidence 
No trials provided cost‐effectiveness data or used a validated patient‐reported outcome measure, and adverse events were not reported rigorously. Acceptability of the intervention to patients has not been assessed quantitatively or qualitatively. 
Authors' conclusions
Performing intermittent self‐dilatation may confer a reduced risk of recurrent urethral stricture after endoscopic treatment. We have very little confidence in the estimate of the effect owing to the very low quality of the evidence. Evidence for other comparisons and outcomes is limited. Further research is required to determine whether the apparent benefit is sufficient to make the intervention worthwhile, and in whom.
