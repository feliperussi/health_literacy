Background
Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a most serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Besides benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants are often used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Anticonvulsants drugs are indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, alone or in combination with benzodiazepine treatments. In spite of the wide use, the exact role of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal has not yet bee adequately assessed. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group' Register of Trials (December 2009), PubMed,  EMBASE,  CINAHL (1966 to December 2009), EconLIT (1969 to December 2009). Parallel searches on web sites of health technology assessment and related agencies, and their databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness, safety and overall risk‐benefit of anticonvulsants in comparison with a placebo or other pharmacological treatment. All patients were included regardless of age, gender, nationality, and outpatient or inpatient therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.
Main results
Fifty‐six studies, with a total of 4076 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Comparing anticonvulsants with placebo, no statistically significant differences for the six outcomes considered. 
Comparing anticonvulsant versus other drug, 19 outcomes considered, results favour anticonvulsants only in the comparison carbamazepine versus benzodiazepine (oxazepam and lorazepam) for  alcohol withdrawal symptoms (CIWA‐Ar score): 3 studies, 262 participants, MD ‐1.04 (‐1.89 to ‐0.20),  none of the other comparisons reached statistical significance.
