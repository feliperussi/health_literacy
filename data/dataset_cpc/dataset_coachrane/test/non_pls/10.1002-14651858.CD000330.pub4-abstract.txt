Background
Although the use of enemas during labour usually reflects the preference of the attending healthcare provider, enemas may cause discomfort for women. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of enemas applied during the first stage of labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2013), LILACS (31 May 2013), the Search Portal of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 May 2013), Health Technology Assessment Program, UK (31 May 2013), Medical Research Council, UK (31 May 2013), The Wellcome Trust, UK (31 May 2013) and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which an enema was administered during the first stage of labour and which included assessment of possible neonatal or puerperal morbidity or mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. 
Main results
Four RCTs (1917 women) met the inclusion criteria. One study was judged as having a low risk of bias. In the meta‐analysis we conducted of two trials, we found no significant difference in infection rates for puerperal women (two RCTs; 594 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence (CI) 0.42 to 1.04). No significant differences were found in neonatal umbilical infection rates (two RCTs; 592 women; RR 3.16, 95% CI 0.50 to 19.82; I² 0%. In addition, meta‐analysis of two studies found that there were no significant differences in the degree of perineal tear between groups. Finally, meta‐analysis of two trials found no significant differences in the mean duration of labour. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence provided by the four included RCTs shows that enemas do not have a significant beneficial effect on infection rates such as perineal wound infection or other neonatal infections and women's satisfaction. These findings speak against the routine use of enemas during labour, therefore, such practice should be discouraged.
