Background
Tonic‐clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a tonic‐clonic convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and require urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. International consensus is that an anticonvulsant drug should be administered for any tonic‐clonic convulsion that has been continuing for at least five minutes. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are traditionally regarded as first‐line drugs and phenobarbital, phenytoin and paraldehyde as second‐line drugs. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and updated in 2008. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsant drugs used to treat any acute tonic‐clonic convulsion of any duration, including established convulsive (tonic‐clonic) status epilepticus in children who present to a hospital or emergency medical department. 
Search methods
For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (23 May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 23 May 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 23 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 May 2017), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 23 May 2017). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing any anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of an acute tonic‐clonic convulsion including convulsive status epilepticus in children. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
The review includes 18 randomised trials involving 2199 participants, and a range of drug treatment options, doses and routes of administration (rectal, buccal, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous). The studies vary by design, setting and population, both in terms of their ages and also in their clinical situation. We have made many comparisons of drugs and of routes of administration of drugs in this review; our key findings are as follows:
