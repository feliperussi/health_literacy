Background
Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with ordinary antipsychotic drug treatment. In these cases, various add‐on medications are used, and valproate is one of these. 
Objectives
To examine whether:
1. valproate alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses; and 
2. valproate augmentation of antipsychotic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (July 2002; February 2007; July 2012; March 04, 2016). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of relevant studies in order to identify further trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing valproate to antipsychotics or to placebo (or no intervention), whether as the sole agent or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers, and re‐inspected and quality‐assessed these. At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
The 2012 update search identified 19 further relevant studies, most of which were from China. Thus the review currently includes 26 studies with a total of 2184 participants. All trials examined the effectiveness of valproate as an adjunct to antipsychotics. With the exception of two studies, the studies were small, the participants and personnel were not blinded (neither was outcome assessment), and most were short‐term and incompletely reported.
