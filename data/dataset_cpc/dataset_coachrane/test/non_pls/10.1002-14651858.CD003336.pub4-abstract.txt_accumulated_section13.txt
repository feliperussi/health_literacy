Background
People with chronic heart failure (HF) are at risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral arterial embolism; coronary ischaemic events also contribute to the progression of HF. The use of long‐term oral anticoagulation is established in certain populations, including people with HF and atrial fibrillation (AF), but there is wide variation in the indications and use of oral anticoagulation in the broader HF population. 
Objectives
To determine whether long‐term oral anticoagulation reduces total deaths and stroke in people with heart failure in sinus rhythm. 
Search methods
We updated the searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in March 2020. We screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from national and international cardiovascular meetings to identify unpublished studies. We contacted relevant authors to obtain further data. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing oral anticoagulants with placebo or no treatment in adults with HF, with treatment duration of at least one month. We made inclusion decisions in duplicate, and resolved any disagreements between review authors by discussion, or a third party. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, and assessed the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy by calculating odds ratio (OR), accompanied by the 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified three RCTs (5498 participants). One RCT compared warfarin, aspirin, and no antithrombotic therapy, the second compared warfarin with placebo in participants with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and the third compared rivaroxaban with placebo in participants with HF and coronary artery disease. 
We pooled data from the studies that compared warfarin with a placebo or no treatment. We are uncertain if there is an effect on all‐cause death (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.18; 2 studies, 324 participants; low‐certainty evidence); warfarin may increase the risk of major bleeding events (OR 5.98, 95% CI 1.71 to 20.93; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 17; 2 studies, 324 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the studies reported stroke as an individual outcome.
