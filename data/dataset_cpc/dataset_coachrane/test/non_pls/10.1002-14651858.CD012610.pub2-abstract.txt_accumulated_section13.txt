Background
Ready‐to‐use lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) are a highly nutrient‐dense supplement, which could be a good source of macro‐ and micronutrients for pregnant women who need to supplement their nutrient intake. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of LNS for maternal, birth and infant outcomes in pregnant women. Secondary objectives were to explore the most appropriate composition, frequency and duration of LNS administration. 
Search methods
In May 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 22 other databases and two trials registers for any published and ongoing studies. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, and we contacted the authors of included studies and other experts in the field to identify any studies we may have missed, including any unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared LNS given in pregnancy to no intervention, placebo, iron folic acid (IFA), multiple micronutrients (MMN) or nutritional counselling. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane procedures.
Main results
We included four studies in 8018 pregnant women. All four studies took place in stable community settings in low‐ and middle‐income countries: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Malawi. None were in emergency settings. The oldest trial was published in 2009. Of the four included studies, one compared LNS to IFA, one compared LNS to MMN, and two compared LNS to both IFA and MMN. 
We considered the included studies to be of medium to high quality, and we rated the quality of the evidence as moderate using the GRADE approach.
