Our analyses show that community health educational interventions had a significant impact on reducing overall neonatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.96; random‐effects model; 26 studies; n = 553,111; I² = 88%; very low‐quality evidence), early neonatal mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.84; random‐effects model; 15 studies that included 3 subsets from 3 studies; n = 321,588; I² = 86%; very low‐quality evidence), late neonatal mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74; random‐effects model; 11 studies; n = 186,643; I² = 88%; very low‐quality evidence), and perinatal mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91; random‐effects model; 15 studies; n = 262,613; I² = 81%; very low‐quality evidence). Moreover, community health educational interventions increased utilisation of any antenatal care (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.22; random‐effects model; 18 studies; n = 307,528; I² = 96%) and initiation of breastfeeding (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.77; random‐effects model; 19 studies; n = 126,375; I² = 99%). In contrast, community health educational interventions were found to have a non‐significant impact on use of modern contraceptives (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.41; random‐effects model; 3 studies; n = 22,237; I² = 80%); presence of skilled birth attendance at birth (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.25; random‐effects model; 10 studies; n = 117,870; I² = 97%); utilisation of clean delivery kits (RR 4.44, 95% CI 0.71 to 27.76; random‐effects model; 2 studies; n = 17,087; I² = 98%); and care‐seeking (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27; random‐effects model; 7 studies; n = 46,154; I² = 93%).
