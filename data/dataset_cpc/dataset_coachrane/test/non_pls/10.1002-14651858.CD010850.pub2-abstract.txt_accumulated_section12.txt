Background
Advances in minimally invasive surgery for live kidney donors have led to the development of laparoendoscopic single site donor nephrectomy (LESS‐DN). At present, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is the technique of choice for donor nephrectomy globally. Compared with open surgical approaches, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is associated with decreased morbidity, faster recovery times and return to normal activity, and shorter hospital stays. LESS‐DN differs from standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy; LESS‐DN requires a single incision through which the procedure is performed and donor kidney is removed. Previous studies have hypothesised that LESS‐DN may provide additional benefits for kidney donors and stimulate increased donor rates. 
Objectives
This review looked at the benefits and harms of LESS‐DN compared with standard laparoscopic nephrectomy for live kidney donors. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 28 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared LESS‐DN with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and conducted risk of bias evaluation. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) or risk difference (RD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included three studies (179 participants) comparing LESS‐DN with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. There were no significant differences between LESS‐DN and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy for mean operative time (2 studies, 79 participants: MD 6.36 min, 95% CI ‐11.85 to 24.57), intra‐operative blood loss (2 studies, 79 participants: MD ‐8.31 mL, 95% CI ‐23.70 to 7.09), or complication rates (3 studies, 179 participants: RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.14). Pain scores at discharge were significantly less in the LESS‐DN group (2 studies, 79 participants: MD ‐1.19, 95% CI ‐2.17 to ‐0.21). For all other outcomes (length of hospital stay; length of time to return to normal activities; blood transfusions; conversion to another form of surgery; warm ischaemia time; total analgesic requirement; graft loss) there were no significant differences observed.
