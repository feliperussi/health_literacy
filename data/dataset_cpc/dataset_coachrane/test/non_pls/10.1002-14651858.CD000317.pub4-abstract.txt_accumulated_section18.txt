Background
The first‐line treatment in donor sperm treatment consists of inseminations that can be done by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or by intracervical insemination (ICI). 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracervical insemination (ICI) in women who start donor sperm treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL in October 2016, checked references of relevant studies, and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the Grey literature, and five trials registers on 15 December 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on IUI versus ICI in natural cycles or with ovarian stimulation, and RCTs comparing different cointerventions in IUI and ICI. We included cross‐over studies if pre‐cross‐over data were available. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We collected data on primary outcomes of live birth and multiple pregnancy rates, and on secondary outcomes of clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and cancellation rates. 
Main results
We included six RCTs (708 women analysed) on ICI and IUI in donor sperm treatment. Two studies compared IUI and ICI in natural cycles, two studies compared IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles, and two studies compared timing of IUI and ICI. There was very low‐quality evidence; the main limitations were risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. 
IUI versus ICI in natural cycles 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in live birth rate between IUI and ICI in natural cycles (odds ratio (OR) 3.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 87.13; 1 RCT, 26 women; very low‐quality evidence). There was only one live birth in this study (in the IUI group). IUI resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates (OR 6.18, 95% CI 1.91 to 20.03; 2 RCTs, 76 women; I² = 48%; very low‐quality evidence). 
No multiple pregnancies or miscarriages occurred in this study.
IUI versus ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference in live birth rate between IUI and ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles (OR 2.55, 95% CI 0.72 to 8.96; 1 RCT, 43 women; very low‐quality evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a live birth following ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles was assumed to be 30%, the chance following IUI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles would be between 24% and 80%. IUI may result in higher clinical pregnancy rates than ICI (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.78; 2 RCTs, 131 women; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). IUI may be associated with higher multiple pregnancy rates than ICI (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 7.69; 2 RCTs, 131 women; I² = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). This suggested that if the risk of multiple pregnancy following ICI in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles was assumed to be 10%, the risk following IUI would be between 10% and 46%. 
We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any clear difference between the groups in miscarriage rates in gonadotrophin‐stimulated cycles (OR 1.97, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.04; 2 RCTs, overall 67 pregnancies; I² = 50%; very low‐quality evidence).
