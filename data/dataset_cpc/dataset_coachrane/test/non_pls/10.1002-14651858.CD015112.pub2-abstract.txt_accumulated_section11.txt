Background
Although many people infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2) experience no or mild symptoms, some individuals can develop severe illness and may die, particularly older people and those with underlying medical problems. Providing evidence‐based interventions to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection has become more urgent with the spread of more infectious SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern (VoC), and the potential psychological toll imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic.   
Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers. When it comes to the transmission of viruses, such as SARS‐CoV‐2, workplaces should first consider control measures that can potentially have the most significant impact. According to the hierarchy of controls, one should first consider elimination (and substitution), then engineering controls, administrative controls, and lastly, personal protective equipment (PPE). 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of interventions in non‐healthcare‐related workplaces to reduce the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection relative to other interventions, or no intervention. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), Clinicaltrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 14 September 2021. We will conduct an update of this review in six months. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised control trials (RCT) and planned to include non‐randomised studies of interventions. We included adult workers, both those who come into close contact with clients or customers (e.g. public‐facing employees, such as cashiers or taxi drivers), and those who do not, but who could be infected by co‐workers. We excluded studies involving healthcare workers. We included any intervention to prevent or reduce workers' exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 in the workplace, defining categories of intervention according to the hierarchy of hazard controls, i.e. elimination; engineering controls; administrative controls; personal protective equipment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (or other respiratory viruses), SARS‐CoV‐2‐related mortality, adverse events, and absenteeism from work. Our secondary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, quality of life, hospitalisation, and uptake, acceptability, or adherence to strategies. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias, and GRADE methods to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.
