Background
Free oxygen radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Superoxide dismutase is a naturally occurring enzyme which provides a defence against such oxidant injury. Exogenously administered superoxide dismutase has been tested in clinical trials to prevent chronic lung disease in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To determine if exogenously administered superoxide dismutase is efficacious in the prevention of chronic lung disease in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated, and efficacious in decreasing the following outcomes: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus and mortality. To determine the frequency and nature of adverse effects of superoxide dismutase. 
Search methods
We searched Medline (1966 ‐ 2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) using the following keywords: {bronchopulmonary dysplasia OR chronic lung disease} AND superoxide dismutase, limited to human studies in newborn infants (infant, newborn). We hand searched the reference lists of articles located and the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research (USA) (published in Pediatric Research) from 1980 ‐ 2000. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials where subjects were preterm infants who had developed or were at risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome requiring assisted ventilation and who were randomly allocated to receive either superoxide dismutase (in any form, by any route) or placebo or no treatment. We included studies which reported any of the following outcomes: chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, any intraventricular hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage grades III/IV, patent ductus arteriosus, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal mortality, death prior to discharge and neurodevelopmental outcome.
