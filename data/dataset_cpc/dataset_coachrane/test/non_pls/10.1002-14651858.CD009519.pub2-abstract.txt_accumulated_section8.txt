Background
A major determinant of treatment offered to patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is their intrathoracic (mediastinal) nodal status. If the disease has not spread to the ipsilateral mediastinal nodes, subcarinal (N2) nodes, or both, and the patient is otherwise considered fit for surgery, resection is often the treatment of choice. Planning the optimal treatment is therefore critically dependent on accurate staging of the disease. PET‐CT (positron emission tomography–computed tomography) is a non‐invasive staging method of the mediastinum, which is increasingly available and used by lung cancer multidisciplinary teams. Although the non‐invasive nature of PET‐CT constitutes one of its major advantages, PET‐CT may be suboptimal in detecting malignancy in normal‐sized lymph nodes and in ruling out malignancy in patients with coexisting inflammatory or infectious diseases. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET‐CT for mediastinal staging of patients with suspected or confirmed NSCLC that is potentially suitable for treatment with curative intent. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 30 April 2013: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via OvidSP (from 1946), Embase via OvidSP (from 1974), PreMEDLINE via OvidSP, OpenGrey, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and the trials register www.clinicaltrials.gov. There were no language or publication status restrictions on the search. We also contacted researchers in the field, checked reference lists, and conducted citation searches (with an end‐date of 9 July 2013) of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Prospective or retrospective cross‐sectional studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET‐CT for diagnosing N2 disease in patients with suspected resectable NSCLC. The studies must have used pathology as the reference standard and reported participants as the unit of analysis.
