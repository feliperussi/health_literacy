Background
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in both sexes worldwide. Approximately 50% of those diagnosed with lung cancer will have locally advanced or metastatic disease and will be treated in a palliative setting. Platinum‐based combination chemotherapy has benefits in terms of survival and symptom control when compared with best supportive care. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of carboplatin‐based chemotherapy when compared with cisplatin‐based chemotherapy, both in combination with a third‐generation drug, in people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To compare quality of life in people with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and carboplatin combined with a third‐generation drug. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 13 January 2019), MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to 13 January 2019), and Embase (via Ovid) (1974 to 13 January 2019). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meetings (January 1990 to September 2018) and reference lists from relevant resources. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin combined with a third‐generation drug in people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We accepted any regimen and number of cycles that included these drugs, since there is no widely accepted standard regimen. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the search results, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. The primary outcomes were overall survival and health‐related quality of life. The secondary outcomes were one‐year survival rate, objective response rate and toxicity.
