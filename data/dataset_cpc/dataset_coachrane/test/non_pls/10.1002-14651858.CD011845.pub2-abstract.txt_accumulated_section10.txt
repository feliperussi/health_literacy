Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self‐care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow‐up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. 
Objectives
To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth‐delivered education for people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth‐delivered education such as internet and web‐based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media‐delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria.
