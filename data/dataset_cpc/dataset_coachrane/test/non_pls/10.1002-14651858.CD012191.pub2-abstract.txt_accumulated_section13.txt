Background
Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the second cause of death for cancer in women. Cancer prevention agents (CPAs) are a promising approach to reduce the burden of breast cancer. Currently, two main types of CPAs are available: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs, such as exemestane and anastrozole). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of single CPAs for the prevention of primary breast cancer, in unaffected women, at an above‐average risk of developing breast cancer. 
Using a network meta‐analysis, to rank single CPAs, based on their efficacy and acceptability (an endpoint that is defined as the inverse of CPA‐related toxicity). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 August 2018. We handsearched reference lists to identify additional relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women without a personal history of breast cancer but with an above‐average risk of developing a tumor. Women had to be treated with a CPA and followed up to record the occurrence of breast cancer and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments of the included studies, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Outcome data included incidence of breast carcinoma (both invasive and in situ carcinoma) and adverse events (both overall and severe toxicity). We performed a conventional meta‐analysis (for direct comparisons of a single CPA with placebo or a different CPA) and network meta‐analysis (for indirect comparisons). 
Main results
We included six studies enrolling 50,927 women randomized to receive one CPA (SERMs: tamoxifen or raloxifene, or AIs: exemestane or anastrozole) or placebo. Three studies compared tamoxifen and placebo, two studies compared AIs (exemestane or anastrozole) versus placebo, and one study compared tamoxifen versus raloxifene. The risk of bias was low for all RCTs.
