Background
LAAM and methadone are both opiate agonists and have been shown to reduce dependence on heroin when given continuously under supervised dosing conditions. LAAM has a long duration of action requiring dosing every two/three days compared to methadone which requires daily dosing. LAAM is not as widely available internationally as methadone, and may be withdrawn from the market following ten cases of life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias and an association with QT prolongation. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and acceptability of LAAM maintenance with methadone maintenance in the treatment of heroin dependence. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 ‐ August 2000), PsycINFO (1887 ‐ August 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 ‐ August 2000), and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2 2000). We hand searched NIDA monographs until August 2000 and reference lists of articles. The specialised register of trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol was searched until February 2003. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and controlled prospective studies comparing LAAM and methadone maintenance for the treatment of heroin dependence, outcomes of efficacy or acceptability were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Data on retention in treatment, heroin use, side‐effects and mortality were collected by two reviewers independently. A meta‐analysis was performed using RevMan. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. 
Main results
Eighteen studies, (15 RCTs, 3 Controlled prospective studies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Three were excluded from the meta‐analysis due to lack of data on retention, heroin use or mortality. Cessation of allocated medication (11 studies, 1473 participants) was greater with LAAM than with methadone, (RR 1.36, 95%CI 1.07‐1.73, p=0.001, NNT=7.7 (or 8)). Non‐abstinence was less with LAAM (5 studies, 983 participants; RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.72‐0.91, p=0.0003, NNT=9.1 (or 10)). In 10 studies (1441 participants) there were 6 deaths from a range of causes, 5 in participants assigned to LAAM (RR 2.28 (95%CI 0.59‐8.9, p=0.2). other relevant outcomes, such as quality of life and criminal activity could not be analysed because of lack of information in the primary studies.
