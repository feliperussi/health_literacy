Background
Current guidelines recommend screening of people with oesophageal varices via oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy at the time of diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis. This requires that people repeatedly undergo unpleasant invasive procedures with their attendant risks, although half of these people have no identifiable oesophageal varices 10 years after the initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. Platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio are non‐invasive tests proposed as triage tests for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices. 
Objectives
Primary objectives  
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices of any size in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of these non‐invasive tests as triage or replacement of oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy. 
Secondary objectives  
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of these same tests for the diagnosis of high‐risk oesophageal varices in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. 
We aimed to perform pair‐wise comparisons between the three index tests, while considering predefined cut‐off values. 
We investigated sources of heterogeneity.
Search methods
The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Register, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and Science Citation Index ‐ Expanded (Web of Science) (14 June 2016). We applied no language or document‐type restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices via oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy as the reference standard in children or adults of any age with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, who did not have variceal bleeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Standard Cochrane methods as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test of Accuracy Reviews. 
Main results
We included 71 studies, 67 of which enrolled only adults and four only children. All included studies were cross‐sectional and were undertaken at a tertiary care centre. Eight studies reported study results in abstracts or letters. We considered all but one of the included studies to be at high risk of bias. We had major concerns about defining the cut‐off value for the three index tests; most included studies derived the best cut‐off values a posteriori, thus overestimating accuracy; 16 studies were designed to validate the 909 (n/mm3)/mm cut‐off value for platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio. Enrolment of participants was not consecutive in six studies and was unclear in 31 studies. Thirty‐four studies assessed enrolment consecutively. Eleven studies excluded some included participants from the analyses, and in only one study, the time interval between index tests and the reference standard was longer than three months. 
Diagnosis of varices of any size. Platelet count showed sensitivity of 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.77) and specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) (cut‐off value of around 150,000/mm3 from 140,000 to 150,000/mm3; 10 studies, 2054 participants). When examining potential sources of heterogeneity, we found that of all predefined factors, only aetiology had a role: studies including participants with chronic hepatitis C reported different results when compared with studies including participants with mixed aetiologies (P = 0.036). Spleen length showed sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.54 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.62) (cut‐off values of around 110 mm, from 110 to 112.5 mm; 13 studies, 1489 participants). Summary estimates for detection of varices of any size showed sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.97) and specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) in 17 studies, and 2637 participants had a cut‐off value for platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio of 909 (n/mm3)/mm. We found no effect of predefined sources of heterogeneity. An overall indirect comparison of the HSROCs of the three index tests showed that platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio was the most accurate index test when compared with platelet count (P < 0.001) and spleen length (P < 0.001). 
Diagnosis of varices at high risk of bleeding. Platelet count showed sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.77) (cut‐off value of around 150,000/mm3 from 140,000 to 160,000/mm3; seven studies, 1671 participants). For spleen length, we obtained only a summary ROC curve as we found no common cut‐off between studies (six studies, 883 participants). Platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio showed sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.93) and specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.77) (cut‐off value of around 909 (n/mm3)/mm; from 897 to 921 (n/mm3)/mm; seven studies, 642 participants). An overall indirect comparison of the HSROCs of the three index tests showed that platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio was the most accurate index test when compared with platelet count (P = 0.003) and spleen length (P < 0.001).
