Background
Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition of the alimentary tract with a high morbidity secondary to bowel inflammation. High levels of tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) have been associated with the development of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease.Thalidomide, has been demonstrated to have anti TNF‐α properties in experimental and clinical studies. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2008, PUBMED (1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (1984 to August 2008) and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Specialised Trial Register were searched. Manufacturers of thalidomide and leaders in the field were also contacted to identify any unpublished trials. Study references were also searched for additional trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thalidomide or lenalidomide against placebo or any other intervention for induction of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was clinical remission. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
No published RCTs on thalidomide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease were found. One RCT in paediatric patients is in progress. One RCT using lenalidomide (n = 89) met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. Three parallel groups of patients on 25 mg of lenalidomide daily (n = 23) , 5 mg of lenalidomide daily (n = 33) or placebo (n = 28) were studied. The clinical remission rate in both treatment groups was not significantly different from that in the placebo group; 25 mg lenalidomide versus placebo (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.54), 5 mg lenalidomide versus placebo (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.42 to 4.05). There were no statistically significant differences in clinical response. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of one well designed study using lenalidomide did not show any statistically significant benefit over placebo. The use of thalidomide or lenalidomide for induction of remission in Crohn's disease is not recommended until data from a definitive study are available.
