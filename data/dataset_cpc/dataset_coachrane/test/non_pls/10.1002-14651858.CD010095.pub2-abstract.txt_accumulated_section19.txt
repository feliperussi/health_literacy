Background
Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion. 
Main results
This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. 
The evidence for short‐term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short‐term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short‐term use of famciclovir. 
Long‐term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long‐term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4‐month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4‐month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long‐term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long‐term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) ‐0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI ‐0.16 to ‐0.05; n = 120). 
These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). 
There was no evidence to show that short‐term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). 
The efficacy of long‐term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research‐diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant‐reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5‐pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2‐hydroxypropyl‐β‐cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). 
These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. 
Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events.
