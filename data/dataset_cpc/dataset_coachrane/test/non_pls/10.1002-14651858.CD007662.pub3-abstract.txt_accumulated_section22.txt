Background
Trichotillomania (TTM; hair‐pulling disorder) is a prevalent and disabling disorder characterised by recurrent hair‐pulling. Here we update a previous Cochrane Review on the effects of medication for TTM. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of medication for trichotillomania (TTM) in adults, children and adolescents compared with placebo or other medication. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, eleven other bibliographic databases, trial registries and grey literature sources (to 26 November 2020). We checked reference lists and contacted subject experts. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials of medication versus placebo or other medication for TTM in adults, children and adolescents. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Twelve studies were included. We identified 10 studies in adults (286 participants) with a mean sample size of 29 participants per trial; one study in children and adolescents (39 participants); and, one study in adults and adolescents (22 participants: 18 adults and 4 adolescents). All studies were single‐centre, outpatient trials. Eleven studies compared medication and placebo (334 participants); one study compared two medications (13 participants). Studies were 5 to 13 weeks duration. We undertook meta‐analysis only for opioid antagonists as other comparisons contained a single study, or reported insufficient data. 
Antioxidants versus placebo in adults 
There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (35.7%) and placebo groups (28.6%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 5.99; 36 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (18 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Antioxidants versus placebo in adolescents 
There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (50%) and placebo groups (25%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 14.20; 8 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (8 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Antipsychotics versus placebo in adults 
There may be greater treatment response in the antipsychotic group (85%) compared to the placebo group (17%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of olanzapine (RR 5.08, 95% CI 1.4 to 18.37; 25 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (25 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Cell signal transducers versus placebo in adults 
There was little to no difference in treatment response between cell signal transducer (42.1%) and placebo groups (31.6%) after 10 weeks, based on a single trial of inositol (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.11; 38 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (38 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Glutamate modulators versus placebo in adults 
There is probably greater treatment response in the glutamate modulator group (56%) compared to the placebo group (16%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of N‐acetylcysteine (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.17; 50 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (50 participants; low‐certainty evidence).
