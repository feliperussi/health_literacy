Background
The UK prevalence of thoracic aneurysm is estimated at 10.4 per 100,000 person‐years. Progressive and unpredictable enlargement can lead to rupture. Endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms involves a stent graft system being introduced via the femoral artery and manipulated within the aorta under radiological guidance. Following endograft deployment, a seal is formed at the proximal and distal landing zones to exclude the aneurysm sac from the circulation. With the increasing popularity of endovascular repair there has been an increase in the number of commercially available stent graft designs on the market. This is an update of the review first published in 2013. 
Objectives
This review aimed to assess the different stent graft types for endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies CENTRAL (2015, Issue 1). Trial databases were searched by the TSC for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of stent graft types in the repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms were sought without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Main results
No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. It was not possible to assess the quality of the evidence in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Unfortunately, no data exist regarding direct comparisons of the performance of different stent graft types. High quality RCTs evaluating stent graft types in thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair are required.
