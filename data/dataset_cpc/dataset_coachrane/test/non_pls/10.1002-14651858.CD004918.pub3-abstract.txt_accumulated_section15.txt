Background
Aqueous shunts are employed to control intraocular pressure (IOP) for people with primary or secondary glaucomas who fail or are not candidates for standard surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of aqueous shunts for reducing IOP in glaucoma compared with standard surgery, another type of aqueous shunt, or modification to the aqueous shunt procedure. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August 2016), Embase.com (1947 to August 2016), PubMed (1948 to August 2016), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to August 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 15 August 2016, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 15 August 2016. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 August 2016. We also searched the reference lists of identified trial reports and the Science Citation Index to find additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials that compared various types of aqueous shunts with standard surgery or to each other in eyes with glaucoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data from included trials. We contacted trial investigators when data were unclear or not reported. We graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We followed standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included 27 trials with a total of 2099 participants with mixed diagnoses and comparisons of interventions. Seventeen studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and seven reported adequate allocation concealment. Data collection and follow‐up times varied. 
Four trials compared an aqueous shunt (Ahmed or Baerveldt) with trabeculectomy, of which three reported one‐year outcomes. At one‐year, the difference in IOP between aqueous shunt groups and trabeculectomy groups was uncertain (mean difference (MD) 2.55 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.78 to 5.87; 380 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The difference in logMAR visual acuity was also uncertain (MD 0.12 units, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.31; 380 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In two trials, the difference in visual field score was uncertain (MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐1.91 to 1.40; 196 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications was higher in the aqueous shunt group than the trabeculectomy group in one trial (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.12; 184 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on needing additional glaucoma surgery was uncertain between groups in two trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.36; 329 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In one trial, fewer total adverse events were reported in the aqueous shunt group than the trabeculectomy group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81; 212 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No trial reported quality‐of‐life outcomes at one‐year follow‐up. 
Two trials that compared the Ahmed implant with the Baerveldt implant for glaucoma found higher mean IOP in the Ahmed group at one‐year follow‐up (MD 2.60 mmHg, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.62; 464 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The difference in logMAR visual acuity was uncertain between groups (MD ‐0.07 units, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.13; 501 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The MD in number of antiglaucoma medications was within one between groups (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.59; 464 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). More participants in the Ahmed group required additional glaucoma surgery than the Baerveldt group (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.02 to 7.54; 514 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The two trials reported specific adverse events but not overall number of adverse events. Neither trial reported visual field or quality‐of‐life outcomes at one‐year follow‐up. 
One trial compared the Ahmed implant with the Molteno implant for glaucoma over two‐year follow‐up. Mean IOP was higher in the Ahmed group than the Molteno group (MD 1.64 mmHg, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 57 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The differences in logMAR visual acuity (MD 0.08 units, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.40; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and mean deviation in visual field (MD ‐0.18 dB, 95% CI ‐3.13 to 2.77; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) were uncertain between groups. The mean number of antiglaucoma medications was also uncertain between groups (MD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐1.03 to 0.27; 57 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The trial did not report the proportion needing additional glaucoma surgery, total adverse events, or quality‐of‐life outcomes.
