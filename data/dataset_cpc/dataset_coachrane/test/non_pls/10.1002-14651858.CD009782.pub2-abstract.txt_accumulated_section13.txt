Background
Trabeculectomy is performed as a treatment for glaucoma to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). The surgical procedure involves creating a channel through the wall of the eye. However scarring during wound healing can block this channel which will lead to the operation failing. Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents have been proposed to slow down healing response and scar formation. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of anti‐VEGF therapies administered by subconjunctival injection for the outcome of trabeculectomy at 12 months follow‐up and to examine the balance of benefit and harms when compared to any other anti‐scarring agents or no additional anti‐scarring agents. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to November 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 12 November 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti‐VEGF therapies administered by subconjunctival injection compared to any other anti‐scarring agents or no additional anti‐scarring agents (no treatment or placebo) in trabeculectomy surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was successful trabeculectomy at 12 months after surgery which was defined as achieving a target IOP (usually no more than 21 mm Hg) without any additional intervention. Other outcomes included: qualified success (achieving target IOP with or without additional intervention), mean IOP and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (175 participants, 177 eyes) that met the inclusion criteria in this review. 
One trial conducted in Iran (37 participants, 37 eyes) compared anti‐VEGF (bevacizumab 0.2 mg) versus control (sham injection) in people with refractory glaucoma. We judged this study to be at low risk of bias.The primary outcome of this review was not reported; mean IOP at three months was 15.1 mm Hg (standard deviation 1.0) in both anti‐VEGF and control groups.
