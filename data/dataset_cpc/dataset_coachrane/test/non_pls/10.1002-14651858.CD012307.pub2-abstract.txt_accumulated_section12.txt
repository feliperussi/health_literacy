Background
Pulmonary transplantation is the final treatment option for people with end‐stage respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that exercise training may contribute to speeding up physical recovery in adults undergoing lung transplantation, helping to minimize or resolve impairments due to physical inactivity in both the pre‐ and post‐transplant stages. However, there is a lack of detailed guidelines on how exercise training should be carried out in this specific sub‐population. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and safety of exercise training in adult patients who have undergone lung transplantation, measuring the maximal and functional exercise capacity; health‐related quality of life; adverse events; patient readmission; pulmonary function; muscular strength; pathological bone fractures; return to normal activities and death. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 6 October 2020 using relevant search terms for this review. Studies in the CKTR are identified through CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE searches, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included comparing exercise training with usual care or no exercise training, or with another exercise training program in terms of dosage, modality, program length, or use of supporting exercise devices. The study population comprised of participants older than 18 years who underwent lung transplantation independent of their underlying respiratory pathology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed all records identified by the search strategy and selected studies that met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. In the first instance, the disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible the decision was taken by a third reviewer. The same reviewers independently extracted outcome data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Eight RCTs (438 participants) were included in this review. The median sample size was 60 participants with a range from 16 to 83 participants. The mean age of participants was 54.9 years and 51.9% of the participants were male. The median duration of the exercise training programs for the groups undergoing the intervention was 13 weeks, and the median duration of training in the active control groups was four weeks. Overall the risk of bias was considered to be high, mainly due to the inability to blind the study participants and the selective reporting of the results.
