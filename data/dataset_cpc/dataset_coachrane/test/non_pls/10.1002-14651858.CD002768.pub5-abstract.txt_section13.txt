This Cochrane Review shows that, in studies with an active training programme lasting over six months in people with CF, physical activity probably has a positive effect on exercise capacity when compared to no physical activity (usual care) (mean difference (MD) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 3.05; 6 RCTs, 348 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The magnitude of improvement in exercise capacity is interpreted as small, although study results were heterogeneous. Physical activity interventions may have no effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted) (MD 2.41, 95% CI ‒0.49 to 5.31; 6 RCTs, 367 participants), HRQoL physical functioning (MD 2.19, 95% CI ‒3.42 to 7.80; 4 RCTs, 247 participants) and HRQoL respiratory domain (MD ‒0.05, 95% CI ‒3.61 to 3.51; 4 RCTs, 251 participants) at six months and longer (low‐certainty evidence). One study (117 participants) reported no differences between the physical activity and control groups in the number of participants experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation by six months (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.94) or in the time to first exacerbation over 12 months (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.80) (both high‐certainty evidence); and no effects of physical activity on diabetic control (after 1 hour: MD ‒0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI ‒1.11 to 1.03; 67 participants; after 2 hours: MD ‒0.44 mmol/L, 95% CI ‒1.43 to 0.55; 81 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no difference between groups in the number of adverse events over six months (odds ratio 6.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 53.40; 2 RCTs, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence).
