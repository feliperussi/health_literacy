Background
People with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of a deficiency in fat‐soluble vitamins, including vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency predominantly causes eye and skin problems, while excessive levels of vitamin A can harm the respiratory and skeletal systems in children and interfere with the metabolism of other fat‐soluble vitamins. Most CF centres administer vitamin A as supplements to reduce the frequency of vitamin A deficiency in people with CF and to improve clinical outcomes such as growth, although the recommended dose varies between different guidelines. Thus, a systematic review on vitamin A and vitamin A‐like supplementation (carotenes or other retinoids) in people with CF would help guide clinical practice. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To determine if supplementation with vitamin A, carotenes or other retinoid supplements in children and adults with CF reduces the frequency of vitamin A deficiency disorders, improves general and respiratory health and affects the frequency of vitamin A toxicity. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additionally we searched several ongoing trials registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry. 
Most recent database searches: 01 June 2018.
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing all preparations of oral vitamin A, carotenes or retinoids (or in combination), used as a supplement compared to placebo at any dose, for at least three months, in people with CF (diagnosed by sweat tests or genetic testing) with and without pancreatic insufficiency. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors individually assessed study quality and extracted data on outcome measures. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Investigators were contacted to retrieve missing quantitative data. 
Main results
No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (β)‐carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive β‐carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the low‐dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a wash‐out period after the high‐dose supplementation.
