The results suggest that exercise interventions compared with control interventions have a positive impact on overall HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains. Exercise interventions resulted in improvements in: HRQoL from baseline to 12 weeks' follow‐up (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) or when comparing difference in follow‐up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.47; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79); physical functioning from baseline to 12 weeks' follow‐up (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.22) or 6 months (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.55); or when comparing differences in follow‐up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45) or 6 months (SMD 0.29; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50); role function from baseline to 12 weeks' follow‐up (SMD 0.48; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.90) or when comparing differences in follow‐up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.34) or 6 months (SMD 0.32; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61); and, in social functioning at 12 weeks' follow‐up (SMD 0.54; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.05) or when comparing differences in follow‐up scores at both 12 weeks (SMD 0.16; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.27) and 6 months (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44). Further, exercise interventions resulted in a decrease in fatigue from baseline to 12 weeks' follow‐up (SMD ‐0.38; 95% CI ‐0.57 to ‐0.18) or when comparing difference in follow‐up scores at follow‐up of 12 weeks (SMD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.14 to ‐0.31). Since there is consistency of findings on both types of measures (change scores and difference in follow‐up scores) there is greater confidence in the robustness of these findings.
