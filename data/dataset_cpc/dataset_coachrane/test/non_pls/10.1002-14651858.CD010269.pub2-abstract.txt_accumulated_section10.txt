Background
Sedation reduces patient levels of anxiety and stress, facilitates the delivery of care and ensures safety. Alpha‐2 agonists have a range of effects including sedation, analgesia and antianxiety. They sedate, but allow staff to interact with patients and do not suppress respiration. They are attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of alpha‐2 agonists for sedation of more than 24 hours, compared with traditional sedatives, in mechanically‐ventilated critically ill patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 9 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 9 October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 9 October 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (1982 to 9 October 2014), ISI Web of Science (1987 to 9 October 2014), Chinese Biological Medical Database (1978 to 9 October 2014) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to 9 October 2014), the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform (to 9 October 2014), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of controlled trials active registers (to 9 October 2014), the ClinicalTrials.gov database (to 9 October 2014), the conference proceedings citation index (to 9 October 2014) and the reference lists of included studies and previously published meta‐analyses and systematic reviews for relevant studies. We imposed no language restriction. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing alpha‐2 agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) versus alternative sedatives for long‐term sedation (more than 24 hours) during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We performed meta‐analyses when more than three studies were included, and selected a random‐effects model due to expected clinical heterogeneity. We calculated the geometric mean difference for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We described the effects by values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered two‐sided P < 0.05 to be statistically significant.
