Background
Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in children aged four to 18 years and are a major cause of ill health. The school setting offers the opportunity to deliver preventive interventions to a large number of children and has been used to address a range of public health problems. However, the effectiveness of the school setting for the prevention of different injury mechanisms in school‐aged children is not well understood. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of school‐based educational programmes for the prevention of injuries in children and evaluate their impact on improving children's safety skills, behaviour and practices, and knowledge, and assess their cost‐effectiveness. 
Search methods
We ran searches on the following electronic databases to 26 June 2015: PsycINFO, British Education Index (BEI), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Sociological Abstracts; Latin America and the Caribbean database (LILACS), together with several sources of grey literature. The Cochrane Injuries Information Specialist ran searches, to August 2013, on the Groups Specialised Register (SR‐INJ), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane Library databases, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the ISI Web of Science. In keeping with Cochrane standards, along with Cochrane Injuries' Information Specialist we ran an update search prior to publication (September and October 2016). We have screened the results and placed any relevant studies in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification section of this review.These will be incorporated in the next version of this review, as appropriate.
