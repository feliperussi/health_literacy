Background
Primary care is an important setting in which to treat tobacco addiction. However, the rates at which providers address smoking cessation and the success of that support vary. Strategies can be implemented to improve and increase the delivery of smoking cessation support (e.g. through provider training), and to increase the amount and breadth of support given to people who smoke (e.g. through additional counseling or tailored printed materials). 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of strategies intended to increase the success of smoking cessation interventions in primary care settings. 
To assess whether any effect that these interventions have on smoking cessation may be due to increased implementation by healthcare providers. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries to 10 September 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs) carried out in primary care, including non‐pregnant adults. Studies investigated a strategy or strategies to improve the implementation or success of smoking cessation treatment in primary care. These strategies could include interventions designed to increase or enhance the quality of existing support, or smoking cessation interventions offered in addition to standard care (adjunctive interventions). Intervention strategies had to be tested in addition to and in comparison with standard care, or in addition to other active intervention strategies if the effect of an individual strategy could be isolated. Standard care typically incorporates physician‐delivered brief behavioral support, and an offer of smoking cessation medication, but differs across studies. Studies had to measure smoking abstinence at six months' follow‐up or longer. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome ‐ smoking abstinence ‐ was measured using the most rigorous intention‐to‐treat definition available. We also extracted outcome data for quit attempts, and the following markers of healthcare provider performance: asking about smoking status; advising on cessation; assessment of participant readiness to quit; assisting with cessation; arranging follow‐up for smoking participants. Where more than one study investigated the same strategy or set of strategies, and measured the same outcome, we conducted meta‐analyses using Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects methods to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
