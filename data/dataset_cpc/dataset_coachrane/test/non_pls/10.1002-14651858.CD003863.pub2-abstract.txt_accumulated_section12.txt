Background
Supportive devices such as slings, wheelchair attachments and orthoses have been used to treat subluxation of the shoulder after stroke. 
Objectives
To investigate the effect of supportive devices in preventing subluxation, re‐positioning the head of humerus in the glenoid fossa, decreasing pain, increasing function and adversely increasing contracture in the shoulder after stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched on 22 March 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004), CINAHL (1982 to March 2004), EMBASE (1974 to March 2004), AMED (1985 to March 2004) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro, March 2004). We also handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors for additional information. 
Selection criteria
Studies were included if they were: randomised, quasi‐randomised or controlled trials; participants had a stroke; intervention was supportive devices; and subluxation, pain, function or contracture were measured. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent reviewers examined the identified studies which were assessed for methodological quality and analysed as (1) supportive devices versus no supportive devices or (2) two supportive devices. 
Main results
Four trials (one on slings, three on strapping ‐ 142 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One trial testing a hemisling versus no device reported that no participants had subluxation greater than 10 mm, the same number had lost more than 30 degrees of shoulder external rotation (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 9.3), and more participants in the hemisling group had pain (Peto OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 67.1). The other three showed that strapping was effective in delaying the onset of pain (weighted mean difference (WMD) 14 days, 95% CI 9.7 to 17.8), but was ineffective in reducing pain severity (WMD ‐0.7 cm on a visual analogue scale, 95% CI ‐2.0 to 0.7), increasing upper limb function (WMD 0.8, 95% CI ‐1.5 to 3.1) or affecting the degree of contracture (WMD ‐1.4 degrees, 95% CI ‐10.9 to 8.1) at the shoulder.
