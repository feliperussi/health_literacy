Background
Both inhaled steroids (ICS) and long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABA) are used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This updated review compared compound LABA plus ICS therapy (LABA/ICS) with the LABA component drug given alone. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of ICS and LABA in a single inhaler with mono‐component LABA alone in adults with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. The date of the most recent search was November 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind controlled trials. We included trials comparing compound ICS and LABA preparations with their component LABA preparations in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia, while secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (measured by validated scales), lung function, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, withdrawals due to adverse events and side‐effects. Dichotomous data were analysed as random‐effects model odds ratios or rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data as mean differences and 95% CIs. We rated the quality of evidence for exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia according to recommendations made by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomising 11,794 people with severe COPD. We looked at any LABA plus ICS inhaler (LABA/ICS) versus the same LABA component alone, and then we looked at the 10 studies which assessed fluticasone plus salmeterol (FPS) and the four studies assessing budesonide plus formoterol (BDF) separately. The studies were well‐designed with low risk of bias for randomisation and blinding but they had high rates of attrition, which reduced our confidence in the results for outcomes other than mortality.
