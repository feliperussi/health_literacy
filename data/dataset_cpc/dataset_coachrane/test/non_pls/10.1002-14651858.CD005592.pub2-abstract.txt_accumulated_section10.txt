Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major public health problem around the world due to its increasing prevalence, long duration, caregiver burden, and high financial cost of care. The degeneration of acetylcholine‐containing neurons in the basal forebrain has been implicated in the symptoms of AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors may block the degradation of acetylcholine, thus increasing the efficacy of the remaining cholinergic neurons. Huperzine A is a linearly competitive, reversible inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase that is said to have both central and peripheral activity with the ability to protect cells against hydrogen peroxide, beta‐amyloid protein (or peptide), glutamate, ischemia and staurosporine‐induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These properties might qualify Huperzine A as a promising agent for treating dementia (including AD). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of Huperzine A for the treatment of patients with AD. 
Search methods
The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group was searched on 1 February 2006 using the search term: huperzin*. The CDCIG Specialized register contains records from all major health care databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SIGLE, ISTP, INSIDE, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. In addition, the CBM and AMED databases and relevant websites were searched and some journals were hand‐searched. Specialists in the field were approached for unpublished material and any publications found were searched for additional references. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of Huperzine A for AD. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a self‐developed data extraction form and entered into RevMan 4.2.10 software. Meta‐analyses were performed when more than one trial provided data on a comparable outcome on sufficiently similar patients. Random effects analyses were performed whenever heterogeneity between results appeared to be present. Standardized differences in mean outcome measures were used due to the use of different scales and periods of treatment.
