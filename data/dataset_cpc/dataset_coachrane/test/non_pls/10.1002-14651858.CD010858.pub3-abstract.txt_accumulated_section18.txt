Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic chronic haemolytic and pro‐inflammatory disorder. With increased catabolism and deficits in energy and nutrient intake, individuals with SCD suffer multiple macro‐ and micro‐nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency. This is an update of a previous review. 
Objectives
To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with SCD and to compare different dose regimens. 
To determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on general health (e.g. growth status and health‐related quality of life), on musculoskeletal health (including bone mineral density, pain crises, bone fracture and muscle health), on respiratory health (including lung function, acute chest syndrome, acute exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infections) and the safety of vitamin D supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 March 2020. 
We also searched database such as PubMed, clinical trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 14 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing oral administration of any form of vitamin D supplementation at any dose and for any duration to another type or dose of vitamin D or placebo or no supplementation in people with SCD, of all ages, gender, and phenotypes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. They used the GRADE guidelines to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Vitamin D versus placebo 
One double‐blind RCT (n = 39) compared oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (20 participants) to placebo (19 participants) for six weeks. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow‐up. The study had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, but a low risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. 
Vitamin D supplementation probably led to higher serum 25(OH)D levels at eight weeks, mean difference (MD) 29.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, MD 12.67 (95% CI 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, MD 15.52 (95% CI 13.50 to 17.54) (moderate‐quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% CI 0.14 to 72.84) (low‐quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation probably caused fewer pain days compared to the placebo group at eight weeks, MD ‐10.00 (95% CI ‐16.47 to ‐3.53) (low‐quality evidence), but probably led to a lower (worse) health‐related quality of life score (change from baseline in physical functioning PedsQL scores); at both 16 weeks, MD ‐12.56 (95% CI ‐16.44 to ‐8.69) and 24 weeks, MD ‐12.59 (95% CI ‐17.43 to ‐7.76), although this may not be the case at eight weeks (low‐quality evidence). 
Vitamin D supplementation regimens compared 
Two double‐blind RCTs (83 participants) compared different regimens of vitamin D. One RCT (n = 62) compared oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks, while the second RCT (n = 21) compared oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month for 24 months. Both RCTs had low risk of bias for blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and incomplete outcome data, but the risk of selective outcome reporting bias was high. The bias from randomisation and allocation concealment was low in one study but not in the second. There was an unclear risk of other biases.
