Background
The role of cardiac catheterization in pediatrics has progressed significantly over the last two decades, evolving from a primary diagnostic tool to a primary treatment modality in children with congenital heart disease. Vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis, are among the most common unwanted post‐cardiac catheterization events. In 1974, unfractionated heparin proved to be superior to placebo in decreasing the incidence of arterial thrombosis in pediatric patients. However, the optimal dose of unfractionated heparin to be utilized in this setting remains a matter of controversy. This is an update of the review first published in 2014. 
Objectives
To evaluate the use of low‐dose (< 100 units/kg) versus high‐dose (≥ 100 units/kg) unfractionated heparin administered as an intravenous bolus at the time of initiation of cardiac catheterization (that is, immediately after arterial puncture), with or without subsequent heparin maintenance doses, for the prevention of post‐procedural arterial thrombosis in children. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 15 October 2019. We planned to undertake reference checking of identified trials to identify additional studies. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or quasi‐randomized trials that compared low dose to high dose unfractionated heparin administered prior to cardiac catheterization. We selected studies conducted in children aged 0 to 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
The first screening of potentially eligible studies was conducted by one of the authors (MLA). The second screening, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were independently conducted by two authors (MLA, LRB). Outcomes (thrombotic events, bleeding complications, other complications) were treated as dichotomous variables. The effect measures used were risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.
