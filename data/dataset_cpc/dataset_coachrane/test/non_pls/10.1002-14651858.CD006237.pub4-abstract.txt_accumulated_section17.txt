Background
Work disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of work‐directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included sickness absence days or being off work as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar.  
Main results
In this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. 
Risk of bias 
The most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. 
Work‐directed interventions 
Work‐directed interventionscombined with clinical interventions 
A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces sickness absence days within the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.12; 9 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or 25 fewer days during one year (95% CI ‐37.5 to ‐11.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work beyond one year follow‐up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.83; 2 studies, high‐certainty evidence). The intervention may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.01; 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence) and probably has a small effect on work functioning (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.
