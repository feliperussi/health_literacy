Background
Successful transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral feedings during the immediate neonatal period is associated with improved growth in preterm infants. Lactase is the last of the major intestinal disaccharidases to develop in preterm infants. Because of inadequate lactase activity, preterm infants are unable to digest lactose. Lactase preparations could potentially be used to hydrolyse lactose in formulas and breast milk to minimize lactose malabsorption in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of the addition of lactase to milk compared to placebo or no intervention for the promotion of growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. 
Primary outcomes: weight gain expressed as grams/kg/day, growth expressed as weight, length and head circumference percentile for postmenstrual age (PMA), assessed at birth and at 40 weeks PMA, days to achieve full enteral feeds. Secondary outcomes: several common outcomes associated with preterm birth, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
Electronic and manual searches were conducted in January 2005 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, 2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2005), EMBASE (1980 to Jan 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2005), personal files, bibliographies of identified trials and abstracts by the Pediatric Academic Societies' Meetings and the European Society of Pediatric Research Meetings published in Pediatric Research. The searches were repeated in May 2012 of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings from 2000 to 2012 (Abstracts2View). The Web of Science was searched using the only previously identified trial by Erasmus 2002 as the starting point to search for additional trials that cited this trial. 
Selection criteria
Types of studies: randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials. Participants: preterm infants < 37 weeks PMA. Intervention: addition of lactase to milk versus placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were followed independently by the review authors to assess study quality and report outcomes. Treatment effects, calculated using Review Manager 5, included risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed‐effect model was used for meta‐analyses. We did not perform heterogeneity tests as only one study was identified.
