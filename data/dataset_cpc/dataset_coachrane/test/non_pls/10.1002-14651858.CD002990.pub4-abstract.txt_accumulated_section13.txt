Background
Self‐management interventions help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to acquire and practise the skills they need to carry out disease‐specific medical regimens, guide changes in health behaviour and provide emotional support to enable them to control their disease. Since the 2014 update of this review, several studies have been published. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
To evaluate the effectiveness of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and respiratory‐related hospital admissions.To evaluate the safety of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of respiratory‐related mortality and all‐cause mortality. 
Secondary objectives 
To evaluate the effectiveness of COPD self‐management interventions compared to usual care in terms of other health outcomes and healthcare utilisation.To evaluate effective characteristics of COPD self‐management interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, trials registries and the reference lists of included studies up until January 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised trials (CRTs) published since 1995. To be eligible for inclusion, self‐management interventions had to include at least two intervention components and include an iterative process between participant and healthcare provider(s) in which goals were formulated and feedback was given on self‐management actions by the participant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by reaching consensus or by involving a third review author. We contacted study authors to obtain additional information and missing outcome data where possible. Primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), number of respiratory‐related hospital admissions, respiratory‐related mortality, and all‐cause mortality. When appropriate, we pooled study results using random‐effects modelling meta‐analyses.
