At six to 36 months the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate was statistically significantly improved with etanercept plus DMARD treatment when compared with a DMARD in those people who had an inadequate response to any traditional DMARD (risk ratio (RR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.9, absolute treatment benefit (ATB) 38%; 95% CI 13% to 59%) and in those people who were partial responders to MTX (RR 11.7; 95% CI 1.7 to 82.5, ATB 36%). Similar results were observed when pooling data from all participants (responders or not) (ACR 50 response rates at 24 months: RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.8, ATB 29%; 36 months: RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9, ATB 24%). Statistically significant improvement in physical function and a higher proportion of disease remission were observed in combination‐treated participants compared with DMARDs alone ((mean difference (MD) ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.28 in a 0‐3 scale) and (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.31), respectively) in those people who had an inadequate response to any traditional DMARD. All changes in radiographic scores were statistically significantly less with combination treatment (etanercept plus DMARD) compared with MTX alone for all participants (responders or not) (Total Sharp Score (TSS) (scale = 0 to 448): MD ‐2.2, 95% CI ‐3.0 to ‐1.4; Erosion Score (ES) (scale = 0 to 280): MD ‐1.6; 95% CI ‐2.4 to ‐0.9; Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSNS) (scale = 0 to 168): MD ‐0.7; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.2), and with combination treatment compared with etanercept alone (TSS: MD ‐1.1; 95% CI ‐1.8 to ‐0.5; ES: MD ‐0.7; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.2; JSNS: MD ‐0.5, 95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2). The estimate of irreversible physical disability over 10 years given the radiographic findings was 0.45 out of 3.0.
