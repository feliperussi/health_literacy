Background
Prolonged urinary catheterization is common amongst people in long‐term care settings and this carries a high risk of developing a catheter‐related urinary tract infection and associated complications. A variety of different kinds of urethral catheters are available. Some have been developed specifically to lower the risk of catheter‐associated infection, for example antiseptic or antibiotic impregnated catheters. Ease of use, comfort and handling for the caregivers and patients, and cost‐effectiveness are also important factors influencing choice. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to determine which type of indwelling urinary catheter is best to use for long‐term bladder drainage in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (last searched 31 March 2011), which includes searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised trials comparing types of indwelling urinary catheters for long‐term catheterization in adults. Long‐term catheterization was defined as more than 30 days. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction has been undertaken by two review authors working independently and simultaneously. Any disagreement has been resolved by a third review author. The included trial data were handled according to the methods of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Main results
Three trials were included, involving 102 adults in various settings. Two trials had a parallel group design and one was a randomised cross‐over trial. 
Only two of the six targeted comparisons were assessed by these trials: antiseptic impregnated catheters versus standard catheters (one trial) and one type of standard catheter versus another standard catheter (two trials). 
The single small cross‐over trial was inadequate to assess the value of silver alloy (antiseptic) impregnated catheters. In the two trials comparing different types of standard catheters, estimates of differences were all imprecise because the trials also had small sample sizes; confidence intervals (CI) were too wide to rule out clinically important differences. One trial did suggest, however, that the use of a hydrogel coated latex catheter rather than a silicone catheter may be better tolerated (risk ratio (RR) for need for early removal 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.77).
