Background
Antibiotic therapy for suspected acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) needs to be started immediately, even before the results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and antibiotic sensitivity are available. Immediate commencement of effective treatment using the intravenous route may reduce death and disability. 
Objectives
The objective is to compare the effectiveness and safety of third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) with conventional treatment using penicillin or ampicillin‐chloramphenicol in patients with community‐acquired ABM. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 4, 2011) and EMBASE (January 1974 to April 2011). We also searched the reference list of review articles and book chapters, and contacted experts for any unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) with conventional antibiotics (ampicillin‐chloramphenicol combination, or chloramphenicol alone) as empirical therapy for ABM in adults and children. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the study selection criteria, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. 
Main results
Nineteen trials that involved 1496 patients were included in the analysis. There was no heterogeneity of results among the studies in any outcome except diarrhoea. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the risk of death (risk difference (RD) 0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3% to 2%), risk of deafness (RD ‐4%; 95% CI ‐9% to 1%) or risk of treatment failure (RD ‐1%; 95% CI ‐4% to 2%). However, there were significantly decreased risks of culture positivity of CSF after 10 to 48 hours (RD ‐6%; 95% CI ‐11% to 0%) and statistically significant increases in the risk of diarrhoea between the groups (RD 8%; 95% CI 3% to 13%) with the third generation cephalosporins. The risk of neutropaenia and skin rash were not significantly different between the two groups. However, due to increased antibiotic resistance since the 1980s, the finding of this review should be read with caution.
