Background
Pain on propofol injection is an untoward effect and this condition can reduce patient satisfaction. Intravenous lidocaine injection has been commonly used to attenuate pain on propofol injection. Although many studies have reported that lidocaine was effective in reducing the incidence and severity of pain, nevertheless, no systematic review focusing on lidocaine for preventing high‐intensity pain has been published. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy and adverse effects of lidocaine in preventing high‐intensity pain on propofol injection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 To October 2014), Ovid Embase (1988 to October 2014), LILACS (1992 to October 2014) and searched reference lists of articles. 
We reran the search in November 2015. We found 11 potential studies of interest, those studies were added to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will be fully incorporated into the formal review findings when we update the review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using intravenous lidocaine injection as an intervention to decrease pain on propofol injection in adults. We excluded studies without a placebo or control group. 
Data collection and analysis
We collected selected studies with relevant criteria. We identified risk of bias in five domains according to the following criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, adequacy of blinding, completeness of outcome data and selective reporting. We performed meta‐analysis by direct comparisons of intervention versus control. We estimated the summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals using the random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel method in RevMan 5.3. We used the I2 statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We assessed overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
