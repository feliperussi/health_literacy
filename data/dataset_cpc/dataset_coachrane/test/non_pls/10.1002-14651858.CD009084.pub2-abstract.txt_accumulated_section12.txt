Background
Self‐injurious behaviour among people with intellectual disability is relatively common and often persistent. Self‐injurious behaviour continues to present a challenge to clinicians. It remains poorly understood and difficult to ameliorate despite advances in neurobiology and psychological therapies. There is a strong need for a better evidence base in prescribing and monitoring of drugs in this population, especially since none of the drugs are actually licensed for self‐injurious behaviour. 
Objectives
To determine clinical effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in management of self‐injurious behaviour in adults with intellectual disability. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 19 February 2012: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science, Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Social Science and Humanities, ZETOC and WorldCat. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and the reference lists of included trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that examined drug interventions versus placebo for self‐injurious behaviour (SIB) in adults with intellectual disability. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each trial using a data extraction form. We present a narrative summary of the results is presented. We did not consider meta‐analysis was appropriate due to differences in study designs, differences between interventions and heterogeneous outcome measures. 
Main results
We found five double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials assessed effectiveness and safety of drugs in a total of 50 people with intellectual disability demonstrating SIB. Four trials compared the effects of naltrexone versus placebo and one trial compared clomipramine versus placebo.
