Background
In recent years subintimal angioplasty (SIA) has become an established percutaneous procedure for the treatment of symptomatic lower limb arterial chronic total occlusions. However, the clinical benefits of this practice remain unclear. The aim of the review was to determine the effectiveness of SIA on clinical outcomes. This is an update of a review first published in 2013. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of SIA versus other treatment for people with lower limb arterial chronic total occlusions, determined by the effects on clinical improvement, technical success rate, patency rate, limb salvage rate, and morbidity rates. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (last searched January 2016) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12). We also searched clinical trials registries. 
Selection criteria
We included data from randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of SIA and any other management method in the treatment of lower limb arterial chronic total occlusions. The primary intervention of interest was SIA, with or without a stent, for the restoration of vessel patency in people with occlusions of a lower limb artery. We compared SIA against alternative modalities used to restore vessel patency, including conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, surgical bypass, or any other treatments. We compared different SIA devices and techniques against each other. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data. The third review author resolved disagreements. 
Main results
Two studies, involving a total of 147 participants with TransAtlantic Inter‐Society Consensus (TASC)‐II D femoropopliteal lesions, met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Both studies were small but otherwise of high methodological quality. However, the treatment techniques and control groups of the two studies differed, precluding the combining of study results and resulting in the evidence being less applicable. We therefore considered the quality of the evidence to be low.
