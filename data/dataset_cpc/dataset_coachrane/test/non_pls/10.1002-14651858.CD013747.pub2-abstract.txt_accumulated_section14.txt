Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a disease with an impaired immune response characterized by chronic, relapsing‐remitting, and progressive inflammation mainly affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a biological agent that regulates the impaired immune response by controlling tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNFα). However, the efficacy and safety of long‐term administration of CZP for people with CD with inflammation under control are not well understood. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of CZP for maintenance of remission in people with CD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and conference abstracts from inception to 23 March 2022. We contacted pharmaceutical companies involved with the production of CZP for further relevant information. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CZP with placebo in adults with CD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. The main outcomes were failure to maintain clinical remission at week 26, failure to maintain clinical response at week 26, and serious adverse events. We planned to perform meta‐analyses including all available studies if similar enough for pooling to be appropriate and calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We analyzed the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) to indicate the magnitude of treatment effects. The same two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias by using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework. 
Main results
We identified one study meeting our prespecified eligibility criteria. The included study enrolled 428 adults with CD who responded to induction therapy with CZP 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4. The study evaluated long‐term efficacy and safety of CZP administered subcutaneously every four weeks compared with placebo. 
The proportion of participants who failed to maintain clinical remission at week 26 was 52.3% (113/216) in the CZP group compared to 71.7% (152/212) in the placebo group. Treatment of CZP probably results in a large reduction in failure to maintain clinical remission at week 26 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). The NNTB was 5 (95% CI 4 to 9). We judged this outcome at low risk of bias. Using the GRADE assessment, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate due to the low number of events occurred. 
The proportion of participants who failed to maintain clinical response at week 26 was 37.5% (81/216) in the CZP group compared to 64.2% (136/212) in the placebo group. Treatment of CZP probably results in a large reduction in failure to maintain clinical response at week 26 (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71). The NNTB was 4 (95% CI 3 to 5). We judged this outcome at low risk of bias. Using the GRADE assessment, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate due to the low number of events occurred.
