Four studies, involving a total of 414 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents. The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years. The trials lasted between two months and 12 months. The interventions were based on Pennebaker's method. The risk of bias across most domains of the studies was generally considered to be low, however three of four studies were considered at high risk of bias due to lack of assessor blinding and one study was at high risk of bias for selective reporting. The interpretation of these studies was limited by diverse outcome measurements, measurement tools, control group techniques, and number and/or times of follow‐up. A pooled result from the four studies, including a total of 146 intervention and 135 control participants, indicated uncertain effect in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted between the disclosure group and the control group (mean difference (MD) 3.43%, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.61% to 7.47%; very low‐quality evidence) at ≤ three months' follow‐up. Similarly, evidence from two studies indicated that written emotional disclosure found uncertain effect on forced vital capacity (FVC) (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.26; low‐quality evidence) and asthma symptoms (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.09; low‐quality evidence) but may result in improved asthma control at ≤ three months' follow‐up (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.58; low‐quality evidence). We were unable to pool the data for other outcomes. Results from individual trials did not reveal a significant benefit of written emotional disclosure for quality of life, medication use, healthcare utilisation or psychological well‐being. Evidence from one trial suggests a significant reduction in beta agonist use (MD ‐1.62, 95% CI ‐2.62 to ‐0.62; low‐quality evidence) at ≤ three months' follow‐up in the disclosure group compared with controls. The review did not address any adverse effects of emotional writing.
