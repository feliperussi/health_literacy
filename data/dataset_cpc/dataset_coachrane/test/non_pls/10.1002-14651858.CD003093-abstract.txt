Background
The role of prostaglandins for cervical ripening and induction of labour has been examined extensively. Human semen is the biological source that is presumed to contain the highest prostaglandin concentration. The role of sexual intercourse in the initiation of labour is uncertain. The action of sexual intercourse in stimulating labour is unclear, it may in part be due to the physical stimulation of the lower uterine segment, or endogenous release of oxytocin as a result of orgasm or from the direct action of prostaglandins in semen. Furthermore nipple stimulation may be part of the process of initiation. 
This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of induction. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2007) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two‐stage method of data extraction. 
Main results
There was one included study of 28 women which reported very limited data, from which no meaningful conclusions can be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
The role of sexual intercourse as a method of induction of labour is uncertain. This is an important issue to pregnant women and their partners. There is a need for well‐designed randomised controlled trials to assess the impact of sexual intercourse on the onset of labour. Any future trials investigating sexual intercourse as a method of induction need to be of sufficient power to detect clinically relevant differences in standard outcomes.
