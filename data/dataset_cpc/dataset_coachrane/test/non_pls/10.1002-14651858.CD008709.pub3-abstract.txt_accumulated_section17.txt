Background
Urinary incontinence has been shown to affect up to 50% of women. Studies in the USA have shown that up to 80% of these women have an element of stress urinary incontinence. This imposes significant health and economic burden on society and the women affected. Colposuspension and now mid‐urethral slings have been shown to be effective in treating patients with stress incontinence. However, associated adverse events include bladder and bowel injury, groin pain and haematoma formation. This has led to the development of third‐generation single‐incision slings, also referred to as mini‐slings. 
It should be noted that TVT‐Secur (Gynecare, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) is one type of single‐incision sling; it has been withdrawn from the market because of poor results. However, it is one of the most widely studied single‐incision slings and was used in several of the trials included in this review. Despite its withdrawal from clinical use, it was decided that data pertaining to this sling should be included in the first iteration of this review, so that level 1a data are available in the literature to confirm its lack of efficacy. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of mini‐sling procedures in women with urodynamic clinical stress or mixed urinary incontinence in terms of improved continence status, quality of life or adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched: Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (includes: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process) (searched 6 February 2013); ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (searched 20 September 2012); reference lists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in women with urodynamic stress incontinence, symptoms of stress incontinence or stress‐predominant mixed urinary incontinence, in which at least one trial arm involves one of the new single‐incision slings. The definition of a single‐incision sling is “a sling that does not involve either a retropubic or transobturator passage of the tape or trocar and involves only a single vaginal incision (i.e. no exit wounds in the groin or lower abdomen).” 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible trials and independently extracted data from individual trials. 
Main results
We identified 31 trials involving 3290 women. Some methodological flaws were observed in some trials; a summary of these is given in the 'Risk of bias in included studies' section. 
No studies compared single‐incision slings versus no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, laparoscopic procedures or traditional sub‐urethral slings. No data on the comparison of single‐incision slings versus retropubic mid‐urethral slings (top‐down approach) were available, but the review authors believe this did not affect the overall comparison versus retropubic mid‐urethral slings. 
Types of single‐incision slings included in this review: TVT‐Secur (Gynecare); MiniArc (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, USA); Ajust (CR Bard Inc., Covington, USA); Needleless (Mayumana Healthcare, Lisse, The Netherlands); Ophira (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina); Tissue Fixation System (TFS PTY Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and CureMesh (DMed Co. Inc., Seoul, Korea). 
Women were more likely to remain incontinent after surgery with single‐incision slings than with retropubic slings such as tension‐free vaginal tape (TVTTM) (121/292, 41% vs 72/281, 26%; risk ratio (RR) 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 4.14). Duration of the operation was slightly shorter for single‐incision slings but with higher risk of de novo urgency (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.56). Four of five studies in the comparison included TVT‐Secur as the single‐incision sling. 
Single‐incision slings resulted in higher incontinence rates compared with inside‐out transobturator slings (30% vs 11%; RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.36). The adverse event profile was significantly worse, specifically consisting of higher risks of vaginal mesh exposure (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 9.86), bladder/urethral erosion (RR 17.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 298.88) and operative blood loss (mean difference 18.79, 95% CI 3.70 to 33.88). Postoperative pain was less common with single‐incision slings (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43), and rates of long‐term pain or discomfort were marginally lower, but the clinical significance of these differences is questionable. Most of these findings were derived from the trials involving TVT‐Secur: Excluding the other trials showed that high risk of incontinence was principally associated with use of this device (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.98 to 3.54). It has been withdrawn from clinical use.
