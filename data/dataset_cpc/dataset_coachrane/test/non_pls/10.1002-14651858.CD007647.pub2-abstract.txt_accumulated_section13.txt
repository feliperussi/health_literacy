Background
In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), health services are under‐utilised, and several studies have reported improvements in neonatal outcomes following health education imparted to mothers in homes, at health units, or in hospitals. However, evaluating health educational strategy to deliver newborn care, such as one‐to‐one counselling or group counselling via peer or support groups, or delivered by health professionals, requires rigorous assessment of methodological design and quality, as well as assessment of cost‐effectiveness, affordability, sustainability, and reproducibility in diverse health systems. 
Objectives
To compare a community health educational strategy versus no strategy or the existing approach to health education on maternal and newborn care in LMICs, as imparted to mothers or their family members specifically in community settings during the antenatal and/or postnatal period, in terms of effectiveness for improving neonatal health and survival (i.e. neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, access to health care, and cost). 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 4), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 2 May 2017), Embase (1980 to 2 May 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 2 May 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Community‐based randomised controlled, cluster‐randomised, or quasi‐randomised controlled trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE method and prepared 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We included in this review 33 original trials (reported in 62 separate articles), which were conducted across Africa and Central and South America, with most reported from Asia, specifically India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Of the 33 community educational interventions provided, 16 included family members in educational counselling, most frequently the mother‐in‐law or the expectant father. Most studies (n = 14) required one‐to‐one counselling between a healthcare worker and a mother, and 12 interventions involved group counselling for mothers and occasionally family members; the remaining seven incorporated components of both counselling methods. 
Our analyses show that community health educational interventions had a significant impact on reducing overall neonatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.96; random‐effects model; 26 studies; n = 553,111; I² = 88%; very low‐quality evidence), early neonatal mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.84; random‐effects model; 15 studies that included 3 subsets from 3 studies; n = 321,588; I² = 86%; very low‐quality evidence), late neonatal mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74; random‐effects model; 11 studies; n = 186,643; I² = 88%; very low‐quality evidence), and perinatal mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91; random‐effects model; 15 studies; n = 262,613; I² = 81%; very low‐quality evidence). Moreover, community health educational interventions increased utilisation of any antenatal care (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.22; random‐effects model; 18 studies; n = 307,528; I² = 96%) and initiation of breastfeeding (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.77; random‐effects model; 19 studies; n = 126,375; I² = 99%). In contrast, community health educational interventions were found to have a non‐significant impact on use of modern contraceptives (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.41; random‐effects model; 3 studies; n = 22,237; I² = 80%); presence of skilled birth attendance at birth (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.25; random‐effects model; 10 studies; n = 117,870; I² = 97%); utilisation of clean delivery kits (RR 4.44, 95% CI 0.71 to 27.76; random‐effects model; 2 studies; n = 17,087; I² = 98%); and care‐seeking (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27; random‐effects model; 7 studies; n = 46,154; I² = 93%).
