Background
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without MRI‐targeted biopsy, is an alternative test to systematic transrectal ultrasonography‐guided biopsy in men suspected of having prostate cancer. At present, evidence on which test to use is insufficient to inform detailed evidence‐based decision‐making. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests MRI only, MRI‐targeted biopsy, the MRI pathway (MRI with or without MRI‐targeted biopsy) and systematic biopsy as compared to template‐guided biopsy as the reference standard in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer as the target condition, defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 or higher. Secondary target conditions were the detection of grade 1 and grade 3 or higher‐grade prostate cancer, and a potential change in the number of biopsy procedures. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search up to 31 July 2018. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases and one trials register. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion any cross‐sectional study if it investigated one or more index tests verified by the reference standard, or if it investigated the agreement between the MRI pathway and systematic biopsy, both performed in the same men. We included only studies on men who were biopsy naïve or who previously had a negative biopsy (or a mix of both). Studies involving MRI had to report on both MRI‐positive and MRI‐negative men. All studies had to report on the primary target condition. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the QUADAS‐2 tool. To estimate test accuracy, we calculated sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate model. To estimate agreement between the MRI pathway and systematic biopsy, we synthesised detection ratios by performing random‐effects meta‐analyses. To estimate the proportions of participants with prostate cancer detected by only one of the index tests, we used random‐effects multinomial or binary logistic regression models. For the main comparisions, we assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
