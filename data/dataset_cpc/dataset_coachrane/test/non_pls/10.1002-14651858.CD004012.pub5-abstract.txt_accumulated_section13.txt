Background
People requiring long‐term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. Regimens involving different solutions can be used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage. This is an update of a review published in 2010. 
Objectives
To determine if certain washout regimens are better than others in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, complications, quality of life and critically appraise and summarise economic evidence for the management of long‐term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings to 23 May 2016. We also examined all reference lists of identified trials and contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing catheter washout policies (e.g. washout versus no washout, different washout solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration) in adults (aged 16 years and above) in any setting (i.e. hospital, nursing/residential home, community) with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter for more than 28 days. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were assessed and analysed as described in the Cochrane Handbook. If data in trials were not fully reported, clarification was sought from the study authors. For categorical outcomes, the numbers reporting an outcome were related to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR). For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations were used to derive mean differences (MD). 
Main results
We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies. Three were cross‐over and four were parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one parallel‐group RCT with 40 participants and one cross‐over RCT with 67 participants). Analyses of three cross‐over trials yielded suboptimal results because they were based on between‐group differences rather than individual participants' differences for sequential interventions. Two parallel‐group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and the other provided data for only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants in this study. 
The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures. None of the trials addressed: number of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes. Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. Two trials reported in more than one comparison group.
