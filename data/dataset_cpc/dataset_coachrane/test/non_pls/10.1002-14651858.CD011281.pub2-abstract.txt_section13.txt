No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate‐ (insulin lispro) to low‐quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low‐quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI ‐1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low‐quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD ‐1 h (95% CI ‐3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low‐quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid‐acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro‐treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin‐treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of ‐0.4 days (95% CI ‐1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low‐quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI ‐3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low‐quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.
