Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups.
