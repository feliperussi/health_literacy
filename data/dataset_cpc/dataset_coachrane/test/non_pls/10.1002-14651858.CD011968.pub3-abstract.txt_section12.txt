We included four trials (three RCTs and one cross‐over trial) involving 139 participants. Blinding of participants and physicians was well reported within all trials. We judged the overall risk of bias across trials as low. Only two trials (with 63 and 18 participants, respectively) provided sufficient information to be included in the meta‐analysis. We found no clear effect of rPMS on activities of daily living at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐16.35 to 10.35; P = 0.66; 1 trial; 63 participants; low‐quality evidence) and at the end of follow‐up (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐14.86 to 10.86; P = 0.76; 1 trial; 63 participants; low‐quality evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. We found no statistical difference in improvement of upper limb function at the end of treatment (MD 2.00, 95% CI ‐4.91 to 8.91; P = 0.57; 1 trial; 63 participants; low‐quality evidence) and at the end of follow‐up (MD 4.00, 95% CI ‐2.92 to 10.92; P = 0.26; 1 trial; 63 participants; low‐quality evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. We observed a significant decrease in spasticity of the elbow at the end of follow‐up (MD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.03; P = 0.03; 1 trial; 63 participants; low‐quality evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. In terms of muscle strength, rPMS treatment was not associated with improved muscle strength of the ankle dorsiflexors at the end of treatment (MD 3.00, 95% CI ‐2.44 to 8.44; P = 0.28; 1 trial; 18 participants; low‐quality evidence) when compared with sham rPMS. No studies provided information on lower limb function or adverse events, including death. Based on the GRADE approach, we judged the quality of evidence related to the primary outcome as low, owing to the small sample size of the studies.
