Background
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a fatal disease associated with rapidly progressive disability, for which no definitive treatment exists. Current treatment approaches largely focus on relieving symptoms to improve the quality of life of those affected. The therapeutic potential of cell‐based therapies in ALS/MND has not been fully evaluated, given the paucity of high‐quality clinical trials. Based on data from preclinical studies, cell‐based therapy is a promising treatment for ALS/MND. This review was first published in 2015 when the first clinical trials of cell‐based therapies were still in progress. We undertook this update to incorporate evidence now available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of cell‐based therapy for people with ALS/MND, compared with placebo or no treatment. 
Search methods
On 31 July 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that assigned people with ALS/MND to receive cell‐based therapy versus a placebo or no additional treatment. Co‐interventions were allowed, provided that they were given to each group equally. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
Two RCTs involving 112 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. One study compared autologous bone marrow‐mesenchymal stem cells (BM‐MSC) plus riluzole versus control (riluzole only), while the other study compared combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of autologous mesenchymal stem cells secreting neurotrophic factors (MSC‐NTF) to placebo. The latter study was reported as an abstract and provided no numerical data. Both studies were funded by biotechnology companies.
