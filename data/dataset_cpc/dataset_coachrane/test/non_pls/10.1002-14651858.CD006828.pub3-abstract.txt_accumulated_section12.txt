Background
POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M‐protein, and skin changes) syndrome is a rare cause of demyelinating and axonal mixed neuropathy with monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder and multiorgan involvement. The pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome is not well understood, but overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), probably secreted by plasmacytomas, is likely to be responsible for most of the characteristic symptoms. POEMS syndrome is a potentially fatal disease, and patients' quality of life deteriorates because of progressive neuropathy, massive pleural effusion or ascites, or thromboembolic events. There is a need for efficacious therapy to improve prognosis. This is the first update of a review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of treatment for POEMS syndrome.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (23 February 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012) and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to February 2012) for all papers on POEMS syndrome 
Selection criteria
We sought all randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials, and non‐randomized controlled studies. Since we discovered no such clinical trials, we assessed and summarized all retrospective case series including five or more patients in the 'Discussion' section. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted details of all potentially relevant trials with any treatment for POEMS syndrome. We then collated and summarized information on the outcome. 
Main results
We found no randomized or non‐randomized prospective controlled trials of treatment for POEMS syndrome. We summarized the results of retrospective case series containing five or more patients in the 'Discussion' section.
