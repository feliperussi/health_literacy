Background
Pimecrolimus was developed as an alternative to topical corticosteroids for treating eczema (atopic dermatitis) but its efficacy and safety compared with existing treatments remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of topical pimecrolimus for treating eczema.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to October 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (from 2003 to October 2006), and EMBASE (from 2005 to October 2006). We also contacted researchers and manufacturers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of 1.0% topical pimecrolimus used twice daily compared against other topical comparators for treating eczema. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility and extracted data for efficacy, tolerability and safety. A random‐effects model was used to estimate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). 
Main results
We included 31 trials (8019 participants) in the analysis. In short‐term (≤ 6 weeks) trials, pimecrolimus cream was significantly more effective and well‐tolerated than vehicle (cream base, but not containing pimecrolimus). In long‐term trials (≥ 6 months), pimecrolimus was significantly better than vehicle in preventing flares (9 trials, 3091 participants, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.64 at six months) and in improving quality of life.   Pimecrolimus was significantly less effective than two topical corticosteroids, i.e. 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide for investigators' global assessment (1 trial, 658 participants, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and 0.1% betamethasone valerate for participants' global assessment (1 trial, 87 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81) at three weeks. Pimecrolimus was also associated with significantly more overall withdrawals and skin burning. None of the trials reported on key adverse effects such as thinning of skin.
