Background
Acute diarrhoea is a leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Most deaths are caused by excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Racecadotril is an anti‐secretory drug that has been used for acute diarrhoea in children as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta‐analysis and used a random‐effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
