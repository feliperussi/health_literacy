Background
The prevalence of children diagnosed with thrombotic events has been increasing in the last decades. The most common thrombosis risk factor in neonates, infants and children is the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC). It is unknown if anticoagulation prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) decreases CVC‐related thrombosis in children. This is an update of the Cochrane Review published in 2014. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of LMWH prophylaxis on the incidence of CVC‐related thrombosis and major and minor bleeding complications in children. Further objectives were to determine the effect of LMWH on occlusion of CVCs, number of days of CVC patency, episodes of catheter‐related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), other side effects of LMWH (allergic reactions, abnormal coagulation profile, heparin‐induced thrombocytopaenia and osteoporosis) and mortality during therapy. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 7 May 2019. We undertook reference checking of identified trials to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials comparing LMWH to no prophylaxis (placebo or no treatment), or low‐dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) either as continuous infusion or flushes (low‐dose UFH aims to ensure the patency of the central line but has no systemic anticoagulation activity), given to prevent CVC‐related thrombotic events in children. We selected studies conducted in children aged 0 to 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified eligible studies, which were assessed for study methodology including bias, and extracted unadjusted data where available. In the data analysis step, all outcomes were analysed as binary or dichotomous outcomes. The effects of interventions were summarised with risk ratios (RR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.
