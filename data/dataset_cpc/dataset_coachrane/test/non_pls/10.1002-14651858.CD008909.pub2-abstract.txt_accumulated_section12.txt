Background
Anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) are the most prevalent regimens in the management of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL). However, there is no proof that they are superior to non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACR). 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy of ACRs to other chemotherapy regimens, in the treatment of FL. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), smaller databases, relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012) and the National Medical Library (April 2013). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACR with non‐ACR for adult patients with FL. We excluded trials in which immunotherapy, radiotherapy alone or stem‐cell transplantation were used in one arm alone. Our primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included disease control, as measured by progression‐free survival (PFS) or remission duration (RD). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We analyzed trials separately according to resemblance of the chemotherapeutic regimens in study arms, other than the addition of anthracyclines ('same' versus 'different' chemotherapy). Hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
Eight RCTs, conducted between 1974 and 2011, and involving 2636 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. All trials included therapy‐naive patients. Rituximab was used in one trial only. Follow‐up was between three and five years in most trials (range three to 18 years). All trials were published in peer‐reviewed journals.
