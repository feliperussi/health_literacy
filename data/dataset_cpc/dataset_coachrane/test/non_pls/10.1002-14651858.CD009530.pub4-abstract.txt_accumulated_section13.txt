Background
Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections are the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. When sputum samples are unavailable, treatment relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns regarding the sensitivity of these to identify lower respiratory organisms. 
Bronchoscopy and related procedures (including bronchoalveolar lavage) though invasive, allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non‐sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may help in a more accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and guide the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. 
This is an update of a previous review.
Objectives
To evaluate the use of bronchoscopy‐guided antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 30 August 2018. 
We also searched three registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 10 April 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled studies including people of any age with cystic fibrosis, comparing outcomes following therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (and related procedures) with outcomes following therapies guided by the results of any other type of sampling (including cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.
