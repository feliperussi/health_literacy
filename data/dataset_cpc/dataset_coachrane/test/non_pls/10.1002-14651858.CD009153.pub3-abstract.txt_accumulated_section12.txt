Background
Antiretroviral drugs have been shown to reduce risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and are also widely used for post‐exposure prophylaxis for parenteral and sexual exposures. Sexual transmission may be lower in couples in which one partner is infected with HIV and the other is not and the infected partner is on antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Objectives
To determine if ART use in an HIV‐infected member of an HIV‐discordant couple is associated with lower risk of HIV transmission to the uninfected partner compared to untreated discordant couples. 
Search methods
We used standard Cochrane methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCT), cohort studies and case‐control studies of HIV‐discordant couples in which the HIV‐infected member of the couple was being treated or not treated with ART 
Data collection and analysis
Abstracts of all trials identified by electronic or bibliographic scanning were examined independently by two authors. We initially identified 3,833 references and examined 87 in detail for study eligibility. Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form. 
Main results
One RCT and nine observational studies were included in the review. These ten studies identified 2,112 episodes of HIV transmission, 1,016 among treated couples and 1,096 among untreated couples. The rate ratio for the single randomised controlled trial was 0.04 [95% CI 0.00, 0.27]. All index partners in this study had CD4 cell counts at baseline of 350‐550 cells/µL. Similarly, the summary rate ratio for the nine observational studies was 0.58 [95% CI 0.35, 0.96], with substantial heterogeneity (I2=64%). After excluding two studies with inadequate person‐time data, we estimated a summary rate ratio of 0.36 [95% CI 0.17, 0.75] with substantial heterogeneity (I2=62%). We also performed subgroup analyses among the observational studies to see if the effect of ART on prevention of HIV differed by the index partner's CD4 cell count. Among couples in which the infected partner had ≥350 CD4 cells/µL, we estimated a rate ratio of 0.12 [95% CI 0.01, 1.99]. In this subgroup, there were 247 transmissions in untreated couples and 30 in treated couples.
