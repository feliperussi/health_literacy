Background
Plasma volume is reduced amongst women with pre‐eclampsia. This association has led to the suggestion that expanding the plasma volume might improve maternal and uteroplacental circulation, and so potentially improve outcome for both the woman and her baby. 
Objectives
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of plasma volume expansion for the treatment of women with pre‐eclampsia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Issue 4, 2000 were searched for trials meeting the selection criteria. 
We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 1 October 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials were included. Quasi‐random designs were excluded. Participants were women with hypertension during pregnancy, with or without proteinuria. Women who were postpartum at trial entry were excluded. Interventions were any comparison of plasma volume expansion with no expansion, or of one plasma volume expander with another. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship or results. 
Main results
Three trials involving 61 women were included in this review. All compared a colloid solution with no plasma volume expansion. For every outcome reported, the confidence intervals are very wide and cross the no effect line. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for any reliable estimates of the effects of plasma volume expansion for women with pre‐eclampsia.
