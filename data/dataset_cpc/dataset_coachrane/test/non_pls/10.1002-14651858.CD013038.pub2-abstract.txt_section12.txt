Three trials involving a total of 161 preterm infants were included in this review, but only two trials (131 infants) contributed data for meta‐analysis. There was no evidence of a clear effect of exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feedings on time taken to reach full sucking feeds (MD ‐2.57 days, 95% CI ‐5.15 to 0.02; I2 = 17%; 2 trials, 131 infants; very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported no adverse effects. There was no evidence of a clear effect of exposure to the smell and taste of milk on the following outcomes: time taken to reach full enteral feeds (MD ‐1.57 days, 95% CI ‐6.25 to 3.11; 1 trial, 51 infants; very low‐quality evidence), duration of parenteral nutrition (MD ‐2.20 days, 95% CI ‐9.49 to 5.09; 1 trial, 51 infants; very low‐quality evidence), incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.48; 1 trial, 51 infants; low‐quality evidence), and late infection (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 22.13; 1 trial, 51 infants; low‐quality evidence). There was very low‐quality evidence demonstrating that exposure to the smell and taste of milk decreased duration of hospitalisation by almost four days (MD ‐3.89 days, 95% CI ‐7.03 to ‐0.75; I2 = 51%; 2 trials, 131 infants). In two trials, an increased growth velocity was noted in infants exposed to the intervention, but we were unable to combine data to perform meta‐analysis. No data were available to assess feed intolerance and rates of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge. Included trials were small and had methodological limitations including lack of randomisation (one trial), lack of blinding, and different inclusion criteria and administration of the interventions.
