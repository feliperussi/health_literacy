Background
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest skin cancer in the white population. It is traditionally treated by surgical excision (SE) or by Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).   
Objectives
The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness, cost, complications and acceptability of periocular BCCs when operated by MMS or SE. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 February 2014. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SE with MMS for treatment of periocular BCC. 
Data collection and analysis
We did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Main results
We did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review and hence none were included for analysis. Results of non‐randomised studies describing the individual techniques are reported. 
Authors' conclusions
No reliable conclusions could be reached regarding which method of treatment (SE or MMS) resulted in a lower recurrence or complication rate for periocular BCC. No studies were found comparing the cost of either method directly.    
High quality RCTs are therefore needed to improve the evidence base for the management of this condition.
