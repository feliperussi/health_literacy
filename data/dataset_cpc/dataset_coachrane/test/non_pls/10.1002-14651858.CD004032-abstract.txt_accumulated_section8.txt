Background
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the application of an electrical current through electrodes attached to the skin. The commonest clinical application of TENS is pain control. TENS is also used occasionally for the treatment of a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions including drug and alcohol dependence, headaches, and depression. TENS is rarely used for the treatment of dementia. However, since the early 1990s a number of studies carried out by a group in the Netherlands, and one study carried out by a group in Japan, suggest that TENS applied to the back or head may improve cognition and behaviour in patients with Alzheimer's disease or multi‚Äêinfarct dementia. It was claimed that applying TENS could benefit patients with dementia by altering the activity of various neurotransmitters, or by increasing brain activity and thereby retarding neural degeneration and stimulating regenerative processes. It is claimed that application of TENS to the head may also alleviate the sleep disorders associated with dementia. 
Objectives
The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the treatment of dementia. Secondary objectives of this review are to determine whether any effect of treatment of dementia with TENS is influenced by any treatment parameters or patient features, including: the duration of treatment, electrical waveform, current amplitude, pulse duration and frequency and the patient's type or severity of cognitive impairment. 
Search methods
The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 5 December 2005 using the terms TENS, transcutaneous, "transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation", "electric stimulation", or "cranial electrostimulation" or "cranial stimulation". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated. 
Selection criteria
All RCTs in which TENS was used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in this review. This included peripherally applied transcutaneous electrical stimulation as well as transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied to the head (also known as cranial electrical stimulation (CES)).
