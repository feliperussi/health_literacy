Background
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in childhood and febrile neutropenia is a potentially life‐threatening side effect of its treatment. Current treatment consists of supportive care plus antibiotics. Clinical trials have attempted to evaluate the use of colony‐stimulating factors (CSF) as additional therapy to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL. Individual trials have not demonstrated significant benefit. Systematic reviews provide the most reliable assessment and the best recommendations for practice. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the addition of granulocyte colony‐stimulating factors (G‐CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factors (GM‐CSF) to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in children with ALL in an effort to prevent the development of febrile neutropenia. Evaluation of number of febrile neutropenia episodes, length to neutrophil count recovery, incidence and length of hospitalisation, number of infectious disease episodes, incidence and length of treatment delays, side effects (flu‐like syndrome, bone pain and allergic reaction), relapse and overall mortality (death). 
Search methods
The search covered the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, LILACS, and SciElo. We manually searched records of conference proceedings of ASCO and ASH from 1985 to 2003 and used the electronic databases of the ASCO and ASH web sites to search for abstracts from 2003 to September 2008, as well as databases of ongoing trials. We consulted experts and scanned references from the relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CSF with placebo or no treatment as primary or secondary prophylaxis to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL.
