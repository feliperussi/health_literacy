Background
Healthcare professionals frequently advise people to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. 
Objectives
The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation, and to determine the effect of anti‐smoking advice on disease‐specific and all‐cause mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in January 2013 for trials of interventions involving physicians. We also searched Latin American databases through BVS (Virtual Library in Health) in February 2013. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomisation and completeness of follow‐up. 
The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow‐up. We also considered the effect of advice on mortality where long‐term follow‐up data were available. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. People lost to follow‐up were counted as smokers. Effects were expressed as relative risks. Where possible, we performed meta‐analysis using a Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect model.
