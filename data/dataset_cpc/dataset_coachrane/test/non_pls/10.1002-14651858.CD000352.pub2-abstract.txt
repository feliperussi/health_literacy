Background
Observational studies of increasingly better quality and in different settings suggest that planned home birth in many places can be as safe as planned hospital birth and with less intervention and fewer complications. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1998. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of planned hospital birth compared with planned home birth in selected low‐risk women, assisted by an experienced midwife with collaborative medical back up in case transfer should be necessary. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2012) and contacted editors and authors involved with possible trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing planned hospital birth with planned home birth in low‐risk women as described in the objectives. 
Data collection and analysis
The two review authors as independently as possible assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
Two trials met the inclusion criteria but only one trial involving 11 women provided some outcome data and was included. The evidence from this trial was of moderate quality and too small to allow conclusions to be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no strong evidence from randomised trials to favour either planned hospital birth or planned home birth for low‐risk pregnant women. However, the trials show that women living in areas where they are not well informed about home birth may welcome ethically well‐designed trials that would ensure an informed choice. As the quality of evidence in favour of home birth from observational studies seems to be steadily increasing, it might be as important to prepare a regularly updated systematic review including observational studies as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as to attempt to set up new randomised controlled trials.
