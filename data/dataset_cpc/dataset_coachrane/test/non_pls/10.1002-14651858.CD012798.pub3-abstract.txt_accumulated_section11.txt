Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.
