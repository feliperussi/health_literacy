Background
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalised patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances, outcomes have not substantially changed in the last four decades. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has shown promise in animal studies, however randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown inconsistent clinical benefits. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of ANP for preventing and treating AKI.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and reference lists of retrieved articles.
Selection criteria
RCTs that investigated all forms of ANP versus any other treatment in adult hospitalised patients with or “at risk” of AKI. 
Data collection and analysis
Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean difference (MD). Outcomes were analysed separately for low and high dose ANP for preventing or treating AKI. 
Main results
Nineteen studies (11 prevention, 8 treatment; 1,861 participants) were included. There was no difference in mortality between ANP and control in either the low or high dose prevention studies. Low (but not high) dose ANP was associated with a reduced need for RRT in the prevention studies (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.71). Length of hospital and ICU stay were significantly shorter in the low dose ANP group. For established AKI, there was no difference in mortality with either low or high dose ANP. Low (but not high) dose ANP was associated with a reduction in the need for RRT (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.98). High dose ANP was associated with more adverse events (hypotension, arrhythmias). After major surgery there was a significant reduction in RRT requirement with ANP in the prevention studies (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.99), but not in the treatment studies. There was no difference in mortality between ANP and control in either the prevention or treatment studies. There was a reduced need for RRT with low dose ANP in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.70). ANP was not associated with outcome improvement in either radiocontrast nephropathy or oliguric AKI.
