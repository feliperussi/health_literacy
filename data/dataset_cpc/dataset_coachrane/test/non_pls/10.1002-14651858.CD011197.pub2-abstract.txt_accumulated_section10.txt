Background
Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation may benefit adults with atrial fibrillation or those who had been treated for atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is caused by multiple micro re‐entry circuits within the atrial tissue, which result in chaotic rapid activity in the atria. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of exercise‐based rehabilitation programmes, alone or with another intervention, compared with no‐exercise training controls in adults who currently have AF, or have been treated for AF. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases; CENTRAL and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, PsycINFO Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection Thomson Reuters, CINAHL EBSCO, LILACS Bireme, and three clinical trial registers on 14 July 2016. We also checked the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews identified by the searches. We imposed no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that investigated exercise‐based interventions compared with any type of no‐exercise control. We included trials that included adults aged 18 years or older with atrial fibrillation, or post‐treatment for atrial fibrillation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias using the domains outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, and by using standard Chi² and I² statistics. We performed meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect and random‐effects models; we used standardised mean differences where different scales were used for the same outcome. We assessed the risk of random errors with trial sequential analysis (TSA) and used the GRADE methodology to rate the quality of evidence, reporting it in the 'Summary of findings' table.
