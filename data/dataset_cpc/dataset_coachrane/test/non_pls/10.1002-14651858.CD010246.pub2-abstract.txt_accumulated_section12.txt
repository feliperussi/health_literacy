Background
Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death in children aged four to 18 years and are a major cause of ill health. The school setting offers the opportunity to deliver preventive interventions to a large number of children and has been used to address a range of public health problems. However, the effectiveness of the school setting for the prevention of different injury mechanisms in school‐aged children is not well understood. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of school‐based educational programmes for the prevention of injuries in children and evaluate their impact on improving children's safety skills, behaviour and practices, and knowledge, and assess their cost‐effectiveness. 
Search methods
We ran searches on the following electronic databases to 26 June 2015: PsycINFO, British Education Index (BEI), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Sociological Abstracts; Latin America and the Caribbean database (LILACS), together with several sources of grey literature. The Cochrane Injuries Information Specialist ran searches, to August 2013, on the Groups Specialised Register (SR‐INJ), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane Library databases, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the ISI Web of Science. In keeping with Cochrane standards, along with Cochrane Injuries' Information Specialist we ran an update search prior to publication (September and October 2016). We have screened the results and placed any relevant studies in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification section of this review.These will be incorporated in the next version of this review, as appropriate. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (non‐RCTs), and controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies that evaluated school‐based educational programmes aimed at preventing a range of injury mechanisms. The primary outcome was self‐reported or medically attended unintentional (or unspecified intent) injuries and secondary outcomes were observed safety skills, observed behaviour, self‐reported behaviour and safety practices, safety knowledge, and health economic outcomes. The control groups received no intervention, a delayed injury‐prevention intervention or alternative school‐based curricular activities. We included studies that aimed interventions at primary or secondary prevention of injuries from more than one injury mechanism and were delivered, in part or in full, in schools catering for children aged four to 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors identified relevant trials from title and abstracts of studies identified in searches and two review authors extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias. We grouped different types of interventions according to the outcome assessed and the injury mechanism targeted. Where data permitted, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses to provide a summary of results across studies. 
Main results
The review included 27 studies reported in 30 articles. The studies had 73,557 participants with 12 studies from the US; four from China; two from each of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the UK; and one from each of Israel, Greece and Brazil. Thirteen studies were RCTs, six were non‐RCTs and eight were CBAs. Of the included studies, 18 provided some element of the intervention in children aged four to 11 years, 17 studies included children aged 11 to 14 years and nine studies included children aged 14 to 18 years.
