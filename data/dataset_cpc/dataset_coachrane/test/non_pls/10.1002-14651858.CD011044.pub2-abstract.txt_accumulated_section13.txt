Background
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making when dealing with this difficult disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression‐free survival, grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life. 
Search methods
We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL (searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017. 
Selection criteria
All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently analysed studies, and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study. 
Main results
We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on radiotherapy. 
We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were outdated.
