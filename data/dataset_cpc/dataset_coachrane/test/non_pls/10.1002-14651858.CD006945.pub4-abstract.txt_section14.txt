One CCT evaluated the primary outcome; no clear evidence of a difference was identified between the treatment and the control groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33; P = 0.34). Pooled results of three CCTs showed significantly lower mortality due to TLS in the treatment group (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; P = 0.04); no clear evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality was identified between the groups (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.42; P = 0.26). Pooled results from five CCTs showed significantly lower incidence of renal failure in the treatment group (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.89; P = 0.03). Results of CCTs also showed significantly lower uric acid in the treatment group at two days (three CCTs: MD ‐3.80 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐7.37 mg/dL to ‐0.24 mg/dL; P = 0.04), three days (two CCTs: MD ‐3.13 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐6.12 mg/dL to ‐0.14 mg/dL; P = 0.04), four days (two CCTs: MD ‐4.60 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐6.39 mg/dL to ‐2.81 mg/dL; P < 0.00001), and seven days (one CCT: MD ‐1.74 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐3.01 mg/dL to ‐0.47 mg/dL; P = 0.007) after therapy, but not one day (three CCTs: MD ‐3.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐7.61 mg/dL to 1.60 mg/dL; P = 0.2), five days (one CCT: MD ‐1.02 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐2.24 mg/dL to 0.20 mg/dL; P = 0.1), and 12 days (one CCT: MD ‐0.80 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐2.51 mg/dL to 0.91 mg/dL; P = 0.36) after therapy. Pooled results from three CCTs showed higher frequency of adverse effects in participants who received urate oxidase (RR 9.10, 95% CI 1.29 to 64.00; P = 0.03).
