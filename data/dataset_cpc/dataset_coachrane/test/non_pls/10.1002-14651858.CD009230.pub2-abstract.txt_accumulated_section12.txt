Background
Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between any other antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. This review examined the effects of the high‐potency antipsychotic fluphenazine compared to those of low‐potency antipsychotics. 
Objectives
To review the effects of fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2010).
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. 
Main results
The review currently includes seven randomised trials and 1567 participants that compared fluphenazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 40 and 438 participants. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. Fluphenazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (fluphenazine 55%, low‐potency drug 55%, 2 RCTs, n = 105, RR 1.06 CI 0.75 to 1.50, moderate quality evidence). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal numbers of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (fluphenazine 36%, low‐potency antipsychotics 36%, 6 RCTs, n = 1532, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.14, moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for numbers experiencing at least one adverse effect (fluphenazine 70%, low‐potency antipsychotics 88%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.79 CI 0.58 to 1.07, moderate quality evidence). However, at least one movement disorder occurred significantly more frequently in the fluphenazine group (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 3 RCTs, n = 971, RR 2.11 CI 1.41 to 3.15, low quality of evidence). In contrast, low‐potency antipsychotics produced significantly more sedation (fluphenazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 64%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.31 CI 0.13 to 0.77, high quality evidence). No data were available for the outcomes of death and quality of life. The results of the primary outcome were robust in a number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
