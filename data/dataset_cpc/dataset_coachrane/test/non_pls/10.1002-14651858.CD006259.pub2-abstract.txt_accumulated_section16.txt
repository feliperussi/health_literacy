Background
Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy). Antimetabolites are used during surgery to reduce postoperative scarring during wound healing. Two agents in common use are mitomycin C (MMC) and 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of MMC compared to 5‐FU as an antimetabolite adjunct in trabeculectomy surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials where wound healing had been modified with MMC compared to 5‐FU. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials and collected data. The primary outcome was failure of a functioning trabeculectomy one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included mean intraocular pressure at one year. We considered three subgroups: high risk of trabeculectomy failure (people with previous glaucoma surgery, extracapsular cataract surgery, African origin and people with secondary glaucoma or congenital glaucoma); medium risk of trabeculectomy failure (people undergoing trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract surgery) and low risk of trabeculectomy failure (people who have received no previous surgical eye intervention). 
Main results
We identified 11 trials that enrolled 687 eyes of 679 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias in all domains. 
The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was less in those participants who received MMC compared to those who received 5‐FU, however the confidence intervals were wide and are compatible with no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I2 = 40%). There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69). 
On average, people treated with MMC had lower intraocular pressure at one year (mean difference (MD) ‐3.05 mmHg, 95% CI ‐4.60 to ‐1.50), but the studies were inconsistent (I2 = 52%). The size of the effect was greater in the high‐risk group (MD ‐4.18 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.73 to ‐1.64) compared to the low‐risk group (MD ‐1.72 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.16), but again the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). 
Similar proportions of eyes treated with MMC lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery compared to 5‐FU, but the confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06).
