Primary outcome: we found moderate‐quality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a post‐hospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.15 to 0.15)). We found low‐quality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and in‐person physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies with 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and in‐person rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI ‐0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderate‐quality evidence that there was no difference between those who received post‐discharge support interventions and those who received usual care on health‐related quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderate‐quality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing post‐discharge tele‐support programs with usual care (SMD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI ‐2.17 to 4.64, low‐quality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to in‐person therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trial‐related adverse events were reported.
