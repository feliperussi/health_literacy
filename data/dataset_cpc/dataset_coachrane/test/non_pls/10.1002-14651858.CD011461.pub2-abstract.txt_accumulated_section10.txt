Background
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. Complete resection of the whole tumor remains the only approach to treat this malignant disease. Since gastric cancer is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, many people are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is inoperable. In addition, because other conventional treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) have only modest efficacy for those with advanced/metastatic gastric cancer, the prognosis in such cases is poor. Recently, trials have provided some promising results regarding molecular‐targeted therapy, raising the possibility that the development of these agents could be a fruitful approach. However, the benefit of molecular‐targeted therapy for advanced gastric cancer remains inconclusive. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of molecular‐targeted therapy , either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in people with advanced gastric cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases (from inception to December 2015): the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (aged 18 years or older) with histologically‐confirmed advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach/gastro‐esophageal junction. Trials of participants with esophageal adenocarcinoma were also considered to be eligible. The eligible trials should aim to evaluate the effects of molecular‐targeted agents on participants' prognosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed selection of eligible trials, assessment of trial quality, and data extraction. We used methods of survival analysis and expressed the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR) when pooling time‐to‐event data, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
