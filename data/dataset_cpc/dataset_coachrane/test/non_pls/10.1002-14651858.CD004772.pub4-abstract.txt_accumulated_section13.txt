Background
In the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), over 50% of HIV‐infected infants progress to AIDS and death by 2 years of age. However, there are challenges to initiation of ART in early life, including the possibility of drug resistance in the context of prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission (PMTCT) programs, a paucity of drug choices , uncertain dosing for some medications and long‐term toxicities. Key management decisions include when to start ART, what regimen to start, and whether and when to substitute drugs or interrupt therapy. This review, an update of a previous review, aims to summarize the currently available evidence on this topic and inform the ART management in HIV‐infected children less than 3 years of age. 
Objectives
To evaluate 1) when to start ART in young children (less than 3 years); 2) what ART to start with, comparing first‐line non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI)‐based regimens; and 3) whether alternative strategies should be used to optimize antiretroviral treatment in this population: induction (initiation with 4 drugs rather than 3 drugs) followed by maintenance ART, interruption of ART and substitution of PI with NNRTI drugs once virological suppression is achieved on a PI‐based regimen. 
Search methods
Search methods
We searched for published studies in the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, Pubmed, EMBASE and CENTRAL. We screened abstracts from relevant conference proceedings and searched for unpublished and ongoing trials in clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). 
Selection criteria
We identified RCTs that recruited perinatally HIV‐infected children under 3 years of age without restriction of setting. We rejected trials that did not include children less than 3 years of age, did not provide stratified outcomes for those less than 3 years or did not evaluate either timing of ART initiation, choice of drug regimen or treatment switch/interruption strategy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently applied study selection criteria, assessed study quality and extracted data. Effects were assessed using the hazard ratio (HR) for time‐to‐event outcomes, relative risk for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
A search of the databases identified a total of 735 unique, previously unreviewed studies, of which 731 were excluded to leave 4 new studies to incorporate into the review. Four additional studies were identified in conference proceedings, for a total of 8 studies addressing when to start treatment (n=2), what to start (n=3), whether to substitute lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with nevirapine (NVP) (n=1), whether to use an induction‐maintenance ART strategy (n=1) and whether to interrupt treatment (n=1).
