Background
In children, functional daytime urinary incontinence is the term used to describe any leakage of urine while awake that is not the result of a known underlying neurological or congenital anatomic cause (such as conditions or injuries that affect the nerves that control the bladder or problems with the way the urinary system is formed). It can result in practical difficulties for both the child and their family and can have detrimental effects on a child’s well‐being, education and social engagement. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of conservative interventions for treating functional daytime urinary incontinence in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 September 2018). We also searched Chinese language bibliographic databases: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. No language restrictions were imposed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised, multi‐arm studies, cross‐over studies and cluster‐randomised studies that included children aged between 5 and 18 years with functional daytime urinary incontinence. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and determined the eligibility of studies for inclusion according to predefined criteria. Where data from the study were not provided, we contacted the study authors to request further information. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and processed included study data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where meta‐analysis was possible, we applied random‐effects meta‐analysis using the Mantel‐Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes.
