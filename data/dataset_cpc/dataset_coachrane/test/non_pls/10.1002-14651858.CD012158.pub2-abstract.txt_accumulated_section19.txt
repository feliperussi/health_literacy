Background
In the recent years, a variety of bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) procedures have emerged that may provide a treatment option to participants suffering from moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of BLVR on the short‐ and long‐term health outcomes in participants with moderate to severe COPD and determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of each individual technique. 
Search methods
Studies were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR) and by handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All searches are current until 07 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data, if available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Where possible, data from more than one study were combined in a meta‐analysis using RevMan 5 software. 
Main results
AeriSeal 
One RCT of 95 participants found that AeriSeal compared to control led to a significant median improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (18.9%, interquartile range (IQR) ‐0.7% to 41.9% versus 1.3%, IQR ‐8.2% to 12.9%), and higher quality of life, as measured by the St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (‐12 units, IQR ‐22 units to ‐5 units, versus ‐3 units, IQR ‐5 units to 1 units), P = 0.043 and P = 0.0072 respectively. Although there was no significant difference in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.90, 95% CI 0.14 to 62.15), adverse events were more common for participants treated with AeriSeal (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.34 to 10.24). The quality of evidence found in this prematurely terminated study was rated low to moderate. 
Airway bypass stents 
Treatment with airway bypass stents compared to control did not lead to significant between‐group changes in FEV1 (0.95%, 95% CI ‐0.16% to 2.06%) or SGRQ scores (‐2.00 units, 95% CI ‐5.58 units to 1.58 units), as found by one study comprising 315 participants. There was no significant difference in mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.77), nor were there significant differences in adverse events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.73) between the two groups. The quality of evidence was rated moderate to high. 
Endobronchial coils 
Three studies comprising 461 participants showed that treatment with endobronchial coils compared to control led to a significant between‐group mean difference in FEV1 (10.88%, 95% CI 5.20% to 16.55%) and SGRQ (‐9.14 units, 95% CI ‐11.59 units to ‐6.70 units). There were no significant differences in mortality (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.29), but adverse events were significantly more common for participants treated with coils (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.23). The quality of evidence ranged from low to high. 
Endobronchial valves 
Five studies comprising 703 participants found that endobronchial valves versus control led to significant improvements in FEV1 (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.64) and scores on the SGRQ (‐7.29 units, 95% CI ‐11.12 units to ‐3.45 units). There were no significant differences in mortality between the two groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.43) but adverse events were more common in the endobronchial valve group (OR 5.85, 95% CI 2.16 to 15.84). Participant selection plays an important role as absence of collateral ventilation was associated with superior clinically significant improvements in health outcomes. The quality of evidence ranged from low to high.
