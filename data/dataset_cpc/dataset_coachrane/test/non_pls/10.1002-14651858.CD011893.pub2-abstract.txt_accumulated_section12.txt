Background
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vision‐threatening disease of preterm neonates. The use of beta‐adrenergic blocking agents (beta‐blockers), which modulate the vasoproliferative retinal process, may reduce the progression of ROP or even reverse established ROP. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of beta‐blockers on short‐term structural outcomes, long‐term functional outcomes, and the need for additional treatment, when used either as prophylaxis in preterm infants without ROP, stage 1 ROP (zone I), or stage 2 ROP (zone II) without plus disease or as treatment in preterm infants with at least prethreshold ROP. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library Issue 7, 2017); Embase (January 1974 to 7 August 2017); PubMed (January 1966 to 7 August 2017); and CINAHL (January 1982 to 7 August 2017). We checked references and cross‐references and handsearched abstracts from the proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies Meetings. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion randomised or quasi‐randomised clinical trials that used beta‐blockers for prevention or treatment of ROP in preterm neonates of less than 37 weeks' gestational age. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included three randomised trials (N = 366) in this review. Two of these studies were at high risk of bias. All studies reported on prevention of ROP and compared oral propranolol with placebo or no treatment. We found no trials assessing beta‐blockers in infants with established stage 2 or higher ROP with plus disease.
