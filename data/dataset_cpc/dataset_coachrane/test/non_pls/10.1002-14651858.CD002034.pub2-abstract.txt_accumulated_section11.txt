Background
This is an update of the original review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 1, 2000 and updated in 2003, 2007 and 2010. 
People with a presumed high‐grade glioma (HGG) identified by clinical evaluation and radiological investigation have two initial surgical options: biopsy or resection. In certain situations, such as severe raised intracranial pressure, surgical resection is clinically indicated. Where surgical resection is not feasible, biopsy is the only reasonable option. Most people fall somewhere between these extremes, and in such circumstances it is uncertain which procedure is the best surgical option for the patient. Opinion is divided regarding the relative risks and benefits of each procedure. 
Objectives
To estimate the clinical effectiveness of surgical resection compared to biopsy in people with a new presumptive diagnosis of HGG. 
Search methods
We updated our searches of the following databases to 12 September 2018: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We also handsearched the Journal of Neuro‐Oncology and Neuro‐Oncology from 2010 to 2018 (including all conference abstracts). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people of all ages with a presumed diagnosis of HGG based upon clinical and radiological investigation. Interventions included any form of biopsy or resection. Surgery was at the time of initial presentation and not for recurrence. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviews authors independently assessed the search results for relevance and undertook critical appraisal according to prespecified guidelines. Outcome measures included survival, time to progression/progression‐free survival, quality of life, symptom control, adverse events, and mortality.
