Background
The use of insulin‐sensitising agents, such as metformin, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are undergoing ovulation induction or in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles has been widely studied. Metformin reduces hyperinsulinaemia and suppresses the excessive ovarian production of androgens. It is suggested that as a consequence metformin could improve assisted reproductive techniques (ART) outcomes, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), pregnancy, and live birth rates. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin as a co‐treatment during IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in achieving pregnancy or live birth in women with PCOS. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, the trial registries for ongoing trials, and reference lists of articles (from inception to 13 February 2020). 
Selection criteria
Types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing metformin treatment with placebo or no treatment in women with PCOS who underwent IVF or ICSI treatment. 
Types of participants: women of reproductive age with anovulation due to PCOS with or without co‐existing infertility factors. 
Types of interventions: metformin administered before and during IVF or ICSI treatment.
Primary outcome measures: live birth rate, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted the data according to the protocol, and assessed study quality. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This updated review includes 13 RCTs involving a total of 1132 women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatments. We stratified the analysis by type of ovarian stimulation protocol used (long gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonist (GnRH‐agonist) or short gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH‐antagonist)) to determine whether the type of stimulation used influenced the outcomes. We did not perform meta‐analysis on the overall (both ovarian stimulation protocols combined) data for the outcomes of live birth and clinical pregnancy rates per woman because of substantial heterogeneity.
