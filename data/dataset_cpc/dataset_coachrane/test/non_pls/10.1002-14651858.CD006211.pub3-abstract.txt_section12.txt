We included 29 trials recruiting 13,766 participants across nine, mostly high‐income countries. CGA increases the likelihood that patients will be alive and in their own homes at 3 to 12 months' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.10; 16 trials, 6799 participants; high‐certainty evidence), results in little or no difference in mortality at 3 to 12 months' follow‐up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.07; 21 trials, 10,023 participants; high‐certainty evidence), decreases the likelihood that patients will be admitted to a nursing home at 3 to 12 months follow‐up (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; 14 trials, 6285 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and results in little or no difference in dependence (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04; 14 trials, 6551 participants; high‐certainty evidence). CGA may make little or no difference to cognitive function (SMD ranged from ‐0.22 to 0.35 (5 trials, 3534 participants; low‐certainty evidence)). Mean length of stay ranged from 1.63 days to 40.7 days in the intervention group, and ranged from 1.8 days to 42.8 days in the comparison group. Healthcare costs per participant in the CGA group were on average GBP 234 (95% CI GBP ‐144 to GBP 605) higher than in the usual care group (17 trials, 5303 participants; low‐certainty evidence). CGA may lead to a slight increase in QALYs of 0.012 (95% CI ‐0.024 to 0.048) at GBP 19,802 per QALY gained (3 trials; low‐certainty evidence), a slight increase in LYs of 0.037 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.073), at GBP 6305 per LY gained (4 trials; low‐certainty evidence), and a slight increase in LYLAH of 0.019 (95% CI ‐0.019 to 0.155) at GBP 12,568 per LYLAH gained (2 trials; low‐certainty evidence). The probability that CGA would be cost‐effective at a GBP 20,000 ceiling ratio for QALY, LY, and LYLAH was 0.50, 0.89, and 0.47, respectively (17 trials, 5303 participants; low‐certainty evidence).
