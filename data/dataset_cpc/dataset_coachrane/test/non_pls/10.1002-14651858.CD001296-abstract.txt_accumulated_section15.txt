Background
Aspirin is widely prescribed for patients with a diagnosis of vascular dementia. In a survey of UK geriatricians and psychiatrists 80% of patients with clinical diagnoses of vascular dementia were prescribed aspirin. However, a number of queries remain unanswered. Is there convincing evidence that aspirin benefits patients with vascular dementia? Does aspirin affect cognition and behaviour, or improve prognosis? Does the risk of cerebral or gastric haemorrhage outweigh any benefit? 
Objectives
To assess the randomised trial evidence for efficacy and safety of aspirin in the treatment of vascular dementia. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 12 March 2012 using the terms: aspirin OR "acetylsalicylic acid". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. 
In addition, relevant websites were searched and some journals were handsearched. Specialists in the field were approached for unpublished material and any publications found were searched for additional references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of aspirin for vascular dementia were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Retrieved studies were analysed independently by both review authors. Methodology and results were critically appraised and outcomes scanned included cognition, behavioural change, mortality and institutionalisation. 
Main results
No trials were eligible for inclusion in this review.
Authors' conclusions
The most recent search for references to relevant research was carried out in March 2012. No trials were found for inclusion in this systematic review.
