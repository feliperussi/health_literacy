Background
The diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in patients with fever and a large spleen relies on showing Leishmania parasites in tissue samples and on serological tests. Parasitological techniques are invasive, require sophisticated laboratories, consume time, or lack accuracy. Recently, rapid diagnostic tests that are easy to perform have become available. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for diagnosing VL in patients with suspected disease presenting at health services in endemic areas. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CIDG SR, CENTRAL, SCI‐expanded, Medion, Arif, CCT, and the WHO trials register on 3 December 2013, without applying language or date limits. 
Selection criteria
This review includes original, phase III, diagnostic accuracy studies of rapid tests in patients clinically suspected to have VL. As reference standards, we accepted: (1) direct smear or culture of spleen aspirate; (2) composite reference standard based on one or more of the following: parasitology, serology, or response to treatment; and (3) latent class analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality of included studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. We carried out a meta‐analysis to estimate sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests, using a bivariate normal model with a complementary log‐log link function. We analysed each index test separately. As possible sources of heterogeneity, we explored: geographical area, commercial brand of index test, type of reference standard, disease prevalence, study size, and risk of bias (QUADAS‐2). We also undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of imperfect reference standards.
