Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often experience difficulty with performing upper limb exercise due to dyspnoea and arm fatigue. Consequently, upper limb exercise training is typically incorporated in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes to improve upper limb exercise capacity; however, the effects of this training on dyspnoea and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) remain unclear. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of upper limb training (endurance or resistance training, or both) on symptoms of dyspnoea and HRQoL in people with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal from inception to 28 September 2016 as well as checking all reference lists of primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which upper limb exercise training of at least four weeks' duration was performed. Three comparisons were structured as: a) upper limb training only versus no training or sham intervention; b) combined upper limb training and lower limb training versus lower limb training alone; and c) upper limb training versus another type of upper limb training. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to provide missing data. We determined the treatment effect from each study as the post‐treatment scores. We were able to analyse data for all three planned comparisons. For the upper limb training only versus no training or sham intervention structure, the upper limb training was further classified as 'endurance training' or 'resistance training' to determine the impact of training modality. 
Main results
Fifteen studies on 425 participants were included in the review, one of which was in abstract form only. Twelve studies were included in the meta‐analysis across one or more of the three comparisons. The sample size of the included studies was small (12 to 43 participants) and overall study quality was moderate to low given the imprecision and risk of bias issues (i.e. missing information on sequence generation and allocation concealment as well as no blinding of outcome assessment and incomplete data). 
When upper limb training was compared to either no training or sham training, there was a small significant improvement in symptoms of dyspnoea with a mean difference (MD) of 0.37 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.72 points; data from four studies on 129 people). However, there was no significant improvement in dyspnoea when the studies of endurance training only (MD 0.41 points, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.95 points; data from two studies on 55 people) or resistance training only (MD 0.34 points, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.80 points; data from two studies on 74 people) were analysed. When upper limb training combined with lower limb training was compared to lower limb training alone, no significant difference in dyspnoea was shown (MD 0.36 points, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.76 points; data from three studies on 86 people). There were no studies which examined the effects on dyspnoea of upper limb training compared to another upper limb training intervention. 
There was no significant improvement in HRQoL when upper limb training was compared to either no training or sham training with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.05 (95% CI −0.31 to 0.40; four studies on 126 people) or when upper limb training combined with lower limb training was compared to lower limb training alone (SMD 0.01, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.43; three studies on 95 people). Only one study, in which endurance upper limb training was compared to resistance upper limb training, reported on HRQoL and showed no between‐group differences (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire MD 2.0 points, 95% CI −9 to 12; one study on 20 people).
