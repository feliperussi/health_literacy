Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder ‐ not otherwise specified (PDD‐NOS). Antipsychotics have been used as a medication intervention for irritability related to ASD. Aripiprazole, a third‐generation, atypical antipsychotic, is a relatively new drug that has a unique mechanism of action different from that of other antipsychotics. This review updates a previous Cochrane review on the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole for individuals with ASD, published in 2011 (Ching 2011). 
Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole as medication treatment for individuals with ASD. 
Search methods
In October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and seven other databases as well as two trial registers. We searched for records published in 1990 or later, as this was the year aripiprazole became available. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of aripiprazole (administered orally and at any dosage) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with a diagnosis of ASD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently collected, evaluated and analysed data. We performed meta‐analysis for primary and secondary outcomes, when possible. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included three trials in this review. Two were included in the previous published review, and the results of one, placebo‐controlled discontinuation study were added to this review. Although we searched for studies across age groups, we found only studies conducted in children and youth. Included trials had low risk of bias across most domains. High risk of bias was seen in only one trial with incomplete outcome data. We judged the overall quality of the evidence for most outcomes to be moderate.
