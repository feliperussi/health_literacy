Background
Intramedullary nailing is commonly used for treating fractures of the tibial shaft. These fractures are one of the most common long bone fractures in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of articles to December 2009. The search was subsequently updated to September 2011 to assess the more recent literature. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies evaluating different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults were included. Primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, patient‐reported function and re‐operation for treatment failure or complications. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data collection and extraction. 
Main results
Nine randomised and two quasi‐randomised clinical trials, involving a total of 2093 participants with 2123 fractures, were included. The evidence was dominated by one large multicentre trial of 1319 participants. Both quasi‐randomised trials were at high risk of selection bias. Otherwise, the trials were generally at low or unclear risk of bias. There were very few data on functional outcomes; and often incomplete data on re‐operations. The trials evaluated five different comparisons of interventions: reamed versus unreamed intramedullary nailing (six trials); Ender nail versus interlocking nail (two trials); expandable nail versus interlocking nail (one trial); interlocking nail with one distal screw versus with two distal screws (one trial); and closed nailing via the transtendinous approach versus the paratendinous approach (one trial).
