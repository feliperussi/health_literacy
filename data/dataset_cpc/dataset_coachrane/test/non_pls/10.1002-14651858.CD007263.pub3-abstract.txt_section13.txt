We included three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants in the review. The studies compared dilute (double‐volume, half‐strength) formula with full‐strength (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)) formula. We assessed all three studies as having unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial. Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies. We could combine two of the studies (88 infants) in the meta‐analysis. The evidence suggests that dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) may lead to fewer episodes of gastric residuals per day (one study; mean difference (MD) −1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.20 to −0.20; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of gastric residuals per baby until attaining 100 kcal/kg (one study; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.32 to −0.28; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of vomiting per day (one study; MD −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.01; low‐certainty evidence) and fewer occurrences of abdominal distension greater than 2 cm (two studies; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.19 to −0.13; low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, data suggest that infants in the dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) group may have attained an adequate energy intake earlier than infants in the full‐strength group (two studies; MD −2.26, 95% CI −2.85 to −1.67; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds (one study; MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.15; low‐certainty evidence). Data were not reported for length of hospital stay.
