Background
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is used to manage symptomatic gallstones. There is considerable controversy regarding whether it should be done as day‐surgery or as an overnight stay surgery with regards to patient safety. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of day‐surgery versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patient‐oriented outcomes such as mortality, severe adverse events, and quality of life. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and mRCT until September 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials comparing day‐surgery versus overnight stay surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, irrespective of language or publication status. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention‐to‐treat or available case analysis. 
Main results
We identified a total of six trials at high risk of bias involving 492 participants undergoing day‐case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 253) for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150. The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%. The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years. 
With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short‐term mortality. However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups. We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short‐term mortality in the remaining trials. Long‐term mortality was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day‐surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). There was no significant difference in quality of life between the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD ‐0.11; 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.10). 
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the secondary outcomes of our review: pain (3 trials; 175 participants; MD 0.02 cm visual analogue scale score; 95% CI ‐0.69 to 0.73); time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; MD ‐0.55 days; 95% CI ‐2.18 to 1.08); and return to work (1 trial, 74 participants; MD ‐2.00 days; 95% CI ‐10.34 to 6.34). No significant difference was seen in hospital readmission rate (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 (weighted rate 0.5%) in the day‐surgery group versus 5/239 (2.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group (rate ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63) or in the proportion of people requiring hospital readmissions (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (weighted proportion 3.5%) in the day‐surgery group versus 5/154 (3.2%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60). No significant difference was seen in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the two groups (5 trials; 419 participants; 42/205 (weighted proportion 19.3%) in the day‐surgery group versus 43/214 (20.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41). For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity‐adjusted required information size to exclude random errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Day‐surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Day‐surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient‐oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The randomised clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of day‐surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the quality of life as well as other outcomes of patients.
