Background
Heartburn is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in pregnant women. It can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy. The symptoms of heartburn in pregnancy may be frequent, severe and distressing, but serious complications are rare. Many interventions have been used for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. These interventions include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications. However, there has been no evidence‐based recommendation for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for relieving heartburn in pregnancy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2015), Asian & Oceanic Congress of Obstetrics & Gynaecology (AOCOG) conference proceedings (20‐23 October 2013, Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTS of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy compared with another intervention, or placebo, or no intervention. Cluster‐RCTs would have been eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies available as abstracts only and those using a cross‐over design. 
Interventions could include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications (such as antacids, sucralfate, histamine 2‐receptor antagonists, promotility drugs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs involving 725 women. However, five trials did not contribute data. Four trials involving 358 women contributed data. Trials were generally at mixed risk of bias. 
We only identified data for three comparisons: pharmaceutical treatment versus placebo or no treatment; acupuncture versus no treatment and pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle changes.
