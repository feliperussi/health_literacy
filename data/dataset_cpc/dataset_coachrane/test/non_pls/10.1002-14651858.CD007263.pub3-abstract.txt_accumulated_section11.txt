Background
Preterm infants have fewer nutrient reserves at birth than full‐term infants and often receive artificial formula feeds in the absence of expressed breast milk. Although it is generally agreed that feeding must be initiated slowly and advanced with much greater deliberation than in a healthy, full‐term infant, the way in which feeds are introduced and advanced in preterm infants varies widely. This review focuses on whether dilute or full‐strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants for whom expressed breast milk is unavailable. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dilute versus full‐strength formula on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, feeding intolerance, weight gain, length of stay in hospital and time to achieve full calorie intake in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 October 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 October 2018). 
We searched clinical trials' registries for ongoing or recently completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organization’s International Trials Registry and Platform; and the ISRCTN Registry). 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing strengths of formula milk in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. We excluded studies if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently assessed studies for inclusion. We collected data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with independent assessment of risk of bias and data extraction. We synthesised mean differences using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
