Seventy‐four studies enrolling 7049 infants were included. Results from only a few studies could be combined in meta‐analyses and for most analyses the GRADE assessments indicated low‐ or moderate‐quality evidence. There was high‐quality evidence for the beneficial effect of sucrose (24%) with non‐nutritive sucking (pacifier dipped in sucrose) or 0.5 mL of sucrose orally in preterm and term infants: Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) 30 s after heel lance WMD ‐1.70 (95% CI ‐2.13 to ‐1.26; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity); 3 studies, n = 278); PIPP 60 s after heel lance WMD ‐2.14 (95% CI ‐3.34 to ‐0.94; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 studies, n = 164). There was high‐quality evidence for the use of 2 mL 24% sucrose prior to venipuncture: PIPP during venipuncture WMD ‐2.79 (95% CI ‐3.76 to ‐1.83; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 groups in 1 study, n = 213); and intramuscular injections: PIPP during intramuscular injection WMD ‐1.05 (95% CI ‐1.98 to ‐0.12; I2 = 0% (2 groups in 1 study, n = 232). Evidence from studies that could not be included in RevMan‐analyses supported these findings. Reported adverse effects were minor and similar in the sucrose and control groups. Sucrose is not effective in reducing pain from circumcision. The effectiveness of sucrose for reducing pain/stress from other interventions such as arterial puncture, subcutaneous injection, insertion of nasogastric or orogastric tubes, bladder catherization, eye examinations and echocardiography examinations are inconclusive. Most trials indicated some benefit of sucrose use but that the evidence for other painful procedures is of lower quality as it is based on few studies of small sample sizes. The effects of sucrose on long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes are unknown.
