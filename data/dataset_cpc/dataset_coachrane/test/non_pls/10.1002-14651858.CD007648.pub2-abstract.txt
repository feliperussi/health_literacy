Background
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of falls due to impairments in lower‐extremity joints, which may result in either mobility, or postural stability problems. There is evidence in the literature suggesting that balance, agility and coordination training techniques can induce changes in lower‐extremity muscle activity patterns that result in improvement in dynamic joint stability. 
The mechanoreceptors present in and around the joints are responsible for maintaining postural control and joint position sense. These receptors are integrated to compose the somatosensorial system. In combination with visual and auditory inputs, which improve our spatial perception even further, the systems are able to maintain a stable body posture. 
However, there is a lack of information on the efficacy of balance training alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of balance training (proprioceptive training) to improve functional capacity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (January 1966 to December 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2008), LILACS (January 1982 to December 2008), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2008), PEDro and Scirus (inception to 2008). We also handsearched conference abstracts. 
Selection criteria
All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) comparing balance training (proprioceptive training) with any other intervention or with no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed titles or abstracts, or both, for inclusion criteria. 
Main results
The electronic search identified 864 studies. From this search, 17 studies described general exercises in rheumatoid arthritis patients as the main topic.  After analysing them, we observed that the main interventions were exercises to improve muscle strength, endurance, and dynamic exercises (swimming, walking, etc). As we did not find any studies investigating the effects of balance training alone or in combination with other therapies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it was not possible to include any data regarding the chosen topic in this systematic review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no research available examining the efficacy of balance training alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The effectiveness and safety of balance training to improve functional capacity of these patients remains unclear. We suggest that future research should give more importance to balance training by either increasing the number and duration of sessions or investigating its efficacy alone.
