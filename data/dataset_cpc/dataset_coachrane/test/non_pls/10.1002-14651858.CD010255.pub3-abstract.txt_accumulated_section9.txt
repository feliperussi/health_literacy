Background
Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face‐to‐face or when added to usual care. 
Objectives
To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in‐person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face‐to‐face); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. 
Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self‐care and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, health‐related quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in‐person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost‐effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in‐person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in‐person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation.
