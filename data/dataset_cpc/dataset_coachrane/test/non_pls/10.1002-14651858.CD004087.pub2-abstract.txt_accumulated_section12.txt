Background
Several drugs have been used in attenuating or obliterating the response associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. These changes are of little concern in relatively healthy patients but can lead to morbidity and mortality in the high risk patient population. 
Objectives
The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in preventing the morbidity and mortality resulting from the haemodynamic changes in response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in adult patients aged 18 years and above who were undergoing elective surgery in the operating room setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2011), EMBASE (1980 to June 2011), and the bibliographies of published studies. We reran our search from June 2011 to December 2012 and will deal with these studies when we update the review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug used as an intervention for preventing or attenuating the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation to a control group, and that mentioned mortality, major morbidity, arrhythmia or electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of ischaemia in the methodology, results, or discussion section of the reports. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the outcome data.
Main results
We included 72 RCTs. The included trials studied the effects of 32 drugs belonging to different pharmacological groups. Only two trials mentioned the primary outcome of morbidity and mortality related to the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Of the secondary outcomes, 40 of the included trials observed arrhythmia only, 11 observed myocardial ischaemia only and 20 observed both arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia. Arrhythmias were observed in 2932 participants and myocardial ischaemia in 1616 participants. Arrhythmias were observed in 134 out of 993 patients in the control group compared to 80 out of 1939 in the intervention group. The risk of arrhythmias was significantly reduced with pharmacological interventions in the pooled data (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.19, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26, P < 0.00001, I2= 47%). Local anaesthetics, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and narcotics reduced the risk of arrhythmia in the intervention group compared to the control group. Myocardial ischaemia was observed in 21 out of 604 patients in the control group compared to 10 out of 1012 in the treatment group; the result was statistically significant (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92, P = 0.03, I2 = 19%). However, in subgroup analysis only local anaesthetics significantly reduced the ECG changes indicating ischaemia, but this evidence came from one study. The majority of the studies had a negative outcome. Hypotension and bradycardia were reported with 40 µg kg‐1 intravenous alfentanil, chest rigidity with 75 ug kg‐1 alfentanil, and increased bronchomotor tone with sympathetic blockers.
