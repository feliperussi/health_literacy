Background
Poorly controlled asthma and preventable exacerbations place a significant strain on healthcare, often requiring additional medications, hospital stays or treatment in the emergency department. 
Long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABA) are the preferred add‐on treatment for adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), but have important safety concerns in asthma. Long‐acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) have confirmed efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are now being considered as an alternative add‐on therapy for people with uncontrolled asthma. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of adding a LAMA to ICS compared with adding a LABA for adults whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR) from inception to April 2015, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. We searched additional resources to pick up unpublished studies, including ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization trials portal, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries. The most recent search was conducted in April 2015. 
Selection criteria
We searched for parallel and cross‐over RCTs in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled with ICS alone were randomised to receive LAMA add‐on or LABA add‐on for at least 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the electronic and additional searches and extracted data from study reports. We used Covidence for duplicate screening, extraction of study characteristics and numerical data, and risk of bias ratings. 
The pre‐specified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), quality of life and serious adverse events. 
Main results
We included eight studies meeting the inclusion criteria, but four double‐blind, double‐dummy studies of around 2000 people dominated the analyses. These four trials were between 14 and 24 weeks long, all comparing tiotropium (usually Respimat) with salmeterol on top of medium doses of ICS.
