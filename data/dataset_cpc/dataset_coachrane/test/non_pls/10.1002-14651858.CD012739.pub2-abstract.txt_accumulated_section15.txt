Background
Regular blood pressure (BP) measurement is crucial for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, such as pre‐eclampsia. BP can be measured in various settings, such as conventional clinics or self‐measurement at home, and with different techniques, such as using auscultatory or automated BP devices. It is important to understand the impact of different settings and techniques of BP measurement on important outcomes for pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of setting and technique of BP measurement for diagnosing hypertensive disorders in pregnancy on subsequent maternal and perinatal outcomes, women's quality of life, or use of health service resources. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 22 April 2020, and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pregnant women, using validated BP devices in different settings or using different techniques. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Of the 21 identified studies, we included three, and excluded 11; seven were ongoing. Of the three included RCTs (536,607 women), one was a cluster‐RCT, with a substantially higher number of participants (536,233 deliveries) than the other two trials, but did not provide data for most of our outcomes. We generally judged the included studies at low risk of bias, however, the certainty of the evidence was low, due to indirectness and imprecision. Meta‐analysis was not possible because each study investigated a different comparison. 
None of the included studies reported our primary outcome of systolic BP greater than or equal to 150 mmHg. None of the studies reported any of these important secondary outcomes: antenatal hospital admissions, neonatal unit length of stay, or neonatal endotracheal intubation and use of mechanical ventilation. 
Setting of BP measurement: self‐measurement versus conventional clinic measurement (one study, 154 women) 
There were no maternal deaths in either the self‐monitoring group or the usual care group. The study did not report perinatal mortality.
