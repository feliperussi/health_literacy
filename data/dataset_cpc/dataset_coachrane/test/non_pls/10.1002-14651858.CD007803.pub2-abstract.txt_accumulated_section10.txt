Background
A significant number of patients who suffer with anxiety and related disorders (that is post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (SAnD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD), specific phobia (SPh) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) fail to respond optimally to first‐line treatment with medication or cognitive and behavioural therapies. The addition of d‐cycloserine (DCS) to cognitive and behavioural therapies may improve treatment response by impacting the glutamatergic system. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of adding DCS to cognitive and behavioural therapies by synthesising data from relevant randomised controlled trials and following the guidelines recommended by Cochrane. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies compared to placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders. Additionally, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of DCS across different anxiety and related disorders. 
Search methods
This review fully incorporates studies identified from a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to 12 March 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date), the World Health Organization’s trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov . Reference lists from previous meta‐analyses and reports of RCTs were also checked. No restrictions were placed on language, setting, date or publication status. 
Selection criteria
All RCTs of DCS augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies versus placebo augmentation of cognitive and behavioural therapies for anxiety and related disorders were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors (RO and TA) independently assessed RCTs for eligibility and inclusion, extracted outcomes and risk of bias data and entered these into a customised extraction form. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. In addition, data entry and analysis were performed by two review authors (KSW and HB).
