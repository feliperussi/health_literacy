Background
Central venous catheters (CVCs) are a mainstay in the management of critically ill children. However, these catheters are associated with mechanical and infectious complications which reduce their life span. Heparin bonding of catheters has shown promise in animal studies and in adults. This is the first update of a review published in 2007. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to determine the effect of heparin‐bonded CVCs on the duration of catheter patency in children. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of heparin‐bonded catheters on catheter‐related thrombosis, occlusion, blood stream infection and side effects. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7). The authors searched MEDLINE (1946 to week 3 August 2013). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials of heparin‐bonded catheters versus non‐heparin bonded catheters or antibiotic‐impregnated catheters that reported on any of the prespecified outcomes, without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the information provided in the studies and by contacting authors. We extracted data and estimated the effect size reported as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) or number needed to treat (NNT), as appropriate. 
Main results
We included two eligible studies with a total of 287 participants; both had good methodological quality. There was no difference in the duration of catheter patency between heparin‐bonded and non‐heparin bonded catheters (median duration seven days versus six days) reported in one study. There was no difference in the risk of catheter‐related thrombosis (two studies, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.68; I2 = 80%; RD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.06). Data from one study revealed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.07; RD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.02; NNT 13, 95% CI 8 to 50), catheter‐related blood stream infections (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.41; RD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.25 to ‐0.10; NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 10) and catheter colonization (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; RD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.19 to ‐0.04; NNT 9, 95% CI 5 to 25) in the heparin‐bonded catheter group. The second study did not report on these outcomes. There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.39; RD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.07).
