Compared with attention control, self‐management programmes may not result in significant benefits at 12 months. Low‐quality evidence from one study (344 people) indicates that self‐management skills were similar in active and control groups: 5.8 points on a 10‐point self‐efficacy scale in the control group, and the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.4 points (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.39 to 1.19). Low‐quality evidence from four studies (575 people) indicates that self‐management programmes may lead to a small but clinically unimportant reduction in pain: the standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups was ‐0.26 (95% CI ‐0.44 to ‐0.09); pain was 6 points on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) in the control group, treatment resulted in a mean reduction of 0.8 points (95% CI ‐0.14 to ‐0.3) on a 10‐point scale, with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 5 to 23). Low‐quality evidence from one study (251 people) indicates that the mean global osteoarthritis score was 4.2 on a 0 to 10‐point symptom scale (lower better) in the control group, and treatment reduced symptoms by a mean of 0.14 points (95% CI ‐0.54 to 0.26). This result does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important benefit in some people (0.5 point reduction included in 95% CI). Low‐quality evidence from three studies (574 people) showed no signficant difference in function between groups (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 0.11); mean function was 1.29 points on a 0 to 3‐point scale in the control group, and treatment resulted in a mean improvement of 0.04 points with self‐management (95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.02). Low‐quality evidence from one study (165 people) showed no between‐group difference in quality of life (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01) from a control group mean of 0.57 units on 0 to 1 well‐being scale. Moderate‐quality evidence from five studies (937 people) shows similar withdrawal rates between self‐management (13%) and control groups (12%): RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.57). Positive and active engagement in life was not measured.
