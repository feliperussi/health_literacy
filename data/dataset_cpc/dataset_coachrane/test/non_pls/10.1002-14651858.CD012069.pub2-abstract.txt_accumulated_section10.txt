Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non‐serious adverse events. 
Objectives
To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non‐randomised studies. 
Search methods
In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included non‐randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non‐comparative cohort studies, patient‐control studies, patient reports/series and cross‐sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow‐up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co‐intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS‐I tool for assessing risk of bias in non‐randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life‐threatening or life‐changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non‐serious adverse events and conducted meta‐analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta‐analytic estimates of prevalence from non‐comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.
