Background
Spinal burst fractures result from the failure of both the anterior and the middle columns of the spine under axial compression loads. Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To compare the outcomes of surgical with non‐surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non‐surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done. 
Main results
We included two trials that compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow‐up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding.
