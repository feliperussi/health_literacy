Background
Cannulation techniques have been recognized as being important in causing post‐endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). However, considerable controversy exists about the usefulness of the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique for the prevention of PEP. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique compared to the conventional contrast‐assisted cannulation technique for the prevention of PEP in people undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP for biliary or pancreatic diseases. 
Search methods
For the previous version of this review, we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and major conference proceedings, up to February 2012, with no language restrictions. An updated search was performed on 26 February 2021 for the current version of this review. Two clinical trial registries, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, were also searched in this update. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique versus the contrast‐assisted cannulation technique in people undergoing ERCP. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors conducted study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment independently. Using intention‐to‐treat analysis with random‐effects models, we combined dichotomous data to obtain risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi² test (P < 0.10) and I² statistic (> 50%). To explore sources of heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses according to trial design, publication type, risk of bias, use of precut sphincterotomy, inadvertent guidewire insertion or contrast injection of the pancreatic duct (PD), use of a PD stent, cannulation device, and trainee involvement in cannulation. To assess the robustness of our results, we carried out sensitivity analyses using different summary statistics (RR versus odds ratio (OR)) and meta‐analytic models (fixed‐effect versus random‐effects) and per‐protocol analysis. 
Main results
15 RCTs comprising 4426 participants were included. There was moderate heterogeneity among trials for the outcome of PEP (P = 0.08, I² = 36%). Meta‐analyses suggest that the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique probably reduces the risk of PEP compared to the contrast‐assisted cannulation technique (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, 15 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). In addition, the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique may result in an increase in primary cannulation success (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12, 13 studies, low‐certainty evidence), and probably reduces the need for precut sphincterotomy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96, 10 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). Compared to the contrast‐assisted cannulation technique, the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique may result in little to no difference in the risk of post‐sphincterotomy bleeding (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.54, 7 studies, low‐certainty evidence) and perforation (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.23, 8 studies, very low‐certainty evidence). Procedure‐related mortality was reported by eight studies, and there were no cases of deaths in both arms (moderate‐certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses suggest that the heterogeneity for the outcome of PEP could be explained by differences in trial design. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique probably reduces the risk of PEP compared to the contrast‐assisted cannulation technique. There is low‐certainty evidence that the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique may result in an increase in primary cannulation success. There is low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence that the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique may result in little to no difference in the risk of bleeding and perforation. No procedure‐related deaths were reported. Therefore, the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique appears to be superior to the contrast‐assisted cannulation technique considering the certainty of evidence and the balance of benefits and harms. However, the routine use of guidewires in biliary cannulation will be dependent on local expertise, availability, and cost. Future research should assess the effectiveness and safety of the guidewire‐assisted cannulation technique in the context of other pharmacologic or non‐pharmacologic interventions for the prevention of PEP.
