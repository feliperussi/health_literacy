Background
A large number of people are employed in sedentary occupations. Physical inactivity and excessive sitting at workplaces have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and all‐cause mortality. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal up to 9 August 2017. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over RCTs, cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs), and quasi‐RCTs of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before‐and‐after studies. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self‐reported or measured using devices such as an accelerometer‐inclinometer and duration and number of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more. We considered energy expenditure, total time spent sitting (including sitting at and outside work), time spent standing at work, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required. 
Main results
We found 34 studies — including two cross‐over RCTs, 17 RCTs, seven cluster‐RCTs, and eight controlled before‐and‐after studies — with a total of 3,397 participants, all from high‐income countries. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (16 studies), workplace policy changes (four studies), information and counselling (11 studies), and multi‐component interventions (four studies). One study included both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that specifically investigated the effects of standing meetings or walking meetings on sitting time. 
Physical workplace changes 
Interventions using sit‐stand desks, either alone or in combination with information and counselling, reduced sitting time at work on average by 100 minutes per workday at short‐term follow‐up (up to three months) compared to sit‐desks (95% confidence interval (CI) −116 to −84, 10 studies, low‐quality evidence). The pooled effect of two studies showed sit‐stand desks reduced sitting time at medium‐term follow‐up (3 to 12 months) by an average of 57 minutes per day (95% CI −99 to −15) compared to sit‐desks. Total sitting time (including sitting at and outside work) also decreased with sit‐stand desks compared to sit‐desks (mean difference (MD) −82 minutes/day, 95% CI −124 to −39, two studies) as did the duration of sitting bouts lasting 30 minutes or more (MD −53 minutes/day, 95% CI −79 to −26, two studies, very low‐quality evidence). 
We found no significant difference between the effects of standing desks and sit‐stand desks on reducing sitting at work. Active workstations, such as treadmill desks or cycling desks, had unclear or inconsistent effects on sitting time. 
Workplace policy changes 
We found no significant effects for implementing walking strategies on workplace sitting time at short‐term (MD −15 minutes per day, 95% CI −50 to 19, low‐quality evidence, one study) and medium‐term (MD −17 minutes/day, 95% CI −61 to 28, one study) follow‐up. Short breaks (one to two minutes every half hour) reduced time spent sitting at work on average by 40 minutes per day (95% CI −66 to −15, one study, low‐quality evidence) compared to long breaks (two 15‐minute breaks per workday) at short‐term follow‐up. 
Information and counselling 
Providing information, feedback, counselling, or all of these resulted in no significant change in time spent sitting at work at short‐term follow‐up (MD −19 minutes per day, 95% CI −57 to 19, two studies, low‐quality evidence). However, the reduction was significant at medium‐term follow‐up (MD −28 minutes per day, 95% CI −51 to −5, two studies, low‐quality evidence).
