Background
Mother‐infant proximity and interactions after birth and during the early postpartum period are important for breast‐milk production and breastfeeding success. Rooming‐in and separate care are both traditional practices. Rooming‐in involves keeping the mother and the baby together in the same room after birth for the duration of hospitalisation, whereas separate care is keeping the baby in the hospital nursery and the baby is either brought to the mother for breastfeeding or she walks to the nursery. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of mother‐infant rooming‐in versus separation on the duration of breastfeeding (exclusive and total duration of breastfeeding). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of mother‐infant rooming‐in versus separate care after hospital birth or at home on the duration of breastfeeding, proportion of breastfeeding at six months and adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included one trial (involving 176 women) in this review. This trial included four groups with a factorial design. The factorial design took into account two factors, i.e. infant location in relation to the mother and the type of infant apparel. We combined three of the groups as the intervention (rooming‐in) group and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair‐wise comparison. 
Primary outcomes 
The primary outcome, duration of any breastfeeding, was reported by authors as median values because the distribution was found to be skewed. They reported the overall median duration of any breastfeeding to be four months, with no difference found between groups. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six months of age was not reported in the trial. There was no difference found between the two groups in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.39; one trial; 137 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
The mean frequency of breastfeeds per day on day four postpartum for the rooming‐in group was 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher than the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day. However, between‐group comparison of this outcome was not appropriate since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming‐in group 86% (99 of 115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17 of 38), (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; low‐quality evidence). None of our other pre‐specified secondary outcomes were reported.
