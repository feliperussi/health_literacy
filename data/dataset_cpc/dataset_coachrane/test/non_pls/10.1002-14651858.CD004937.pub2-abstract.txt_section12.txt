Thirty‐four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta‐analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was ‐75 mmol/24‐h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was ‐4.18 mmHg (95% CI: ‐5.18 to ‐3.18, I2=75%) for systolic and ‐2.06 mmHg (95% CI: ‐2.67 to ‐1.45, I2=68%) for diastolic BP. Meta‐regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24‐h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24‐h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta‐analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was ‐5.39 mmHg (95% CI: ‐6.62 to ‐4.15, I2=61%) for systolic and ‐2.82 mmHg (95% CI: ‐3.54 to ‐2.11, I2=52%) for diastolic BP. In normotensives, the mean effect was ‐2.42 mmHg (95% CI: ‐3.56 to ‐1.29, I2=66%) for systolic and ‐1.00 mmHg (95% CI: ‐1.85 to ‐0.15, I2=66%) for diastolic BP. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic BP was significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Meta‐analysis of hormone and lipid data showed that the mean effect was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, I2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, I2=62%) for aldosterone, 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, I2=5%) for noradrenaline, 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: ‐0.25 to 13.64, I2=12%) for adrenaline, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: ‐0.02 to 0.11, I2=0%) for cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: ‐0.01 to 0.12, I2=0%) for LDL, ‐0.02 mmol/l (95% CI: ‐0.06 to 0.01, I2=16%) for HDL, and 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: ‐0.02 to 0.09, I2=0%) for triglycerides.
