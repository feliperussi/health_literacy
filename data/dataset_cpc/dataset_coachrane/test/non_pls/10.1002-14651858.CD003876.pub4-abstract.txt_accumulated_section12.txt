Background
Dental caries remains a major public health problem in most industrialised countries, affecting 60% to 90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults. Milk may provide a relatively cost‐effective vehicle for fluoride delivery in the prevention of dental caries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of milk fluoridation for preventing dental caries at a community level. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (inception to November 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to November 2014) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to November 2014). We also searched the U.S. National Institutes of Health Trials Register (https://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch) for ongoing trials. We did not place any restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with an intervention and follow‐up period of at least two years, comparing fluoridated milk with non‐fluoridated milk. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included one unpublished RCT, randomising 180 children aged three years at study commencement. The setting was nursery schools in an area with high prevalence of dental caries and a low level of fluoride in drinking water. Data from 166 participants were available for analysis. The study carried a high risk of bias. After three years, there was a reduction of caries in permanent teeth (mean difference (MD) −0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.24 to −0.02) and in primary teeth (MD −1.14, 95% CI −1.86 to −0.42), as measured by the decayed, missing and filled teeth index (DMFT for permanent teeth and dmft for primary teeth). For primary teeth, this is a substantial reduction, equivalent to a prevented fraction of 31%. For permanent teeth, the disease level was very low in the study, resulting in a small absolute effect size. The included study did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (adverse events, dental pain, antibiotic use or requirement for general anaesthesia due to dental procedures).
