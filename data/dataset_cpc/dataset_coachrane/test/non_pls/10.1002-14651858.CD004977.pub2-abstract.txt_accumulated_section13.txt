Background
Pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in low‐income countries. The effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, and mortality needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To update the 2004 review on the efficacy of PCVs in preventing vaccine‐serotypes IPD (VT‐IPD) , X‐ray defined pneumonia among HIV‐1 negative children, and other new outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1990 to Week 4 February 2009); and EMBASE (1974 to March 2009). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCV with placebo, or another vaccine, in children under two with IPD and clinical / radiographic pneumonia as outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified studies, extracted data, and evaluated their corresponding risks of bias. Differences were resolved by discussion. Meta‐analysis used the inverse variance method. 
Main results
We identified 11 publications from six RCTs conducted in Africa, US, Philippines and Finland where 57,015 children received PCV; while 56,029 received placebo or another vaccine. Seven publications provided high quality evidence on PCV efficacy against IPD and four provided moderate quality evidence against pneumonia. None of the five trials with all‐cause mortality data were powered to investigate this outcome. Only two trials have data on all‐cause admissions. 
The main analysis for this review involved HIV‐1 negative children and used the pooled results of random‐effects model, intent‐to‐treat analysis (ITT).
