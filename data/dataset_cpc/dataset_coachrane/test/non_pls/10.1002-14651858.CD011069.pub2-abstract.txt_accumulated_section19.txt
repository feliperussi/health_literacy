Background
Incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide. Blood glucose monitoring plays a crucial part in maintaining glycaemic control in women with GDM and is generally recommended by healthcare professionals. There are several different methods for monitoring blood glucose which can be carried out in different settings (e.g. at home versus in hospital). 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare the effects of different methods and settings for glucose monitoring for women with GDM on maternal and fetal, neonatal, child and adult outcomes, and use and costs of health care. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (qRCTs) comparing different methods (such as timings and frequencies) or settings, or both, for blood glucose monitoring for women with GDM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE, for:
‐ primary outcomes for mothers: that is, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; caesarean section; type 2 diabetes; and 
‐ primary outcomes for children: that is, large‐for‐gestational age; perinatal mortality; death or serious morbidity composite; childhood/adulthood neurosensory disability; 
‐ secondary outcomes for mothers: that is, induction of labour; perineal trauma; postnatal depression; postnatal weight retention or return to pre‐pregnancy weight; and 
‐ secondary outcomes for children: that is, neonatal hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood adiposity; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs (10 RCTs; one qRCT) that randomised 1272 women with GDM in upper‐middle or high‐income countries; we considered these to be at a moderate to high risk of bias. We assessed the RCTs under five comparisons. For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we downgraded for study design limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Three trials received some support from commercial partners who provided glucose meters or financial support, or both. 
Main comparisons  
Telemedicine versus standard care for glucose monitoring (five RCTs): we observed no clear differences between the telemedicine and standard care groups for the mother, for:
