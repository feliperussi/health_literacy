Background
Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) comprise up to 2% of all fractures. These fractures are mostly caused by a fall from a height, and are common in younger adults. Treatment can be surgical or non‐surgical; however, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical compared with conservative treatment of displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fractures in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 27), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, and Orthopaedic Trauma Association annual meeting archives (1996 to 2011). Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical versus conservative management for displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fractures. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were function (e.g. walking ability) and chronic pain. Risk ratios were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Missing standard deviations were calculated from P values. 
Main results
Four trials were included (602 participants). Three trials were small single‐centre trials, and the fourth a large multi‐centre trial including 424 participants. All trials had methodological flaws, usually failure to conceal allocation and incomplete follow‐up data, which put them at high risk of bias. Follow‐up ranged from 1 to 15 years after treatment.
