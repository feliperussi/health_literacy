Background
Fast‐track cardiac care is a complex intervention involving several components of care during cardiac anaesthesia and in the postoperative period, with the ultimate aim of early extubation after surgery, to reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital. Safe and effective fast‐track cardiac care may reduce hospital costs. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, updated in 2012 and updated now in 2016. 
Objectives
To determine the safety and effectiveness of fast‐track cardiac care compared with conventional (not fast‐track) care in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fast‐track cardiac care intervention includes administration of low‐dose opioid‐based general anaesthesia or use of a time‐directed extubation protocol, or both. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 2012 to May 2015), Embase (January 2012 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; January 2012 to May 2015) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (January 2012 to May 2015), along with reference lists of articles, to identify additional trials. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized controlled trials of adult cardiac surgical patients (coronary artery bypass grafts, aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement) that compared fast‐track cardiac care and conventional (not fast‐track) care groups. We focused on the following fast‐track interventions, which were designed for early extubation after surgery: administration of low‐dose opioid‐based general anaesthesia during cardiac surgery and use of a time‐directed extubation protocol after surgery. The primary outcome was risk of mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, reintubation within 24 hours of surgery, time to extubation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, quality of life after surgery and hospital costs.
