Background
The prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids, the mainstay of treatment of acute exacerbations, are not effective for maintenance of remission and its chronic use is limited by numerous adverse events. Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) agents for maintenance of medically‐induced remission in Crohn's disease have produced conflicting results. 
Objectives
To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral 5‐ASA agents for the maintenance of medically‐induced remission in Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 8 June 2016. We also searched reference lists and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared oral 5‐ASA agents to either placebo or sulphasalazine in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. The trials had to have a treatment duration of at least six months. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and performed the risk of bias assessment. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included time to relapse, adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events. We calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a fixed‐effect model. All data were analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis and drop‐outs were considered to be relapses. Sensitivity analyses included an available case analysis where drop‐outs were ignored and using a random‐effects model. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes using the GRADE criteria. 
Main results
Twelve studies (2146 participants) that compared 5‐ASA to placebo were included. We did not identify any studies that compared sulphasalazine to placebo. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The other studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias for various items due to insufficient details to allow for a judgement. There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Fifty‐three per cent (526/998) of 5‐ASA patients (dose 1.6 g to 4 g/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 54% (544/1016) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07; 11 studies; 2014 patients; moderate‐quality evidence). Sensitivity analyses based on an available case analysis and a random‐effects model had no impact on the results. One study found no difference in relapse rates at 24 months. Fifty‐four per cent (31/57) of 5‐ASA patients (dose 2 g/day) relapsed at 24 months compared to 58% (36/62) of placebo patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.29, 119 patients; low‐quality evidence). One paediatric study found no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Sixty‐two per cent (29/47) of paediatric 5‐ASA patients (dose 50 mg/kg/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (35/55) of paediatric placebo patients (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31; 102 patients; moderate‐quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event, withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events. Thirty‐four per cent (307/900) of 5‐ASA patients had at least one adverse event compared to 33% (301/914) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 10 studies; 1814 patients). Fourteen per cent (127/917) of 5‐ASA patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 13% (119/916) of placebo patients (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.38; 9 studies; 1833 patients). One per cent (3/293) of 5‐ASA patients had a serious adverse event compared to 0.7% (2/283) of placebo patients (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.83; 3 studies; 576 patients). Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash.
