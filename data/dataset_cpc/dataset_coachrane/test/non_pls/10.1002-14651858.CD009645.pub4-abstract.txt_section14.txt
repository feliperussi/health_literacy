Thirty‐four trials with a total of 985 participants measured upper extremity function at the end of the intervention period. Twenty‐four studies with 792 participants that presented absolute values found no effect in favour of tDCS (SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.38; moderate‐quality evidence). Ten studies with 193 participants that presented change values also found no effect (SMD 0.33, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.79; low‐quality evidence). Regarding the effects of tDCS on upper extremity function at the end of follow‐up, we identified five studies with a total of 211 participants (absolute values) without an effect (SMD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.39; moderate‐quality evidence). Three studies with 72 participants presenting change scores found an effect (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.04 to 2.11; low‐quality evidence). Twelve studies with 258 participants reported outcome data for lower extremity function and 18 studies with 553 participants reported outcome data on muscle strength at the end of the intervention period, but there was no effect (high‐quality evidence). Three studies with 156 participants reported outcome data on muscle strength at follow‐up, but there was no evidence of an effect (moderate‐quality evidence). Two studies with 56 participants found no evidence of effect of tDCS on cognitive abilities (low‐quality evidence), but one study with 30 participants found evidence of effect of tDCS for improving spatial neglect (very low‐quality evidence). In 47 studies with 1330 participants, the proportions of dropouts and adverse events were comparable between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.13; random‐effects model; moderate‐quality evidence).
