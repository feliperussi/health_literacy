Background
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may cause occlusions (blockages) in the main arteries of lower limbs. One treatment option is bypass surgery using autologous (the patient's own tissue) vein graft or prosthetic (artificial) graft. A number of factors influence occlusion rates in these patients, including the material used. To prevent graft occlusion patients are usually treated with antiplatelet, antithrombotic drugs, or a combination of both. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of thrombosis in people with lower limb atherosclerosis who were undergoing femoropopliteal or femorodistal bypass grafting. Outcomes included the overall success of therapy (graft patency and limb salvage rates) and complications of treatment. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched June 2014) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 5). We sought additional trials through screening the reference lists of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Two review authors, RB and AL, independently reviewed studies found in the search and evaluated them based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resolving disagreements through discussion. 
Data collection and analysis
RB and AL independently extracted details of the selected studies for the update. We compared the treatment and control groups for important prognostic factors and differences described. If any data were unavailable, we sought further information from study authors. We synthesised data by comparing group results. We addressed unit of analysis issues by subgroup analysis. 
Main results
We include 16 studies with 5683 randomised participants. Nine different treatment groups were evaluated: aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing (six studies); ASA or ASA/DIP versus pentoxifylline (two studies); ASA/DIP versus indobufen (one study); ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists (two studies); ASA/DIP versus low molecular weight heparin (one study); ticlopidine versus placebo (one study); ASA versus prostaglandin E1 (one study); ASA versus naftidrofuryl (one study); and clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone (one study). The treatment comparisons were evaluated separately, and, where possible, we performed subgroup analysis for venous grafts and prosthetic grafts and at different follow‐up time points. The quality of evidence was low to moderate as many of the treatment comparisons had very few studies to contribute data, several of the included studies had unit of analysis issues, the treatment dosages varied between studies, and data for many outcomes important to this review were not given in any of the studies, or differed greatly between studies. Overall study quality was moderate, with the largest problem being that the majority of studies did not describe their methods of randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors, leading to risk ratings of 'unclear'. The other main issue with study quality was studies not blinding participants or personnel.
