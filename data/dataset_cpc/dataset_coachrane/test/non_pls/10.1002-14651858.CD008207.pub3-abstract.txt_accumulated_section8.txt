Background
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common form of orthopaedic surgery. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which consists of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major and potentially fatal complication after TKA. The incidence of DVT after TKA is 40% to 80% and the incidence of PE is approximately 2%. It is generally agreed that thromboprophylaxis should be used in patients who undergo TKA. Both pharmacological and mechanical methods are used in the prevention of DVT. Pharmacological methods alter the blood coagulation profile and may increase the risk of bleeding complications. When pharmacological methods cannot be used the mechanical methods become crucial for VTE prophylaxis. Continuous passive motion (CPM) is provided through an external motorised device which enables a joint to move passively throughout a preset arc of motion. Despite the theoretical effectiveness and widespread use of CPM, there are still differing views on the effectiveness of CPM as prophylaxis against thrombosis after TKA. This is an update of the review first published in 2012. 
Objectives
The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of continuous passive motion (CPM) therapy for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‚Äêordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (to week 1 February 2014) and EMBASE (to Week 07 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of CPM with control in preventing DVT or PE after TKA. People aged 18 years and older who had undergone TKA were included in this review. We excluded studies of patients who presented with DVT at baseline. The experimental and control groups received similar postoperative care and therapy other than the CPM.
