Background
This is an update of the original review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 11, and updated in 2015, Issue 4. 
Chemotherapy has significantly improved prognosis for women with malignant and some non‐malignant conditions. This treatment, however, is associated with ovarian toxicity. The use of gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, both agonists and antagonists, may have a protective effect on the ovaries. The primary mechanism of action of GnRH analogues is to suppress the gonadotropin levels to simulate pre‐pubertal hormonal milieu and subsequently prevent primordial follicles from maturation and therefore decrease the number of follicles that are more vulnerable to chemotherapy. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of GnRH analogues given before or in parallel to chemotherapy to prevent chemotherapy‐related ovarian damage in premenopausal women with malignant or non‐malignant conditions. 
Search methods
The search was run for the original review in July 2011, and for the first update in July 2014. For this update we searched the following databases in November 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, which examined the effect of GnRH analogues for chemotherapy‐induced ovarian failure in premenopausal women, were eligible for inclusion in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed binary data using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and for continuous data, we used the standardized mean difference (SMD) to combine trials. We applied the random‐effects model in our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table for our main outcomes of interest.
