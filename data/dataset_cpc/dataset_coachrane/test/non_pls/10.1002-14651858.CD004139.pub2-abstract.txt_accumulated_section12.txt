Background
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in childhood and febrile neutropenia is a potentially life‐threatening side effect of its treatment. Current treatment consists of supportive care plus antibiotics. Clinical trials have attempted to evaluate the use of colony‐stimulating factors (CSF) as additional therapy to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL. Individual trials have not demonstrated significant benefit. Systematic reviews provide the most reliable assessment and the best recommendations for practice. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the addition of granulocyte colony‐stimulating factors (G‐CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factors (GM‐CSF) to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in children with ALL in an effort to prevent the development of febrile neutropenia. Evaluation of number of febrile neutropenia episodes, length to neutrophil count recovery, incidence and length of hospitalisation, number of infectious disease episodes, incidence and length of treatment delays, side effects (flu‐like syndrome, bone pain and allergic reaction), relapse and overall mortality (death). 
Search methods
The search covered the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, LILACS, and SciElo. We manually searched records of conference proceedings of ASCO and ASH from 1985 to 2003 and used the electronic databases of the ASCO and ASH web sites to search for abstracts from 2003 to September 2008, as well as databases of ongoing trials. We consulted experts and scanned references from the relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CSF with placebo or no treatment as primary or secondary prophylaxis to prevent febrile neutropenia in children with ALL. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and critically appraised studies and extracted relevant data. The end points of interest were:   * Primary end points: number of febrile neutropenia episodes and overall mortality (death)  * Secondary end points: time to neutrophil count recovery, incidence and length of hospitalisation, number of infectious diseases episodes, incidence and length of treatment delays, side effects (flu‐like syndrome, bone pain and allergic reaction) and relapse.   We conducted a meta‐analysis of these end points and expressed the results as Peto odds ratios. For continuous outcomes we calculated a weighted mean difference and a standardised mean difference. For count data, we conducted a meta‐analysis of the logarithms of the rate ratios using generic inverse variance. 
Main results
We scanned more than 6800 citations and included six studies with a total of 333 participants in the analysis. There were insufficient data to assess the effect on survival. The use of CSF significantly reduced the number of episodes of febrile neutropenia episodes (Rate Ratio = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.85; P = 0.003, with substantial heterogeneity), the length of hospitalisation (weighted mean difference (WMD) = ‐1.58; 95% CI ‐3.00 to ‐0.15; P = 0.03), and number of infectious disease episodes (Rate Ratio = 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80; P = 0.002). Despite these results, CSF did not influence the length of episodes of neutropenia (WMD = ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐3.55 to 1.32; P = 0.4) or delays in chemotherapy courses (Rate Ratio = 0.75; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.20; P = 0.23) .
