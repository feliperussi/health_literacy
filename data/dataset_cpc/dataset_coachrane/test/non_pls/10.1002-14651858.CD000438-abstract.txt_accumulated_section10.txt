Background
Despite the increased use of antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement therapy, pulmonary disease, principally due to the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates. In addition to immaturity, lung distension during conventional ventilation (CV) is thought to be responsible for pulmonary air leak (PAL) and, together with oxygen toxicity, may be important in the cause of chronic lung disease (CLD). Studies of animals have suggested that high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is an effective method of providing ventilation and oxygenation in severe experimental pulmonary disease and may result in less lung injury. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of HFOV compared to conventional ventilation (CV) on pulmonary air leak and CLD in preterm infants with very severe lung disease requiring ventilation. 
Search methods
A search was carried out for all randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE (1980 ‐ April 2007) and EMBASE (1982 ‐ April 2007) using the MeSH and text terms, "high frequency ventilation", "high frequency oscillatory ventilation", "oscillatory ventilation". The Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials and trials identified by the Neonatal Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2007) were also reviewed. Information was also sought from experts in the field, cross references from studies and proceedings of meetings of the American Society for Pediatric Research (1991 ‐ 2006). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of HFOV vs. CV as rescue therapy in preterm infants with severe pulmonary dysfunction. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard review method of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes independent quality assessment and data extraction by the second author. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) were used to express treatment effects.
