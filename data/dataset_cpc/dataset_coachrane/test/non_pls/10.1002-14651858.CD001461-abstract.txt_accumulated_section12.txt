Background
Azathioprine is a purine analogue with immunosuppressive properties. Although several trials have reported a beneficial effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), because of concerns over its safety it is generally used only in severe RA. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐term effects of azathioprine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 3, 2000), Medline up to and including August 2000 and Embase from 1988 to August 2000. We also conducted a handsearch of the reference lists of the trials retrieved from the electronic search. 
Selection criteria
All randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing azathioprine against placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was extracted independently by two reviewers (CS, EB); disagreements were resolved by discussion or third party adjudication (MS). The same reviewers (CS, EB) assessed the methodological quality of the trials using a validated quality assessment tool. Rheumatoid arthritis outcome measures were extracted from the publications for the six‐month endpoint. The pooled analysis was performed using standardized mean differences for joint counts, pain and functional status assessments. Weighted mean differences were used for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Toxicity was evaluated with pooled odds ratios for withdrawals and for adverse reactions. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are presented. A chi‐square test was used to assess heterogeneity among trials. Fixed effects models were used throughout, since no statistical heterogeneity was found. 
Main results
Three trials with a total of 81 patients were included in the analysis. Forty patients were randomized to azathioprine and forty‐one to placebo. A pooled estimate was calculated for two outcomes. A statistically significant benefit was observed for azathioprine when compared to placebo for tender joint scores. The standardized weighted mean difference between treatment and placebo was ‐0.98 (95% CI ‐1.45, ‐0.50). Withdrawals from adverse reactions were significantly higher in the azathioprine group OR=4.56 (95% CI 1.16, 17.85).
