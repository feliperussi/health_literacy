Background
Strategies for reducing breast cancer mortality in western countries have focused on screening, at least for women aged 50 to 69 years. One of the requirements of any community screening program is to achieve a high participation rate, which is related to methods of invitation. Therefore, it was decided to systematically review the scientific evidence on the different strategies aimed at improving women's participation in breast cancer screening programs and activities. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different strategies for increasing the participation rate of women invited to community (population‐based) breast cancer screening activities or mammography programs. 
Search methods
MEDLINE (1966‐2000), CENTRAL (2000), and EMBASE (1998‐1999) searches for 1966 to 1999 were supplemented by reports and letters to the European Screening Breast Cancer Programs (Euref Network). 
Selection criteria
Both published and unpublished trials were eligible for inclusion, provided the women had been invited to a community breast screening activity or program and had been randomised to an intervention group or a control group with no active intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We identified 151 articles, which were reviewed independently by two people. The discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer in order to reach consensus. Thirty‐four studies were excluded because they lacked a control group; 58 of the other 117 articles were considered as opportunistic and not community‐based; 59 articles, which reported 70 community‐based randomised controlled trials or clinical controlled trials, were accepted. In 24 of these, the control group had not been exposed to any active intervention, but 8 of the 24 had to be excluded because the denominator for estimating attendance was unknown. At the end, 16 studies constituted the material for this review, although two studies were further excluded because their groups were not comparable at baseline. Data from all but one study were based on or converted to an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Attendance in response to the mammogram invitation was the main outcome measure.
