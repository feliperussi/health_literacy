Background
Magnesium maintenance therapy is one of the types of tocolytic therapy used after an episode of threatened preterm labour (usually treated with an initial dose of tocolytic therapy) in an attempt to prevent the onset of further preterm contractions. 
Objectives
To assess whether magnesium maintenance therapy is effective in preventing preterm birth after the initial threatened preterm labour is arrested. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of magnesium therapy given to women after threatened preterm labour. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. We checked data entry. 
Main results
We included four trials involving 422 women. Three trials had high risk of bias and none included any long‐term follow‐up of infants. No differences in the incidence of preterm birth or perinatal mortality were seen when magnesium maintenance therapy was compared with placebo or no treatment; or alternative therapies (ritodrine or terbutaline). The risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) for magnesium compared with placebo or no treatment was 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.40 (two trials, 99 women); and 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.72 (two trials, 100 women) for magnesium compared with alternative therapies. The RR for perinatal mortality for magnesium compared with placebo or no treatment was 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.16 (one trial, 50 infants); and 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.16 (one trial, 50 infants) for magnesium compared with alternative treatments.
