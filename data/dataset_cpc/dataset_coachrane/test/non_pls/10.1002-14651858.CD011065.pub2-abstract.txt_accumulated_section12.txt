Background
Tongue‐tie, or ankyloglossia, is a condition whereby the lingual frenulum attaches near the tip of the tongue and may be short, tight and thick. Tongue‐tie is present in 4% to 11% of newborns. Tongue‐tie has been cited as a cause of poor breastfeeding and maternal nipple pain. Frenotomy, which is commonly performed, may correct the restriction to tongue movement and allow more effective breastfeeding with less maternal nipple pain. 
Objectives
To determine whether frenotomy is safe and effective in improving ability to feed orally among infants younger than three months of age with tongue‐tie (and problems feeding). 
Also, to perform subgroup analysis to determine the following.
• Severity of tongue‐tie before frenotomy as measured by a validated tool (e.g. Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (ATLFF) scores < 11; scores ≥ 11) (Hazelbaker 1993). 
• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks' gestation; 37 weeks' gestation and above).
• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).
• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three months of age).
• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty affecting weight gain (as assessed by infant's not regaining birth weight by day 14 or falling off centiles); infants with symptomatic feeding difficulty but thriving (greater than birth weight by day 14 and tracking centiles). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL up to January 2017, as well as previous reviews including cross‐references, expert informants and journal handsearching. We searched clinical trials databases for ongoing and recently completed trials. We applied no language restrictions.
