Background
Rotaviruses cause viral gastroenteritis and result in more deaths from diarrhoea in children under 5 years of age than any other single agent, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
Objectives
To assess rotavirus vaccines in relation to preventing rotavirus diarrhoea, death, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trial register (October 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2003), LILACS (1982 to October 2003), Biological Abstracts (January 1982 to October 2003), reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers and rotavirus vaccine manufacturers. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing rotavirus vaccines to placebo, no intervention, or other rotavirus vaccines in children and adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodological quality, and contacted trial authors for additional information. 
Main results
Sixty‐four trials provided information on efficacy and safety of three main types of rotavirus vaccine (bovine, human, and rhesus) for 21,070 children. Different levels of efficacy were demonstrated with different vaccines varying from 22 to 89% to prevent one episode of rotavirus diarrhoea, 11 to 44% to prevent one episode of all‐cause diarrhoea, and 43 to 90% to prevent one episode of severe rotavirus diarrhoea. Rhesus vaccine demonstrated a similar efficacy against one episode of rotavirus diarrhoea (37 and 44% respectively), and one episode of all‐cause diarrhoea (around 15%) for trials performed in high and middle‐income countries. Results on mortality and safety of the vaccines were scarce and incomplete. We noticed important heterogeneity among the pooled studies and were unable to discard a biased estimation of effect.
