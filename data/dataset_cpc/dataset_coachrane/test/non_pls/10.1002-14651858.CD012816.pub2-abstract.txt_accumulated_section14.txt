Background
There has been considerable development in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer over the last decade. A number of agents, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and sipuleucel‐T, have been reported to improve outcomes in men with castration‐resistant disease and their use is being explored in hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early taxane‐based chemohormonal therapy for newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 10 August 2018. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials in which participants were administered taxane‐based chemotherapy with systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 120 days of beginning ADT versus ADT alone at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified three studies in which 2,261 participants were randomized to receive either ADT alone, or taxane‐based chemotherapy at a dose of 75mg per square meter of body surface area at three‐weekly intervals for six or nine cycles in addition to ADT. 
Primary outcomes 
Early treatment with taxane‐based chemotherapy in addition to ADT probably reduces death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence); this would result in 94 fewer deaths per 1,000 men (95% CI 51 to 137 fewer deaths). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations related to potential performance bias. Based on the results of one study with 375 participants, the addition of taxane‐based chemotherapy to ADT may increase the incidence of Grade III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio (RR) 2.98, 95% CI 2.19 to 4.04; low‐certainty evidence); this would result in 405 more Grade III to V adverse events per 1,000 men (95% CI 243 to 621 more events). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to study limitations and imprecision.
