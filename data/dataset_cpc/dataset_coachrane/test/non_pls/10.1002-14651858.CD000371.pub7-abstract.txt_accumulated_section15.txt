Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. Global advocacy organizations claim routine deworming has substantive health and societal effects beyond the removal of worms. In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms. 
Objectives
To summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil‐transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow‐up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster‐RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty‐four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth‐stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden. 
First or single dose of deworming drugs 
Fourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high‐burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta‐analysis across all studies (I2 statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low‐certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. 
For height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low‐certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate‐certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low‐certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low‐certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low‐certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality.
