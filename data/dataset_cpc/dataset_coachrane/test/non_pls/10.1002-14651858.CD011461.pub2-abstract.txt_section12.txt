We included 11 studies randomizing 4014 participants to molecular‐targeted therapy plus conventional chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Five were at low risk of bias, and we considered the risk of bias in the other six studies to be high, mainly due to their open‐label design. All identified studies reported data regarding survival. We found low‐quality evidence that molecular‐targeted may have a small effect on mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05, 10 studies) compared with conventional chemotherapy alone. Similarly, it may have little effect on progression‐free survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04, 11 studies; low‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence from subgroup analysis that survival outcomes differed by type of molecular‐targeted agent (EGFR‐ or VEGF‐targeting agents) or tumor type, meaning that we were unable to explain the variation in effect across the studies by the presence or absence of prognostic biomarkers or type of molecular‐targeted agent. From 11 eligible trials, we were able to use data from 3723 participants with measurable tumors. We found low‐quality evidence that molecular‐targeted therapy may increase tumor response (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.55, low‐quality evidence). Data from one small trial were too limited to determine the effect of treatment on quality of life (very low‐quality evidence). The addition of targeted therapy to chemotherapy probably increases the risk of adverse events (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.92, 5 trials, 2290 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) and severe adverse event (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37, 8 trials, 3800 participants), compared with receiving chemotherapy alone.
