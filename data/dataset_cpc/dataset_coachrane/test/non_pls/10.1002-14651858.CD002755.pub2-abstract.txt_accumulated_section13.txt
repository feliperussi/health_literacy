Background
Mortality and morbidity from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain high. Intravenous magnesium started early after the onset of AMI is thought to be a promising adjuvant treatment. Conflicting results from earlier trials and meta‐analyses warrant a systematic review of available evidence. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of intravenous magnesium versus placebo on early mortality and morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2006), and the Chinese Biomedical Disk (CBM disk) (January 1978 to June 2006). Some core Chinese medical journals relevant to the cardiovascular field were hand searched from their starting date to the first‐half year of 2006. 
Selection criteria
All randomized controlled trials that compared intravenous magnesium with placebo in the presence or absence of fibrinolytic therapy in addition to routine treatment were eligible if they reported mortality and morbidity within 35 days of AMI onset. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed the trial quality and extracted data using a standard form. Odds ratio (OR) were used to pool the effect if appropriate. Where heterogeneity of effects was found, clinical and methodological sources of this were explored. 
Main results
For early mortality where there was evidence of heterogeneity, a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis showed no difference between magensium and placebo groups (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.04), while a random‐effects meta‐analysis showed a significant reduction comparing magnesium with placebo (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82). Stratification by timing of treatment (< 6 hrs, 6+ hrs) reduced heterogeneity, and in both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models no significant effect of magnesium was found. In stratified analyses, early mortality was reduced for patients not treated with thrombolysis (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.94 by random‐effects model) and for those treated with less than 75 mmol of magnesium (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.70) in the magnesium compared with placebo groups. 
Meta‐analysis for the secondary outcomes where there was no evidence of heterogeneity showed reductions in the odds of ventricular fibrillation (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96), but increases in the odds of profound hypotension (OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.19) and bradycardia (OR=1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.77) comparing magnesium with placebo. No difference was observed for heart block (OR=1.05, 95% CI 0.97‐1.14). For those outcomes where there was evidence of heterogeneity, meta‐analysis with both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models showed that magnesium could decrease ventricular tachycardia (OR=0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.66 by fixed‐effect model; OR=0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.84 by random‐effects model) and severe arrhythmia needing treatment or Lown 2‐5 (OR=0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85 by fixed‐effect model; OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79 by random‐effects model) compared with placebo. There was no difference on the effect of cardiogenic shock between the two groups.
