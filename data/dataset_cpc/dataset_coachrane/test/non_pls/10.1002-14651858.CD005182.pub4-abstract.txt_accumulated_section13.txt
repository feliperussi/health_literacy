Background
Patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) in the community frequently fail to meet treatment goals ‐ a condition labelled as "uncontrolled" hypertension. The optimal way to organize and deliver care to hypertensive patients has not been clearly identified. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension. To evaluate the effectiveness of reminders on improving the follow‐up of patients with hypertension. 
Search methods
All‐language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) and Medline; and Embase from January 1980. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with hypertension that evaluated the following interventions:  (1) self‐monitoring  (2) educational interventions directed to the patient  (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional  (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care  (5) organisational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care  (6) appointment reminder systems 
Outcomes assessed were:  (1) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure  (2) control of blood pressure  (3) proportion of patients followed up at clinic 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook. 
Main results
72 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies varied. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD) ‐8.0 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐8.8 to ‐7.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD ‐4.3 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐4.7 to ‐3.9 mmHg) for three strata of entry blood pressure, and all‐cause mortality at five years follow‐up (6.4% versus 7.8%, difference 1.4%) in a single large RCT‐ the Hypertension Detection and Follow‐Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self‐monitoring was associated with moderate net reduction in systolic blood pressure (WMD ‐2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐3.7 to ‐1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD ‐1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐2.4 to ‐1.2 mmHg). RCTs of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way forward, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control and mean SBP and DBP but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems also require further evaluation due to heterogeneity and small trial numbers, but the majority of trials increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow‐up (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73).
