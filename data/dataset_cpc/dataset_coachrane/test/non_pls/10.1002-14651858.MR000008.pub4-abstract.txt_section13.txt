We found 481 eligible trials. The trials evaluated 110 different ways of increasing response to postal questionnaires. We found substantial heterogeneity among trial results in half of the strategies. The odds of response were at least doubled using monetary incentives (odds ratio 1.87; 95% CI 1.73 to 2.04; heterogeneity P < 0.00001, I2 = 84%), recorded delivery (1.76; 95% CI 1.43 to 2.18; P = 0.0001, I2 = 71%), a teaser on the envelope ‐ e.g. a comment suggesting to participants that they may benefit if they open it (3.08; 95% CI 1.27 to 7.44) and a more interesting questionnaire topic (2.00; 95% CI 1.32 to 3.04; P = 0.06, I2 = 80%). The odds of response were substantially higher with pre‐notification (1.45; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.63; P < 0.00001, I2 = 89%), follow‐up contact (1.35; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.55; P < 0.00001, I2 = 76%), unconditional incentives (1.61; 1.36 to 1.89; P < 0.00001, I2 = 88%), shorter questionnaires (1.64; 95% CI 1.43 to 1.87; P < 0.00001, I2 = 91%), providing a second copy of the questionnaire at follow up (1.46; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.90; P < 0.00001, I2 = 82%), mentioning an obligation to respond (1.61; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.22; P = 0.98, I2 = 0%) and university sponsorship (1.32; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.54; P < 0.00001, I2 = 83%). The odds of response were also increased with non‐monetary incentives (1.15; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22; P < 0.00001, I2 = 79%), personalised questionnaires (1.14; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22; P < 0.00001, I2 = 63%), use of hand‐written addresses (1.25; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45; P = 0.32, I2 = 14%), use of stamped return envelopes as opposed to franked return envelopes (1.24; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.35; P < 0.00001, I2 = 69%), an assurance of confidentiality (1.33; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.42) and first class outward mailing (1.11; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21; P = 0.78, I2 = 0%). The odds of response were reduced when the questionnaire included questions of a sensitive nature (0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00; P = 0.51, I2 = 0%).
