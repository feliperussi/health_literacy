Background
Many people with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with strong opioids, such as oxycodone and morphine. Strong opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all people, neither are they well tolerated by all people. The aim of this review was to assess whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other analgesic options for adults with cancer pain. This is an updated Cochrane review previously published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone by any route of administration for pain in adults with cancer. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (ISI Web of Science), BIOSIS (ISI), and PsycINFO (Ovid) to November 2021. We also searched four trial registries, checked the bibliographic references of relevant studies, and contacted the authors of the included studies. We applied no language, date, or publication status restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (parallel‐group or cross‐over) comparing oxycodone (any formulation or route of administration) with placebo or an active drug (including oxycodone) for cancer background pain in adults by examining pain intensity/relief, adverse events, quality of life, and participant preference. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently sifted the search, extracted data and assessed the included studies using standard Cochrane methodology. We meta‐analysed pain intensity data using the generic inverse variance method, and pain relief and adverse events using the Mantel‐Haenszel method, or summarised these data narratively along with the quality of life and participant preference data. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
For this update, we identified 19 new studies (1836 participants) for inclusion. In total, we included 42 studies which enrolled/randomised 4485 participants, with 3945 of these analysed for efficacy and 4176 for safety. The studies examined a number of different drug comparisons.
