Background
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are laboratory‐produced molecules derived from the B cells of an infected host. They are being investigated as potential prophylaxis to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising mAbs, including mAb fragments, to prevent infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 causing COVID‐19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases on 27 April 2022. We checked references, searched citations, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising mAbs, including mAb fragments, alone or combined, versus an active comparator, placebo, or no intervention, for pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of COVID‐19. We excluded studies of SARS‐CoV‐2‐neutralising mAbs to treat COVID‐19, as these are part of another review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane RoB 2. Prioritised outcomes were infection with SARS‐CoV‐2, development of clinical COVID‐19 symptoms, all‐cause mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included four RCTs of 9749 participants who were previously uninfected and unvaccinated at baseline. Median age was 42 to 76 years. Around 20% to 77.5% of participants in the PrEP studies and 35% to 100% in the PEP studies had at least one risk factor for severe COVID‐19. At baseline, 72.8% to 82.2% were SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody seronegative.
