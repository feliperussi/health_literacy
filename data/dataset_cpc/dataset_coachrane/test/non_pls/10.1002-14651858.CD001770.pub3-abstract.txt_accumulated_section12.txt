Background
Infantile spasms (West's Syndrome) is a syndrome that includes a peculiar type of epileptic seizure—the spasms—and an electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality often called hypsarrhythmia. Psychomotor retardation is frequently found at follow‐up. Approximately two‐thirds of affected infants will have a detectable underlying neurological abnormality, but still little is known about the pathophysiological basis for infantile spasms, and treatment remains problematic. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of single pharmaceutical therapies used to treat infantile spasms in terms of control of the spasms, resolution of the EEG, relapse rates, psychomotor development, subsequent epilepsy, side effects, and mortality. 
Search methods
To identify published data, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (October 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), and the reference lists of all retrieved articles. To identify unpublished data, we searched the ISRCTN Register (www.controlled‐trials.com), corresponded with colleagues and drug companies, and made requests at international conferences. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the administration of drug therapy to patients with infantile spasms. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection from all relevant publications was independently undertaken by three review authors (before 2010) or by two review authors using a standard proforma. Analysis included assessment of study quality and a search for sources of heterogeneity. 
Main results
We found 16 small RCTs (fewer than 100 patients enrolled) and 2 larger RCTs (more than 100 patients enrolled). These 18 studies looked at a total of 916 patients treated with a total of 12 different pharmaceutical agents. Overall methodology of the studies was poor, in part because of ethical dilemmas such as giving placebo injections to children. Two studies showed that placebo was not as good as active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different. The same study suggests that hormonal treatments might improve the long‐term developmental outcome compared with vigabatrin in infants not found to have an underlying cause for their infantile spasms.
