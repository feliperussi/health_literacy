Background
Cyclosporine was first found to be an effective and well‐tolerated immunosuppressive agent in organ transplant recipients, and subsequently in several autoimmune diseases. It was reported in open studies that cyclosporine is effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Four randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine whether the results observed in these open studies were valid. This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the use of oral cyclosporine for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of oral cyclosporine for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence and absence of concomitant steroid therapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate clinical response rates and adverse events associated with cyclosporine. 
Search methods
Computer‐assisted searches of the on‐line bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed to identify potentially relevant publications between 1980 and June 2008. The MeSH terms "Crohn Disease" or "Inflammatory Bowel disease" and "Cyclosporin" (exploded) were used to perform key word searches of the databases. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched for relevant studies. Appropriate officials at Sandoz Corporation were contacted to seek information on any unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
Prospective, randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trials of parallel design with treatment duration of a minimum 12 weeks comparing oral cyclosporine therapy with placebo for treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion.
