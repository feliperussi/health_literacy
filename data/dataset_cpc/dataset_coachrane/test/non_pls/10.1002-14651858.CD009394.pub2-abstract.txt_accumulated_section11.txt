Background
Gastroschisis is an uncommon congenital defect of the anterior abdominal wall that results in herniation of intestinal loops outside the abdominal cavity. Babies with gastroschisis generally do well, but there remains a mortality rate of 5% to 10% and some require prolonged parenteral nutrition and intensive care. Significant injury to the exposed bowel may occur in‐utero, and earlier birth may reduce this, improve long‐term outcomes and reduce complications, such as necrotising enterocolitis. However, it may also increase complications related to prematurity. There is a lack of published data in this area. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of elective preterm birth for fetal gastroschisis in pregnancies complicated by this condition. The mode of birth may be either vaginal or by caesarean section, but this review is studying only timing, not the route, of birth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (16 January 2013). 
Selection criteria
Individual patient randomised controlled trials of planned preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by fetal gastroschisis, diagnosed by ultrasound scanning in time for preterm birth to be an option, and without other fetal anomalies. The intervention is planned preterm birth, prior to 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation, versus planned later birth, at or after 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation (mode of birth is not part of the intervention). 
We did not include quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cluster trials. Cross‐over trials are not appropriate for this condition. Studies that were presented in abstract form only were eligible for inclusion, providing that the population included women with pregnancies affected by fetal gastroschisis, the interventions were defined and the treatment selection was randomised. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion the one trial identified as a result of the search strategy and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data and checked it for accuracy.
