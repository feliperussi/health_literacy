We included two trials with 851 patients that evaluated the efficacy and safety of daclizumab versus placebo for RRMS. We judged them to be at low risk of bias. Due to different time point evaluations and available data on primary studies, we were unable to undertake a meta‐analysis. At 24 weeks, the median change was 0 (range ‐2 to 3) in the interferon beta and placebo group, 0 (‐2 to 4) in the interferon beta and low‐dose daclizumab group and 0 (‐2 to 2) in the interferon beta and high‐dose daclizumab group in 230 participants. The proportion of patients who had new clinical relapses were the following: 16 patients (21%) in the interferon beta and high‐dose daclizumab group, 19 (24%) in the interferon beta and low‐dose daclizumab group and 19 (25%) in the interferon beta and placebo group had relapses (P value = 0.87). At 52 weeks, the changes in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from baseline was 0.09 ± 0.71 in placebo group, ‐0.08 ± 0.52 in low‐dose daclizumab group and 0.05 ± 0.61 in high‐dose daclizumab group in 621 participants. There was a significant difference between placebo and low‐dose daclizumab groups (P value = 0.01), but no significant difference between placebo and high‐dose daclizumab groups (P value = 0.49). The proportion of patients with new relapsing MS was significantly reduced in both daclizumab groups (19% in low‐dose daclizumab group, 20% in high‐dose daclizumab group) compared with placebo group (36%) (P value < 0.0001 and P value = 0.00032, respectively). There was no increased number of patients in any adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07) or serious adverse events in daclizumab groups compared with placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.54). Infections were the most frequent adverse events in treated participants and were resolved with standard therapies. One trial was still ongoing.
