Background
The association between dietary antioxidants and asthma or exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is not fully understood. Vitamin C and vitamin E are natural antioxidants that are predominantly present in fruits and vegetables; inadequate vitamin E intake is associated with airway inflammation. It has been postulated that the combination may be more beneficial than either single antioxidant for people with asthma and exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of supplementation of vitamins C and E versus placebo (or no vitamin C and E supplementation) on exacerbations and health‐related quality of life (HRQL) in adults and children with chronic asthma. To also examine the potential effects of vitamins C and E on exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction in people with asthma and in people without a diagnosis of asthma who experience symptoms only on exercise. 
Search methods
Trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register and from trial registry websites. Searches were conducted in September 2013. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma. We separately considered trials in which participants had received a diagnosis of exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction (or exercise‐induced asthma). Trials comparing vitamin C and E supplementation versus placebo were included. We included trials in which asthma management for treatment and control groups included similar background therapy. Short‐term use of vitamins C and E at the time of exacerbation or for cold symptoms in people with asthma is outside the scope of this review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of potential studies and subsequently screened full‐text study reports for inclusion. We used standard methods as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
