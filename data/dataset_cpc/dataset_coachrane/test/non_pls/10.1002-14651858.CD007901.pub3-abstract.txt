Background
Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are the most abundant fatty acids in the brain and are necessary for growth and maturation of an infant's brain and retina. LCPUFAs are named “essential” because they cannot be synthesised efficiently by the human body and come from maternal diet. It remains controversial whether LCPUFA supplementation to breastfeeding mothers is beneficial for the development of their infants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of supplementation with LCPUFA in breastfeeding mothers in the cognitive and physical development of their infants as well as safety for the mother and infant. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 August 2014), CENTRAL (Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 8), PubMed (1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), LILACS (1982 to August 2014), Google Scholar (August 2014) and reference lists of published narrative and systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials or cluster‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of LCPUFA supplementation on breastfeeding mothers (including the pregnancy period) and their infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, performed data extraction and evaluated data accuracy. 
Main results
We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 1567 women. All the studies were performed in high‐income countries. The longest follow‐up was seven years. 
We report the results from the longest follow‐up time point from included studies. Overall, there was moderate quality evidence as assessed using the GRADE approach from these studies for the following outcomes measured beyond 24 months age of children: language development and child weight. There was low‐quality evidence for the outcomes: Intelligence or solving problems ability, psychomotor development, child attention, and child visual acuity. 
We found no significant difference in children's neurodevelopment at long‐term follow‐up beyond 24 months: language development (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.56 to 0.02; two trials, 187 participants); intelligence or problem‐solving ability (three trials, 238 participants; SMD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.36); psychomotor development (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.26; one trial, 113 participants); motor development (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.60 to 0.14; one trial, 115 participants), or in general movements (risk ratio, RR, 1.12, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14; one trial, 77 participants; at 12 weeks of life). However, child attention scores were better at five years of age in the group of children whose mothers had received supplementation with fatty acids (mean difference (MD) 4.70, 95% CI 1.30 to 8.10; one study, 110 participants)). In working memory and inhibitory control, we found no significant difference (MD ‐0.02 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.03 one trial, 63 participants); the neurological optimality score did not present any difference (P value: 0.55). 
For child visual acuity, there was no significant difference (SMD 0.33, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.71; one trial, 111 participants). 
For growth, there were no significant differences in length (MD ‐0.39 cm, 95% CI ‐1.37 to 0.60; four trials, 441 participants), weight (MD 0.13 kg, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.74; four trials, 441 participants), and head circumference (MD 0.15 cm, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.58; three trials, 298 participants). Child fat mass and fat mass distribution did not differ between the intervention and control group (MD 2.10, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 4.68; one trial, 115 participants, MD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.69; one trial, 165 participants, respectively). 
One study (117 infants) reported a significant difference in infant allergy at short‐term follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.95), but not at medium‐term follow‐up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.59). 
We found no significant difference in two trials evaluating postpartum depression. Data were not possible to be pooled due to differences in the describing of the outcome. One study (89 women) did not find any significant difference between the LCPUFA supplementation and the control group at four weeks postpartum (MD 1.00, 95%CI ‐1.72 to 3.72). 
No adverse effects were reported.
Authors' conclusions
Based on the available evidence, LCPUFA supplementation did not appear to improve children's neurodevelopment, visual acuity or growth. In child attention at five years of age, weak evidence was found (one study) favouring the supplementation. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence to support or refute the practice of giving LCPUFA supplementation to breastfeeding mothers in order to improve neurodevelopment or visual acuity.
