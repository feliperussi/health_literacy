Background
Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating, flushing and warming over the preauricular and temporal areas following a gustatory stimulus. It often occurs in patients who have undergone parotidectomy, submandibular gland surgery, radical neck dissection, infection and traumatic injury in the parotid region, and is caused by the aberrant regrowth of facial autonomic nerve fibres. Currently there are several options used to treat patients with Frey's syndrome; for example, the topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and the intradermal injection of botulinum toxin. It is uncertain which treatment is most effective and safe. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of different interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 28 April 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome using a clinical standard such as Minor's starch‐iodine test. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention versus no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Our primary outcome measures were success rate (as assessed clinically by Minor's starch‐iodine test, the iodine‐sublimated paper histogram method, blotting paper technique or another method) and adverse events. Our secondary outcome measure was success rate as assessed by patients (disappearance or improvement of symptoms).
