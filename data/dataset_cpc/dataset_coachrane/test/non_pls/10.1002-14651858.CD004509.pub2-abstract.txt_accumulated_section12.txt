Background
The question of whether adding testosterone therapy to conventional postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) is effective or safe is unresolved. Therefore, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women using HT. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women taking HT. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 21 July, November 2008), The Cochrane Library (2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (1980 to July 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to July 2008), CINAHL (1982 to July 2008), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Studies included randomised comparisons of testosterone plus HT versus HT alone in peri or postmenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, a Peto odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. For continuous outcomes, non‐skewed data from valid scales were synthesized using a weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference. If statistical heterogeneity was found, a random‐effects model was used and reasons for the heterogeneity were explored and discussed. 
Main results
Thirty‐five trials with a total of 4768 participants were included in the review. The median study duration was six months (range 1.5 to 24 months). Most of the trials were of adequate quality with regard to randomisation and concealment of allocation sequence. The major methodological limitations were attrition bias and lack of a washout period in the crossover studies. The pooled estimate suggested that the addition of testosterone to HT regimens improved sexual function scores and number of satisfying sexual episodes for postmenopausal women. Significant adverse effects were decreased high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and an increased incidence of hair growth and acne. The discontinuation rate was not significantly greater with the addition of testosterone therapy (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19).
