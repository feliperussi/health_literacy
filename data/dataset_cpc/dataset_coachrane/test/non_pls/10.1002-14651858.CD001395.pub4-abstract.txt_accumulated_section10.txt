Background
Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are very common during the menopausal transition. Hormone therapy has traditionally been used as a highly effective treatment, but concerns about increased risk of some chronic diseases have markedly increased the interest of women in alternative treatments. Some of the most popular of these treatments are foods or supplements enriched with phytoestrogens—plant‐derived chemicals that have estrogenic action. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of food products, extracts and dietary supplements containing high levels of phytoestrogens when compared with no treatment, placebo or hormone therapy for the amelioration of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (such as hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. 
Search methods
Searches targeted the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of randomised trials (29 July 2013), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 29 July 2013), MEDLINE (inception to 29 July 2013), EMBASE (inception to 29 July 2013), AMED (1985 to 29 July 2013), PsycINFO (inception to 29 July 2013) and CINAHL (inception to 29 July 2013). Attempts were made to access grey literature by sending letters to pharmaceutical companies and performing searches of ongoing trial registers. Reference lists of included trials were also searched. 
Selection criteria
Studies were included if they were randomised, included perimenopausal or postmenopausal participants with vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes or night sweats), lasted at least 12 weeks and provided interventions such as foods or supplements with high levels of phytoestrogens (not combined with other herbal treatments). Trials that included women who had breast cancer or a history of breast cancer were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Selection of trials, extraction of data and assessment of quality were undertaken by at least two review authors. Most trials were too dissimilar for their results to be combined in a meta‐analysis, so these findings are provided in narrative 'Summary of results' tables. Studies were grouped into broad categories: dietary soy, soy extracts, red clover extracts, genistein extracts and other types of phytoestrogens. Five trials used Promensil, a red clover extract; results of these trials were combined in a meta‐analysis, and summary effect measures were calculated.
