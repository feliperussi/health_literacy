Background
Platinum‐based therapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin, or a combination of these, is used to treat a variety of paediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, one of the most important adverse effects is the occurrence of hearing loss or ototoxicity. In an effort to prevent this ototoxicity, different platinum infusion durations have been studied. This review is the third update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different durations of platinum infusion to prevent hearing loss or tinnitus, or both, in children with cancer. Secondary objectives were to assess possible effects of these infusion durations on: a) anti‐tumour efficacy of platinum‐based therapy, b) adverse effects other than hearing loss or tinnitus, and c) quality of life. 
Search methods
We searched the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 14 November 2019), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 14 November 2019) and Embase (Ovid) (1980 to 14 November 2019). In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and we assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (2009 up to and including 2019) and the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (2014 up to and including 2019). We scanned ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch) for ongoing trials (both searched on 4 November 2019). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing different platinum infusion durations in children with cancer. Only the platinum infusion duration could differ between the treatment groups.
