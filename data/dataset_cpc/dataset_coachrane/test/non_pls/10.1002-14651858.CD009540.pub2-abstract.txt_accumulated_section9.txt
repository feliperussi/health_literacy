Background
Pre‐eclampsia is a pregnancy‐specific multi‐organ disorder, which is characterised by hypertension and multisystem organ involvement and which has significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Failure of the placental vascular remodelling and reduced uteroplacental flow form the etiopathological basis of pre‐eclampsia. There are several established therapies for pre‐eclampsia including antihypertensives and anticonvulsants. Most of these therapies aim at controlling the blood pressure or preventing complications of elevated blood pressure, or both. Epidural therapy aims at blocking the vasomotor tone of the arteries, thereby increasing uteroplacental blood flow. This review was aimed at evaluating the available evidence about the possible benefits and risks of epidural therapy in the management of severe pre‐eclampsia, to define the current evidence level of this therapy, and to determine what (if any) further evidence is required. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety and cost of the extended use of epidural therapy for treating severe pre‐eclampsia in non‐labouring women. This review aims to compare the use of extended epidural therapy with other methods, which include intravenous magnesium sulphate, anticonvulsants other than magnesium sulphate, with or without use of the antihypertensive drugs and adjuncts in the treatment of severe pre‐eclampsia. 
This review only considered the use of epidural anaesthesia in the management of severe pre‐eclampsia in the antepartum period and not as pain relief in labour. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing epidural therapy versus traditional therapy for pre‐eclampsia in the form of antihypertensives, anticonvulsants, magnesium sulphate, low‐dose dopamine, corticosteroids or a combination of these, were eligible for inclusion. Trials using a cluster design, and studies published in abstract form only are also eligible for inclusion in this review. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review.
