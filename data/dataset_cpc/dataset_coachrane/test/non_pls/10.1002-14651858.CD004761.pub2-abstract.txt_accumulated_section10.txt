Background
Fisher syndrome is one of the regional variants of Guillain‐Barré syndrome, characterised by impairment of eye movements (ophthalmoplegia), incoordination (ataxia) and loss of tendon reflexes (areflexia). It can occur in more limited forms, and may overlap with Guillain‐Barré syndrome. A further variant is associated with upper motor neuron signs and disturbance of consciousness (Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis). All of these variants are associated with anti‐GQ1b IgG antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange are often used as treatments in this patient group. This review was undertaken to systematically assess any available randomised controlled data on acute immunomodulatory therapies in Fisher Syndrome or its variants. 
Objectives
To provide the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials on the role of acute immunomodulatory therapy in the treatment of Fisher Syndrome and related disorders. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Trials Specialized Register (February 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2009) and LILACS (January 1982 to February 2009) for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials (in which allocation was not random but was intended to be unbiased, e.g. alternate allocation, and non‐randomised controlled studies were to have been selected. Since no such clinical trials were discovered, all retrospective case series containing five or more patients were assessed and summarised in the discussion section. 
Data collection and analysis
All studies of Fisher Syndrome and its clinical variants were scrutinised for data on patients treated with any form of acute immunotherapy. Information on the outcome was then collated and summarised.
