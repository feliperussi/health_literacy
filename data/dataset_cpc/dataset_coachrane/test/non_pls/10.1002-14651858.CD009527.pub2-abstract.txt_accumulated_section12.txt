Background
Malaria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, in particular among children and pregnant women in sub‐Saharan Africa. Prompt access to diagnosis and treatment with effective antimalarial drugs is a central component of the World Health Organization's (WHO) strategy for malaria control. Home‐ or community‐based programmes for managing malaria are one strategy that has been proposed to overcome the geographical barrier to malaria treatment.  
Objectives
To evaluate home‐ and community‐based management strategies for treating malaria.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; Science Citation Index; PsycINFO/LIT; CINAHL; WHO clinical trial registry platform; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials up to September 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs that evaluated the effects of a home‐ or community‐based programme for treating malaria in a malaria endemic setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Where possible the effects of interventions are compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 trials that met the inclusion criteria. The interventions involved brief training of basic‐level health workers or mothers, and most provided the antimalarial for free or at a highly subsidized cost. In eight of the studies, fevers were treated presumptively without parasitological confirmation with microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Two studies trained community health workers to use RDTs as a component of community management of fever.
