Background
Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non‐prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat‐soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium‐dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine‐5'‐triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. 
Objectives
To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross‐over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross‐over studies, we considered data only from the first phase.
