Background
Compared with people without cancer, people with cancer who receive anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are more likely to develop recurrent VTE. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of three types of parenteral anticoagulants (i.e. fixed‐dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), adjusted‐dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), and fondaparinux) for the initial treatment of VTE in people with cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search in the following major databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid) and Embase (via Ovid). We also handsearched conference proceedings, checked references of included studies, and searched for ongoing studies. This update of the systematic review is based on the findings of a literature search conducted on 14 August 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of LMWH, UFH, and fondaparinux in people with cancer and objectively confirmed VTE. 
Data collection and analysis
Using a standardised form, we extracted data – in duplicate – on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all‐cause mortality, symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, postphlebitic syndrome, quality of life, and thrombocytopenia. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Of 11,484 identified citations, 3073 were unique citations and 15 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria, none of which were identified in the latest search. These trials enrolled 1615 participants with cancer and VTE: 13 compared LMWH with UFH; one compared fondaparinux with UFH and LMWH; and one compared dalteparin with tinzaparin, two different types of low molecular weight heparin.
