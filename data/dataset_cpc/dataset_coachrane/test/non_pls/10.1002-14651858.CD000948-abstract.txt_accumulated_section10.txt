Background
Endotracheal intubation is a common procedure in newborn intensive care units. The choice of the oral or nasal route for intubation is usually determined by an institution's customary practice. The procedure of intubation for both the oral and nasal routes can be associated with complications. This systematic review was undertaken to compare the complications of both methods. 
Objectives
The purpose of the review was to compare the complications associated with intubation by the nasal route with those associated with intubation by the oral route for mechanical ventilation in newborn infants. 
Search methods
The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in The Cochrane Library was used. This included searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (from January 1996 to July, 2006, all languages), EMBASE (1988 to July 2006) and CINAHL (from 1982 to July 2006), previous reviews including cross references and abstracts. A call was placed on the list servers, NICU‐NET and Neonatal Talk for unpublished trials, conference presentations and current trials. 
Selection criteria
All trials using random or quasi‐random allocation of patients to either the nasal or oral route of intubation were included. Study quality and eligibility were assessed independently by each author. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Neonatal Review Group was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.  The methodological quality of each study was reviewed by the second review author blinded to study authors and institutions.
