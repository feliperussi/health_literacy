Background
This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews investigating pain management for childbirth. These reviews all contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain management for women in labour, and share a generic protocol. This review updates an earlier version of the review of the same title. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness and safety of hypnosis for pain management during labour and childbirth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (30 September 2015) and the reference lists of primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTS comparing preparation for labour using hypnosis and/or use of hypnosis during labour, with or without concurrent use of pharmacological or non‐pharmacological pain relief methods versus placebo, no treatment or any analgesic drug or technique. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Where possible we contacted study authors seeking additional information about data and methodology. 
Main results
We included nine trials randomising a total of 2954 women. The risk of bias in trials was variable, there were several well‐designed large trials and some trials where little was reported about trial design. Although eight of the nine trials assessed antenatal hypnotherapy, there were considerable differences between these trials in timing and technique. One trial provided hypnotherapy during labour. In this updated review we compared hypnosis interventions with all control groups (main comparison) and also with specific control conditions: standard care (nine RCTs), supportive counselling (two RCTs) and relaxation training (two RCTs).
