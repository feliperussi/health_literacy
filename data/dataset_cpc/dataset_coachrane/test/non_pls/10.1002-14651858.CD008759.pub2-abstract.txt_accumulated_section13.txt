Background
Current guidelines recommend screening of people with oesophageal varices via oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy at the time of diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis. This requires that people repeatedly undergo unpleasant invasive procedures with their attendant risks, although half of these people have no identifiable oesophageal varices 10 years after the initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. Platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio are non‐invasive tests proposed as triage tests for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices. 
Objectives
Primary objectives  
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices of any size in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. To investigate the accuracy of these non‐invasive tests as triage or replacement of oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy. 
Secondary objectives  
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of these same tests for the diagnosis of high‐risk oesophageal varices in paediatric or adult patients with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, irrespective of aetiology. 
We aimed to perform pair‐wise comparisons between the three index tests, while considering predefined cut‐off values. 
We investigated sources of heterogeneity.
Search methods
The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Register, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and Science Citation Index ‐ Expanded (Web of Science) (14 June 2016). We applied no language or document‐type restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of platelet count, spleen length, and platelet count‐to‐spleen length ratio for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices via oesophago‐gastro‐duodenoscopy as the reference standard in children or adults of any age with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis, who did not have variceal bleeding.
