Background
Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent condition and a major cause of disability and absence from the workplace worldwide. Opioids are frequently used to treat chronic pain, although adverse effects often restrict their long‐term benefits. Tapentadol is an opioid and noradrenaline re‐uptake inhibitor, which may cause a lower incidence (and severity) of adverse effects compared to other strong opioids. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tapentadol extended‐release for moderate‐to‐severe pain for at least three months for any musculoskeletal cause. 
Search methods
We searched electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science) to March 2014, unrestricted by language, as well as trials registers and reference lists from retrieved studies. We contacted drug manufacturers for further information. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tapentadol in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain compared to placebo or active control. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. We performed two meta‐analyses for the comparisons tapentadol extended release versus placebo and tapentadol extended release versus active control (oxycodone). We used random‐effects models when there was heterogeneity and fixed‐effect models when there was no heterogeneity. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses. The primary efficacy outcome was pain control assessed by change in pain intensity scores and responder's rate (at least 50% pain relief). The primary safety outcome was withdrawal rate due to adverse effects. 
Main results
Four parallel‐design RCTs of moderate quality including 4094 participants with osteoarthritis or back pain, or both, met the inclusion criteria. Three trials were phase III studies with 12 weeks' follow‐up and the fourth trial was an open‐label safety study of 52 weeks' follow‐up. All trials were oxycodone‐controlled and three were also placebo‐controlled. Two trials included people with knee osteoarthritis, one evaluated people with low back pain, and one enrolled both. All studies reported last‐observation‐carried‐forward (LOCF) as the imputation method. We requested baseline‐observation‐carried‐forward (BOCF) imputed analyses and any unpublished data from the manufacturers but the manufacturers denied the request. Two of the four oxycodone‐controlled studies and one of the three placebo‐controlled studies did not provide data on responder rate. We considered two studies to be of high risk of bias.
