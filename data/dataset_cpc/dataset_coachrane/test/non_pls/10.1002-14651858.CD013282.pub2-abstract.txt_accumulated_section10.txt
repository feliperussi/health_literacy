Background
The number of new cases of dementia is projected to rise significantly over the next decade. Thus, there is a pressing need for accurate tools to detect cognitive impairment in routine clinical practice. The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE‐III), and the mini‐ACE are brief, bedside cognitive screens that have previously reported good sensitivity and specificity. The quality and quantity of this evidence has not, however, been robustly investigated. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of the ACE‐III and mini‐ACE for the detection of dementia, dementia sub‐types, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at published thresholds in primary, secondary, and community care settings in patients presenting with, or at high risk of, cognitive decline. 
Search methods
We performed the search for this review on 13 February 2019. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We applied no language or date restrictions to the electronic searches; and to maximise sensitivity we did not use methodological filters. The search yielded 5655 records, of which 2937 remained after we removed duplicates. We identified a further four articles through PubMed 'related articles'. We found no additional records through reference list citation searching, or grey literature. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional studies investigating the accuracy of the ACE‐III or mini‐ACE in patients presenting with, or at high risk of, cognitive decline were suitable for inclusion. We excluded case‐control, delayed verification and longitudinal studies, and studies which investigated a secondary cause of dementia. We did not restrict studies by language; and we included those with pre‐specified thresholds (88 and 82 for the ACE‐III, and 21 or 25 for the mini‐ACE). 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted information on study and participant characteristics and used information on dementia and MCI prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and sample size to generate 2×2 tables in Review Manager 5. We assessed methodological quality of included studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool; and we assessed the quality of study reporting with the STARDdem tool.
