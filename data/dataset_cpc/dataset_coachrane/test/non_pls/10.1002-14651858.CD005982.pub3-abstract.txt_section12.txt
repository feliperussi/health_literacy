One additional study was included for this update bringing the total to two included studies (with 1135 participants). Both studies were open‐label RCTs comparing LMWH with low‐dose UFH to prevent CVC‐related thrombosis in children. We identified no studies comparing LMWH with placebo or no treatment. Meta‐analysis found insufficient evidence of an effect of LMWH prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of CVC‐related thrombosis in children with CVC, compared to low‐dose UFH (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.75; 2 studies; 787 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One study (158 participants) reported symptomatic and asymptomatic CVC‐related thrombosis separately and detected no evidence of a difference between LMWH and low‐dose UFH (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.93; low‐certainty evidence; RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.08; low‐certainty evidence; for symptomatic and asymptomatic participants respectively). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether LMWH impacts the risk of major bleeding (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.67; 2 studies; 813 participants; low‐certainty evidence); or minor bleeding. One study reported minor bleeding in 53.3% of participants in the LMWH arm and in 44.7% of participants in the low‐dose UFH arm (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.58; 1 study; 158 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and the other study reported no minor bleeding in either group (RR: not estimable). Mortality during the study period was reported in one study, where two deaths occurred during the study period. Both were unrelated to thrombotic events and occurred in the low‐dose UFH arm. The second study did not report mortality during therapy per arm but showed similar 5‐year overall survival (low‐certainty evidence). No additional adverse effects were reported. Other pre‐specified outcomes (including CVC occlusion, patency and CRBSI) were not reported.
