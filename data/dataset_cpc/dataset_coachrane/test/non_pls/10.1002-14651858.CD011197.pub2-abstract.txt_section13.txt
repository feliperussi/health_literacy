For mortality, very low‐quality evidence from six trials suggested no clear difference in deaths between the exercise and no‐exercise groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 15.78; participants = 421; I² = 0%; deaths = 2). Very low‐quality evidence from five trials suggested no clear difference between groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05; participants = 381; I² = 0%; events = 8). Low‐quality evidence from two trials suggested no clear difference in health‐related quality of life for the Short Form‐36 (SF‐36) physical component summary measure (mean difference (MD) 1.96, 95% CI ‐2.50 to 6.42; participants = 224; I² = 69%), or the SF‐36 mental component summary measure (MD 1.99, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 4.46; participants = 224; I² = 0%). Exercise capacity was assessed by cumulated work, or maximal power (Watt), obtained by cycle ergometer, or by six minute walking test, or ergospirometry testing measuring VO2 peak. We found moderate‐quality evidence from two studies that exercise‐based rehabilitation increased exercise capacity, measured by VO2 peak, more than no exercise (MD 3.76, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.15; participants = 208; I² = 0%); and very low‐quality evidence from four studies that exercise‐based rehabilitation increased exercise capacity more than no exercise, measured by the six‐minute walking test (MD 75.76, 95% CI 14.00 to 137.53; participants = 272; I² = 85%). When we combined the different assessment tools for exercise capacity, we found very low‐quality evidence from six trials that exercise‐based rehabilitation increased exercise capacity more than no exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.26; participants = 359; I² = 65%). Overall, the quality of the evidence for the outcomes ranged from moderate to very‐low.
