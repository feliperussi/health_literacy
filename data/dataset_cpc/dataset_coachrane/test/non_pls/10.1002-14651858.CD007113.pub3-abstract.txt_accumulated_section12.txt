Background
Policies and protocols for fetal surveillance in the pregnancy where impaired fetal growth is suspected vary widely, with numerous combinations of different surveillance methods. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antenatal fetal surveillance regimens on important perinatal and maternal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (29 February 2012). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing the effects of described antenatal fetal surveillance regimens. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors R Grivell and L Wong independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. 
Main results
We included one trial of 167 women and their babies. This trial was a pilot study recruiting alongside another study, therefore, a separate sample size was not calculated. The trial compared a twice‐weekly surveillance regimen (biophysical profile, nonstress tests, umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery Doppler and uterine artery Doppler) with the same regimen applied fortnightly (both groups had growth assessed fortnightly). There were insufficient data to assess this review's primary infant outcome of composite perinatal mortality and serious morbidity (although there were no perinatal deaths) and no difference was seen in the primary maternal outcome of emergency caesarean section for fetal distress (risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 2.63). In keeping with the more frequent monitoring, mean gestational age at birth was four days less for the twice‐weekly surveillance group compared with the fortnightly surveillance group (mean difference (MD) ‐4.00; 95% CI ‐7.79 to ‐0.21). Women in the twice‐weekly surveillance group were 25% more likely to have induction of labour than those in the fortnightly surveillance group (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.50).
