Background
Cryptococcal disease remains one of the main causes of death in HIV‐positive people who have low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends screening HIV‐positive people with low CD4 counts for cryptococcal antigenaemia (CrAg), and treating those who are CrAg‐positive. This Cochrane Review examined the effects of an approach where those with low CD4 counts received regular prophylactic antifungals, such as fluconazole. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of antifungal drugs for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults and children who are HIV‐positive. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE PubMed, Embase OVID, CINAHL EBSCOHost, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings for the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), and reference lists of relevant articles up to 31 August 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of adults and children, who are HIV‐positive with low CD4 counts, without a current or prior diagnosis of cryptococcal disease that compared any antifungal drug taken as primary prophylaxis to placebo or standard care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted and analysed data. The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality. We summarized all outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta‐analyses. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Nine trials, enrolling 5426 participants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Six trials administered fluconazole, while three trials administered itraconazole.
