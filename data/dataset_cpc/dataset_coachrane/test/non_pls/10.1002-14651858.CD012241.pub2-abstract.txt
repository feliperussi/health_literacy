Background
Education of family members about infant weaning practices could affect nutrition, growth, and development of children in different settings across the world. 
Objectives
To compare effects of family nutrition educational interventions for infant weaning with conventional management on growth and neurodevelopment in childhood. 
Search methods
We used the standard strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 26 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 26 June 2018), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 26 June 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and references of retrieved articles. 
We ran an updated search from 1 January 2018 to 12 December 2019 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCOhost. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that examined effects of nutrition education for weaning practices delivered to families of infants born at term compared to conventional management (standard care in the population) up to one year of age. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified eligible trial reports from the literature search and performed data extraction and quality assessments for each included trial. We synthesised effect estimates using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 21 trials, recruiting 14,241 infants. Five of the trials were conducted in high‐income countries and the remaining 16 were conducted in middle‐ and low‐income countries. Meta‐analysis showed that nutrition education targeted at improving weaning‐related feeding practices probably increases both weight‐for‐age z scores (WAZ) (MD 0.15 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; 6 studies; 2551 infants; I² = 32%; moderate‐certainty evidence) and height‐for‐age z scores (0.12 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.19; 7 studies; 3620 infants; I² = 49%; moderate‐certainty evidence) by 12 months of age. Meta‐analysis of outcomes at 18 months of age was heterogeneous and inconsistent in the magnitude of effects of nutrition education on WAZ and weight‐for‐height z score across studies. One trial that assessed effects of nutrition education on growth at six years reported an uncertain effect on change in height and body mass index z score. Two studies investigated effects of nutrition education on neurodevelopment at 12 to 24 months of age with conflicting results. No trials assessed effects of nutrition education on long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Nutrition education for families of infants may reduce the risk of undernutrition in term‐born infants (evidence of low to moderate certainty due to limitations in study design and substantial heterogeneity of included studies). Modest effects on growth during infancy may not be of clinical significance. However, it is unclear whether these small improvements in growth parameters in the first two years of life affect long‐term childhood growth and development. Further studies are needed to resolve this question.
