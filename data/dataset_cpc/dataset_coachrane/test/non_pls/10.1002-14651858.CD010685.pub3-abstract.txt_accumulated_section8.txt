Background
Neuroblastoma is a rare malignant disease and mainly affects infants and very young children. The tumours mainly develop in the adrenal medullary tissue, with an abdominal mass as the most common presentation. About 50% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis. The high‐risk group is characterised by metastasis and other features that increase the risk of an adverse outcome. High‐risk patients have a five‐year event‐free survival of less than 50%. Retinoic acid has been shown to inhibit growth of human neuroblastoma cells and has been considered as a potential candidate for improving the outcome of patients with high‐risk neuroblastoma. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional retinoic acid as part of a postconsolidation therapy after high‐dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared to placebo retinoic acid or to no additional retinoic acid in people with high‐risk neuroblastoma (as defined by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE in PubMed (1946 to 24 November 2016), and Embase in Ovid (1947 to 24 November 2016). Further searches included trial registries (on 22 December 2016), conference proceedings (on 23 March 2017) and reference lists of recent reviews and relevant studies. We did not apply limits by publication year or languages. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating additional retinoic acid after HDCT followed by HSCT for people with high‐risk neuroblastoma compared to placebo retinoic acid or to no additional retinoic acid. Primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related mortality. Secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, event‐free survival, early toxicity, late toxicity, and health‐related quality of life.
