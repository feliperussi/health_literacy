Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show considerable variation in symptoms, limitations, and well‐being; this often complicates medical care. A multi‐disciplinary and multi‐component programme that addresses different elements of care could improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise tolerance, while reducing the number of exacerbations. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of health‐related quality of life (QoL), exercise tolerance, and exacerbation‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL for potentially eligible studies. Searches were current as of September 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IDM programmes for COPD versus usual care were included. Interventions consisted of multi‐disciplinary (two or more healthcare providers) and multi‐treatment (two or more components) IDM programmes of at least three months' duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. If required, we contacted study authors to request additional data. We performed meta‐analyses using random‐effects modelling. We carried out sensitivity analyses for the quality of included studies and performed subgroup analyses based on setting, study design, dominant intervention components, and region. 
Main results
Along with 26 studies included in the 2013 Cochrane Review, we added 26 studies for this update, resulting in 52 studies involving 21,086 participants for inclusion in the meta‐analysis. Follow‐up periods ranged between 3 and 48 months and were classified as short‐term (up to 6 months), medium‐term (6 to 15 months), and long‐term (longer than 15 months) follow‐up. Studies were conducted in 19 different countries. The mean age of included participants was 67 years, and 66% were male. Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings, including primary (n =15), secondary (n = 22), and tertiary care (n = 5), and combined primary and secondary care (n = 10). Overall, the level of certainty of evidence was moderate to high. 
We found that IDM probably improves health‐related QoL as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at medium‐term follow‐up (mean difference (MD) ‐3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.16 to ‐1.63; 18 RCTs, 4321 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). A comparable effect was observed at short‐term follow‐up (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.29 to ‐1.28; 16 RCTs, 1788 participants). However, the common effect did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. There was no significant difference between IDM and control for long‐term follow‐up and for generic QoL.
