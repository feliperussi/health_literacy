Background
Mechanical ventilation (MV) for critically ill neonates was introduced in the 1960s and is now standard treatment for infants with severe RDS. However, the degree to which this made a contribution to the outcome of such infants is uncertain. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of the use of MV compared with no MV on mortality and morbidity in newborn infants with severe respiratory failure due to pulmonary disease. 
Search methods
Searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE were updated in March 2010. Searches were also carried out of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials and for abstracts published by the Society for Pediatric Research (1967 to 2004 inclusive) and the European Society for Pediatric Research (1970 to 2004 inclusive). 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials in newborn infants with respiratory failure due to pulmonary disease evaluating the use of MV versus standard neonatal care without MV. 
Data collection and analysis
The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. 
Main results
The five eligible trials reported on a total of 359 infants with RDS. Overall the risk of any reported mortality was less frequent in the MV group (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74, 1.00; RD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.20, ‐0.01; NNT 10, 95% CI 5, 100). In infants with a birth weight of 1 to 2 kg, no significant difference in mortality was found (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70, 1.07). In infants with a birth weight of more than 2 kg there was a significant reduction in mortality with MV (summary RR 0.67, 95%CI 0.52, 0.87).
