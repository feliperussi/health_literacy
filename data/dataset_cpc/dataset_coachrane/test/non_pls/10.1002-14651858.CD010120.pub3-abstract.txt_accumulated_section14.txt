Background
Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant‐reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non‐selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. 
We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons ‐ NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. 
Low‐certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4‐point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health‐related quality of life were not measured.
