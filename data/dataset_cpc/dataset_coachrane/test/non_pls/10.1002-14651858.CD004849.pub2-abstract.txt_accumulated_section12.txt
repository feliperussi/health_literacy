Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that results in joint deformity and immobility of the musculoskeletal system. The major goals of treatment are to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, slow down or stop joint damage, prevent disability, and preserve or improve the person's sense of well‐being and ability to function. Tai Chi, interchangeably known as Tai Chi Chuan, is an ancient Chinese health‐promoting martial art form that has been recognized in China as an effective arthritis therapy for centuries. This is an update of a review published in 2004. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of Tai Chi as a treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Search methods
We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries from 2002 to September 2018. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials examining the benefits (ACR improvement criteria or pain, disease progression, function, and radiographic progression), and harms (adverse events and withdrawals) of exercise programs with Tai Chi instruction or incorporating principles of Tai Chi philosophy. We included studies of any duration that included control groups who received either no therapy or alternate therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Adding three studies (156 additional participants) to the original review, this update contains a total of seven trials with 345 participants. Participants were mostly women with RA, ranging in age from 16 to 80 years, who were treated in outpatient settings in China, South Korea, and the USA. The majority of the trials were at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias, due to the lack of blinding of participants or assessors. Almost 75% of the studies did not report random sequence generation, and we judged the risk of bias as unclear for allocation concealment in the majority of studies. The duration of the Tai Chi programs ranged from 8 to 12 weeks.
