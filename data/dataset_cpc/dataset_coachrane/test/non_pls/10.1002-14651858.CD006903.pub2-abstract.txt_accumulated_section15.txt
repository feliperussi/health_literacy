Background
Peer support telephone calls have been used for a wide range of health‐related concerns. However, little is known about their effects. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of peer support telephone calls in terms of physical (e.g. blood pressure), psychological (e.g. depressive symptoms), and behavioural health outcomes (e.g. uptake of mammography) and other outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched: The Cochrane Library databases (CENTRAL, DARE, CDSR) (issue 4 2007); MEDLINE (OVID) (January 1966 to December 2007); EMBASE (OVID) (January 1985 to December 2007); CINAHL (Athens) (January 1966 to December 2007), trials registers and reference lists of articles, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of peer support interventions delivered by telephone call. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We present results narratively and in tabular format. Meta‐analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity between studies. 
Main results
We included seven studies involving 2492 participants.
Peer support telephone calls were associated with an increase in mammography screening, with 49% of women in the intervention group and 34% of women in the control group receiving a mammogram since the start of the intervention (P </ = 0.001). In another study, peer telephone support calls were found to maintain mammography screening uptake for baseline adherent women (P = 0.029). 
Peer support telephone calls for post myocardial infarction patients were associated at six months with a change in diet in the intervention and usual care groups of 54% and 44% respectively (P = 0.03). In another study for post myocardial infarction patients there were no significant differences between groups for self‐efficacy, health status and mental health outcomes. 
Peer support telephone calls were associated with greater continuation of breastfeeding in mothers at 3 months post partum (P = 0.01).
