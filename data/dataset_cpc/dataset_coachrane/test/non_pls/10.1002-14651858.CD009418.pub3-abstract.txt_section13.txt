In one study, participants with TASC‐II D lesions were randomized to receive either SIA with stenting of the superficial femoral artery or remote endarterectomy (RE) with stenting of the superficial femoral artery. Three‐year follow‐up results showed a Rutherford classification improvement of 64% in the SIA group compared to 80% in the RE group (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.03; 95 participants; P = 0.079). Postexercise ankle brachial index improvements (defined as an increased value of 0.2) were reported in 70% of participants in the SIA group compared to 82% in the RE group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; 95 participants; P = 0.18). The study reported the technical success rate was 93% for the SIA group and 96% for the RE group (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07; 95 participants; P = 0.91). Primary patency at 12 months was 59.1% in the SIA group compared to 78.4% in the RE group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; 95 participants; P = 0.05). Primary patency at 24 months was 56.8% in the SIA group compared to 76.5% in the RE group (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; 95 participants; P = 0.05) and 47.7% in the SIA group and 62.7% in the RE group at 36 months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.11; 95 participants; P = 0.15). Assisted primary patency was 52.3% in the SIA group compared to 70.6% in the RE group (P = 0.01) at 36 months. Secondary patency was better for the RE group (P = 0.03) at 36 months. Limb salvage at three years' follow‐up was 95% in the SIA group and 98% in the RE group (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 95 participants; P = 0.4). There were no perioperative deaths, but complications occurred in two SIA participants (femoral pseudoaneurysm and pulmonary edema) and in three RE participants (seroma, femoral pseudoaneurysm, superficial femoral artery acute occlusion).
