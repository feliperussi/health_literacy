Background
Surgical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is an established treatment for medically resistant nasal polyp disease. Whether a nasal polypectomy with additional sinus dissection offers any advantage over an isolated nasal polypectomy has not been systematically reviewed. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of simple polyp surgery versus more extensive surgical clearance in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 February 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in patients over 16 with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, who have failed a course of medical management and who have not previously undergone any previous surgical intervention for their nasal disease. Studies compared nasal polypectomy with more extensive sinus clearance in this patient cohort. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified no trials which met our inclusion criteria. Six controlled trials (five randomised) met some but not all of the inclusion criteria and were therefore excluded from the review. 
Authors' conclusions
We are unable to reach any conclusions as to whether isolated nasal polypectomy or more extensive sinus surgery is a superior surgical treatment modality for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. There is a need for high‐quality randomised controlled trials to assess whether additional sinus surgery confers any benefit when compared to nasal polypectomy performed in isolation.
