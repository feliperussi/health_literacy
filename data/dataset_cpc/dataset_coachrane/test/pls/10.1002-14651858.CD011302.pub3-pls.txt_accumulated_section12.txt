Does adding iron to wheat flour reduce anaemia and increase iron levels in the general population? 
Why do we need iron in our diet? 
Iron is an essential mineral found in every cell of the body. It is needed to make haemoglobin, the oxygen‐carrying protein in the blood. Iron molecules in haemoglobin bind to oxygen and carry it from the lungs to all the cells and tissues in the body. Low levels of haemoglobin means the body does not get enough oxygen. 
Anaemia develops when haemoglobin levels in the blood fall too low. Symptoms of anaemia include: tiredness and lack of energy, getting out of breath quickly, pale skin and a greater susceptibility to infections. 
Low haemoglobin levels can be caused by blood loss, pregnancy or not eating enough foods containing iron (iron‐deficiency anaemia). Iron‐deficiency anaemia may be treated by taking iron tablets or eating foods rich in iron. 
Fortified foods 
Adding micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to foods, whether those micronutrients were originally present or not, is called fortification. Fortifying foods is one way to improve nutrition in a population. 
People living in low‐income countries may not have enough iron in their diet, and may be at risk of anaemia. Adding iron and other nutrients to foods routinely eaten in large quantities, such as flour, is thought to help prevent iron‐deficiency anaemia. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how adding iron, and other minerals and vitamins, to wheat flour affected the blood iron levels of the general population, and whether fewer people developed anaemia or other health conditions. We also wanted to know if adding iron to wheat flour caused any unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated eating any types of food made with wheat flour containing added iron, or foods made with wheat flour without added iron. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out the effects of adding iron to wheat flour on people's health and the levels of iron and haemoglobin in their blood.
