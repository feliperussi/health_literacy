Portable oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Background  Some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have low oxygen levels in their blood when they are resting or when moving. Low oxygen levels are known as hypoxaemia. These patients can carry around an oxygen supply (oxygen in small cylinders, portable liquid oxygen systems or battery‐powered oxygen concentrators) so that they have oxygen to breathe to make simple tasks such as getting dressed, leaving the house, doing chores or even walking around their own home easier, and to help them to breathe. This portable oxygen device is referred to as 'ambulatory oxygen.' 
Review question  We conducted this review to find out the long‐term benefit of ambulatory oxygen therapy for people who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest. 
Study characteristics  We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air). We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years. Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada. The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light‐weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. Final follow‐up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study. 
Key results  We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired. However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change. 
Quality of the evidence  The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was moderate. The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported in all cases. Most studies were lacking the pre‐published study plan (protocol).
