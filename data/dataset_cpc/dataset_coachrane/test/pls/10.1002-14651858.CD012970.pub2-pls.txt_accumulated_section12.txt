Probiotics as an added treatment for gestational diabetes to improve mother and baby outcomes 
What is the issue? 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance resulting in high blood glucose levels, first recognised during pregnancy. Pregnant women with GDM are at risk of high blood pressure, labour induction, and caesareans. Their babies are at risk of being born large, birth difficulties, respiratory distress, low blood glucose at birth and jaundice that can cause brain injury. There is increased risks of having long‐term diabetes in the mother, and the baby being overweight. Probiotics are micro‐organisms naturally in food and are in fermented milk, yogurt, or capsules. There are many different probiotics; the two most used are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and if consumed in adequate amounts may confer health benefits. 
Why is this important? 
Probiotics need to be safe and maternal blood glucose levels carefully managed during pregnancy. 
Women with GDM may receive dietary and physical activity education with monitoring blood glucose levels as initial management. When blood glucose levels are above a certain threshold, women with GDM are prescribed glucose‐lowering medications including metformin and/or insulin. This review aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of probiotics in treating women with GDM. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence for randomised controlled trials (latest July 2019). We identified nine studies, involving 695 women with GDM. All trials compared probiotics with placebo. The certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low or low. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear. 
Seven trials were conducted in Iran; one in Thailand, and one in Ireland. Trials took place in hospitals and universities. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo in rates of: high blood‐pressure disorders (three studies, 256 participants, low‐certainty evidence); caesarean section (three studies, 267 women, low‐certainty evidence); and large‐for‐gestational‐age babies (two studies, 174 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo for induction of labour (one study, 127 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) and low blood glucose levels in the newborn (three studies, 177 participants, low‐certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo for heavy bleeding immediately after birth, weight gain during pregnancy or total gestational weight gain. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference in fasting blood glucose between probiotics and placebo (seven studies, 554 participants). Probiotics may be assoicated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol (four studies, 320 participants). There was reduction in insulin secretion with probiotics (seven studies, 505 participants). One trial (60 participants) showed no difference between groups in need for insulin.
