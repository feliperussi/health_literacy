Non‐drug treatments for leg and foot cramps
What is the aim of this review? 
People commonly have muscle cramps at night while trying to sleep, during exercise, during pregnancy, and during haemodialysis (filtering of blood for people with severe kidney problems). Cramps can also occur at other times, and can be especially frequent and severe in children and adults with nerve diseases (for example, Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease). 
There are many treatments available for leg and foot cramps. Most have not been tested in well designed clinical trials. Using untested interventions is not ideal, as people may be wasting their time or money, and may be exposing themselves to risk of harm. In this Cochrane Review, we collected and analysed all relevant studies to find out if any non‐drug interventions were helpful for cramps in the legs and feet. 
Key messages 
There is very little evidence from randomised trials to help people make decisions about non‐drug treatments for leg or foot cramps. We cannot be certain if any non‐drug therapy is particularly helpful, because there are not enough studies on which to base decisions, and cramps have generally not been well measured. No study tested non‐drug therapies in people under age 50 years, or with neurological disease. The current evidence provides some support that combining daily calf and hamstring stretching may reduce the severity of night‐time lower limb muscle cramps in people 55 years of age and older, but the effect on the frequency of cramps is not clear; the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
What was studied in this review? 
We were interested in studies that compared stretching, exercise, massage, relaxation, fatigue avoidance, night‐time temperature control, changes in sleeping and sitting positions, and splints worn while sleeping to each other, to no treatment, or to placebo or sham (pretend) treatment. We excluded studies that examined cramps in pregnancy (as they are covered in another Cochrane Review), or invasive treatments (such as surgery or acupuncture). 
We wondered if therapies could reduce how often cramps occurred, how painful they were, how long each cramp lasted, how many people experienced cramps, how well people could sleep, or join in daily activities, and if there were any harmful effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Three studies (201 participants) provided low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence on the effectiveness of stretching to reduce lower leg cramps in people aged 50 years and older. One study received government funding; the other two did not report a funding source. 
A combination of daily calf and hamstring stretching (compared to no intervention) may reduce the severity of night‐time lower limb muscle cramps in people over 55 years old (1 RCT, 80 people). 
Calf stretching alone (compared to sham stretching) may lead to little or no difference in how often people, aged 60 years and older, have night‐time cramps in any lower limb muscle, although limitations in the study's design make it difficult to see how the results relate to clinical practice (1 RCT, 97 people). 
The evidence is uncertain whether a combination of daily calf, quadriceps, and hamstring stretching (compared to no intervention) reduces the frequency and severity of leg cramps in 50‐ to 60‐year‐old women with metabolic syndrome (a group of health conditions leading to increased risk of heart diseases and related problems), as serious imitations in the study's design limited our confidence in the results (1 RCT, 24 women).
