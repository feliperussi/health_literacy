Metformin and sulphonylurea combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
We wanted to investigate the effects of the combination of the antidiabetic medications metformin plus sulphonylurea compared with other antidiabetic interventions in people with type 2 diabetes. 
Background 
Many people with type 2 diabetes are treated with several types of glucose‐lowering drugs such as 'sulphonylureas' (for example glibenclamide or glyburide, glipizide and gliclazide). These medications lower blood glucose by stimulating the secretion of insulin in the body, thereby increasing insulin levels in the blood. Another antidiabetic agent, metformin lowers blood glucose by improving the body's ability to make insulin work better (insulin sensitivity). The combination of metformin plus sulphonylurea is widely used. We wanted to investigate the effects of metformin plus sulphonylurea on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (for example kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life and side effects of the medications. 
Study characteristics 
We found 32 randomised controlled studies (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), which allocated 28,746 people with type 2 diabetes to either metformin plus sulphonylurea or a comparator group. The comparator groups consisted of the following types of antidiabetic medications in addition to metformin: five studies with glucagon‐like peptide 1 analogues, nine studies with dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 inhibitors, 11 studies with thiazolidinediones, three studies with glinides and four studies with sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors. 
Participants of the studies were treated for between one and four years. There were big differences between people taking part in the studies, especially with regard to age, how long people had diabetes and whether diabetes complications were present at the start of the study. 
This evidence is up to date as of March 2018.
Key results 
Data on patient‐important outcomes were few, and data were sparse for all comparisons of metformin plus sulphonylurea with other antidiabetic medications. The available data did not show firm differences between metformin plus sulphonylurea and other combinations of metformin with antidiabetic drugs or metformin only for most patient‐important outcomes. There were more events with low blood sugar (hypoglycaemic episodes) with metformin plus sulphonylurea combination treatment compared to all other combinations of metformin with another antidiabetic compound. 
We did not identify studies reporting on health‐related quality of life. We identified nine ongoing studies and two yet unpublished studies are awaiting assessment. Together these studies will include around 16,631 participants. Once results are published these studies could significantly influence the findings of our review. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All included studies had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how study authors reported the results. For individual comparisons of the antidiabetic medications the number of participants was often small, resulting in a high risk of random error (play of chance).
