Fluids for people with acute bacterial meningitis
Review question  Why is the effect of differing volumes of initial fluid administration on death and various neurological sequelae in people with acute bacterial meningitis important? 
Background  Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the fluid in the spinal cord and surrounding the brain. Antibiotics are prescribed as treatment. Supportive care includes other drugs and the regulation of fluid intake. There has been disagreement about whether fluids should be restricted or unrestricted as there are potential risks from giving too much fluid (brain swelling) as well as too little fluid (shock). 
Study characteristics  The evidence is current to March 2016. We did not find any trials in adult populations and included three trials involving 420 children. All trials were set in countries where death rates for meningitis are high. In one study no funding source was mentioned. The remaining two studies were funded jointly by pharmaceutical concerns with government agencies and a charitable agency. 
Key results  No studies reported important healthcare outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, raised intracranial pressure, or status epilepticus. An adverse effect in children with restricted fluid intake was that they were less likely to have low levels of sodium in their blood and therefore they would experience greater reductions in body fluids. An adverse effect of unrestricted fluid administration was reported in one study as short‐term swelling of the face and low blood sodium levels one to two days after fluids were started, although the largest study found no difference in blood sodium levels. 
The review found limited evidence from these trials in support of not restricting fluids in settings with high mortality rates. There is no evidence to guide clinicians about fluid therapy in adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis. There is a need for more research on these aspects in the future.  Quality of the evidence  Analysis of available trials found low quality evidence that there is no significant difference between maintenance versus restrictive fluid regimens for the outcome of death and acute severe neurological complications. There was also some evidence favouring maintenance fluid therapy over restricted fluids for chronic severe neurological events at three months follow‐up, but the quality was very low.
