Weight loss interventions for people with chronic kidney disease who are overweight or obese 
What is the issue? 
People who are overweight or obese with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may experience a faster progression to kidney failure than those who are a healthy weight. Some people with more advanced kidney disease may require treatment such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Being obese can make these treatments difficult and may increase a person's risk of health complications. There is limited research looking at whether weight loss interventions are safe and beneficial to help people with CKD lose weight, improve their kidney function, and live longer. 
What did we do? 
We conducted a review of the literature to examine the benefits of weight loss interventions for people with CKD who are overweight or obese. 
What did we find? 
We identified 17 studies involving 988 overweight or obese adults with CKD looking at whether weight loss interventions improved their health. Studies included adults with CKD stages 1 to 4 or kidney transplant recipients. None of the studies included participants who were undergoing dialysis or supportive care. Weight loss interventions included weight loss diets, physical activity programs, drugs to suppress appetite, and weight loss surgery. The main outcomes we were interested in were death, cardiovascular events, weight loss, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, protein in the urine (proteinuria), and blood pressure (BP). 
After combining the available studies, its uncertain whether weight loss interventions helped people live longer or prevented cardiovascular events such as heart complications or stroke as none of the included studies measured these outcomes. We found when compared to no weight loss interventions, weight loss interventions may lead to more weight loss. There were little or no differences seen in BMI, waist circumference, proteinuria, or BP. We found that weight loss surgery achieved more weight loss than non‚Äêsurgical interventions. However, many of the studies included in this review were limited by small participant numbers, high risk of bias and inconsistent reporting of outcome measures leading to the overall quality of the evidence to be very low. This means that we cannot be sure that future studies would find similar results. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is not very certain but suggests that compared with usual care or control those who participated in weight loss interventions may experience some health benefits including improvements in body weight. Whether these benefits help reduce cardiovascular outcomes and the risk of death remains uncertain and require further study.
