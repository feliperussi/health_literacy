Negative pressure wound therapy for treating leg ulcers
Background 
Leg ulcers are wounds that occur between the ankle and the knee as a result of poor blood flow in the legs. These wounds are relatively common often affecting older people. There are several different treatments for these ulcers and the underlying problems that cause them. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a treatment currently beng used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application to the wound of a dressing to which a machine is attached. The machine then applies a carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum), and sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. 
What we found 
After extensive searching up to May 2015 to find all relevant medical studies that might provide evidence about whether NPWT is an effective treatment for leg ulcers, we found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that was eligible for this review. (RCTs provide more robust results than most other trial types.) The study was small with 60 participants who had hard‐to‐heal ulcers. The average age of these participants was 73 years, and 77% of them were women. The study was funded by the manufacturer of the NPWT machine. The study explored the use of NPWT in preparing leg ulcers for a skin graft. In the study, the ulcers were treated with NPWT or with normal (standard) care until the wounds were considered ready to have a skin graft applied. The study's results are not relevant for leg ulcers that are not being prepared for skin grafts. Participants remained in hospitals during treatment and until their wounds healed.
