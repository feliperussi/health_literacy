Muscle energy technique (MET) for non‐specific low‐back pain
This review investigated the 'muscle energy technique' (MET) as a treatment for non‐specific low‐back pain (low‐back pain that cannot be linked to a specific cause). 
MET is a form of manual or 'hands‐on' therapy used by osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists. In this type of therapy, a patient contracts muscles by pushing against resistance provided by the therapist. The therapist then assists the patient in stretching, strengthening and relaxing those muscles. The goal is to help restore normal muscle and joint mobility. 
Review question: is MET a safe and effective treatment for people with non‐specific low‐back pain? 
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration looked for randomised controlled trials (a type of clinical study) that compared MET to other treatment approaches. 
These comparison treatment approaches included no treatment, sham MET treatment, exercise, other manual therapies, ultrasound, electro‐therapies, heat therapy and any combination of these approaches. This review included patients with back pain of any duration, from acute (less than six weeks duration) to chronic (greater than 12 weeks duration). 
The people in these studies ranged in age from 18 to 65 years and had pain ranging in severity from mild to substantial. They usually had about five sessions of MET, or the comparison treatment(s), over a period of about 10 days. 
The review authors aimed to determine if MET helped to relieve pain or increase a person's ability to do normal activities of daily living, or both. 
Background 
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common symptom from adolescence into old age. About 50% of the general population experiences back pain over the course of a year and up to 80% of people report LBP over the course of their lifetimes. 
The vast majority of people have acute (short‐term) back pain and recover within a few weeks, with or without treatment. 
Longer lasting LBP, subacute (for 6 to 12 weeks) and chronic (> 12 weeks) pain, generally has less favourable outcomes. A small proportion of people with acute LBP go on to have chronic disabling LBP, which can interfere with every aspect of normal living, cause significant pain and suffering, and create huge costs in terms of medical care, work disability, and workers’ compensation claims. 
There are many therapies claimed to be useful for the treatment of LBP. Most of these treatments have not been well investigated or have been found to have modest effects in terms of pain relief and improving disability. For many people with LBP, however, even modestly effective treatments can help in coping with symptoms and returning to normal living. It is therefore useful to explore the effectiveness of treatments that may assist people with LBP, particularly those treatments such as MET which are non‐invasive and are likely to be safe and inexpensive. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Collaboration researchers looked for studies (randomised controlled trials) published through to May and June 2014. They included studies where MET was delivered by osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, or physical therapists. 
Twelve randomised controlled trials were found that included a total of 500 patients. All patients in these studies had 'non‐specific LBP', meaning that there was no identifiable cause for their back symptoms. 
After looking at the evidence, The Cochrane Collaboration review authors included four types of comparison treatments, each divided into acute and chronic pain: 
•MET plus any intervention versus that same intervention alone;
•MET versus no treatment;
•MET versus sham MET;
•MET versus all other therapies.
Key results 
The review authors could not find adequate evidence to make any definitive judgements about the safety or effectiveness of MET. Studies were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, producing unreliable answers about this therapy. 
There is a need for larger, high‐quality studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of MET. 
At present there is no convincing evidence that MET is effective as a stand‐alone therapy or improves the effectiveness as an accompaniment to other therapies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was poor. The available studies were small and reported only short term outcomes. Most studies were determined to have a high risk of bias because of the way they were designed and conducted.
