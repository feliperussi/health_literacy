Pushing methods for the second stage of labour
What is the issue? 
During the second stage of labour a common technique is to encourage women to take a deep breath at the beginning of a contraction then hold it and bear down throughout the contraction (this is known as directed pushing). In spontaneous pushing, women are free to follow their own instincts and generally push three to five times per contraction. Delayed pushing involves instructing women to avoid pushing until there is an irresistible urge to push or when the presenting part of the baby has descended to the perineum. 
Why is this important? 
We need to know the benefits and possible disadvantages of different kinds of techniques regarding maternal pushing/breathing during the expulsive stage of labour on maternal and fetal outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on (search date 19 September 2016) and identified eight trials (884 women) comparing the types of pushing: spontaneous pushing versus directed pushing with or without epidural analgesia and 13 trials (2879 women) comparing timing of pushing: delayed pushing versus immediate pushing with epidural analgesia. The quality of the evidence in this updated review ranges from moderate to very low quality. 
Comparison 1: Spontaneous pushing versus directed pushing 
For types of pushing (spontaneous pushing versus directed pushing) there was no clear difference in the duration of the second stage (very low‐quality evidence), perineal laceration (low‐quality evidence), episiotomy, time spent pushing (very low‐quality evidence), or number of women with a spontaneous vaginal birth (moderate‐quality evidence) between the women who spontaneously pushed and the women who were directed. Outcomes relating to the baby (such as five‐minute Apgar score less than seven (very low‐quality evidence), admission to neonatal intensive care (very low‐quality evidence)) were not clearly different. None of the studies reported on the outcome of babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. 
Comparison 2: Delayed pushing versus immediate pushing (women with epidural) 
For the timing of pushing: delayed pushing versus immediate pushing (all women with epidural) ‐ delayed pushing was associated with an increase in the duration of the second stage by about 56 minutes (very low‐quality evidence). There were no clear differences between the two groups in the number of women with perineal laceration (moderate‐quality evidence) and episiotomy. Delayed pushing reduced the duration of pushing by about 19 minutes (very low‐quality of evidence), and slightly increased the number of women with a spontaneous vaginal birth (moderate‐quality evidence). There were no clear differences between the delayed and immediate pushing groups in terms of important outcomes for the baby: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (very low‐quality evidence), admission to neonatal intensive care (low‐quality evidence). None of the studies reported on the outcome of babies with brain damage due to lack of oxygen to the brain. Futhermore, delayed pushing was associated with an increased incidence of low umbilical cord pH and increased the cost of intrapartum care by CDN$ 68.22. 
What does this mean? 
We are unable to say whether spontaneous pushing or directed pushing coaching methods are best. Until further high‐quality studies are available, women should be encouraged to push and bear down according to their comfort and preference. 
Delaying pushing for women with epidural reduces the time spent pushing when giving birth, and increases the likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal birth. However, it increases the duration of the second stage. The possible effects on important neonatal outcomes and maternal perineal injury (serious tears) is still unclear. Therefore, the evidence is still insufficient and inconclusive to support any indication of specific timing of pushing as well as for the type of pushing once there is no conclusive evidence to indicate an adequate style of pushing to be used in the clinical practice. 
Further properly well‐designed randomised controlled trials are required to produce more evidence‐based information. These trials should address clinically important maternal and neonatal outcomes and will provide more complete data to be incorporated into a future update of this review.
