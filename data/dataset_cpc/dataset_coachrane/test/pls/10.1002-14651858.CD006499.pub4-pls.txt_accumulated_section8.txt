Botulinum toxin for the treatment of strabismus
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how well botulinum toxin works as a treatment for strabismus. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and included six studies. 
Key messages  The evidence as to the benefits and harms of using botulinum toxin for strabismus is uncertain. 
What was studied in the review?  Strabismus occurs when the eyes are not aligned. Usually one eye turns inwards or outwards. Less frequently one eye turns upwards or downwards. It is commonly known as "squint". 
Strabismus can lead to blurred vision or double vision. In children it can affect the long term development of vision in the affected eye. There are many causes of strabismus. In most cases, there are problems with the muscles or nerves around the eye. 
Doctors can use botulinum toxin to stop individual muscles around the eye working for a while. This may help the eyes become more aligned and may lead to less blurred or double vision. One problem with using botulinum toxin is that it can result in a droopy eyelid (ptosis). 
What are the main results of the review?  The review shows that: 
• using botulinum toxin in children requiring primary treatment or retreatment for strabismus may make no difference, or slightly reduce the chances of recovering correct alignment of the eyes compared with surgery (low‐certainty evidence); • using botulinum toxin in adults with strabismus may decrease the chances of recovering correct alignment of the eyes compared with surgery (low‐certainty evidence); • people with sixth nerve palsy receiving botulinum toxin may have a similar or small increased chance of correct alignment of eyes compared with no treatment (low‐certainty evidence); • the evidence on using botulinum toxin with surgery, compared with surgery alone, was very uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence); • ptosis occurred commonly in people receiving botulinum toxin in these studies. The number of people affected ranged from 1 in 10 to 1 in 2 people. Everyone recovered when treatment stopped. Ptosis occurred less frequently when treated with botulinum toxin combined with sodium hyaluronate compared to botulinum toxin alone.
