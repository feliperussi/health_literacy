The role of brain radiotherapy (X‐rays) in the treatment of lymphoma in the brain
Background: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a type of cancer that occurs in the brain or spinal cord. It is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma. People who develop PCNSL survive for only four months on average, if they do not receive treatment. For a long time the only treatment showing any benefit was whole brain radiotherapy (WBR), in which X‐rays are used to destroy cancerous cells in the brain. However, several studies suggest that this treatment method also produces signs of damage to healthy brain tissue. Since the introduction of methotrexate, a powerful chemotherapy drug showing great beneficial effects, experts have debated the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of people with PCNSL. Radiotherapy could be combined with chemotherapy, or not used at all, especially considering its potentially harmful effects. 
Review question: The aim of this review was to find any scientific studies of high quality that focus on the effectiveness and harmful effects of radiotherapy in the treatment of PCNSL. A broad search of all relevant databases produced 556 references regarding this topic. Only one study fulfilled the strict inclusion criteria and was thus analysed in detail. 
Study characteristics: We searched all databases for relevant studies published between January 1950 and February 2014. We included only one study that enrolled 551 participants and treated one half with methotrexate followed by WBR, and the other half with methotrexate alone. If participants in the latter group did not respond sufficiently to methotrexate alone, another drug, cytarabine, was given. Participants of a minimum of 18 years of age were enrolled at 75 centres in Germany between May 2000 and May 2009. 
Key results: When we analysed the data regarding the effect of chemotherapy plus WBR or chemotherapy alone on overall survival, the results were imprecise and either treatment could have been superior to the other. Another outcome we considered in addition to overall survival was progression‐free survival (PFS), a state in which the disease does not get any worse. The addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy had a positive effect on PFS, slightly extending the period in which the disease did not progress in comparison to that acheived with chemotherapy alone. The authors did not analyse treatment‐related mortality. We also looked at whether treatment resulted in any damage to healthy brain tissue during treatment. We found no evidence that treatment‐related symptoms of brain function impairment were more common in the group of participants receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy than in those receiving chemotherapy alone.
