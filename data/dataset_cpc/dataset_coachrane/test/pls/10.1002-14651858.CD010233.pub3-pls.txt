Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine for the maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in Crohn’s disease 
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues (azathioprine (AZA) and 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP)) used for maintaining remission following surgery in people with Crohn's disease (CD). 
What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. The disease is known to constantly change from periods when sufferers have symptoms (relapse) to periods when the symptoms disappear (remission) for a short time. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut. However, their symptoms can return after a short time. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease are free from symptoms for as long as possible. However, there are concerns about possible side effects that may arise. Purine analogues (AZA and 6‐MP) are a group of immunosuppressive drugs which have been used for over five decades to manage Crohn's disease. We researched whether purine antimetabolites can maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease after the diseased portion of their gut has been removed. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review authors found 10 relevant studies with a total of 928 participants, conducted across several European countries, Israel and the US. The studies included people with Crohn's disease over 16 years of age who had undergone surgery and were free from symptoms. These studies compared purine analogues with placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), or oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) formulations or with anti‐tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (anti‐TNF‐α) drugs. 5‐ASA and anti‐TNF‐ɑ drugs are used reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut. 
One study was high quality, while six studies were of lower quality and three studies did not report enough information to make a judgement on quality. Purine analogues are probably better than placebo for maintaining surgically‐induced remission of Crohn's disease (moderate certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine antimetabolites to 5‐ASA medications found no difference in the number of people who remained in remission. However, more people who received purine analogues experienced serious side effects or discontinued treatment due to side effects than those who received 5‐ASA (very low and low certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine analogues to anti‐TNF‐α drugs showed that purine analogues were less effective for maintaining remission of Crohn's disease after surgery. However, the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Well designed studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues compared with anti‐TNF‐ɑ agents and other active drugs used for Crohn's disease. Due to sparse data and inconsistent reporting across all studies, the effect of purine analogues on side effects compared with placebo, 5‐ASA or biologics was uncertain. Commonly reported side effects across the studies included leucopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood), pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas), arthralgia (joint pain), abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, anaemia (low number of red blood cells), nasopharyngitis (common cold) and flatulence (intestinal gas). 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 31 July 2019.
Conclusions 
There is moderate certainty evidence that AZA and 6‐MP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in participants with Crohn's disease. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with 5‐ASA agents, however this was based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6‐MP are more likely to result in more serious side effects and withdrawals due to side effects when compared to 5‐ASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti‐TNF‐α agents for preventing relapse, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further research investigating the benefits and harms of AZA and 6‐MP in comparison to other active medications in surgically‐induced remission of CD is warranted.
