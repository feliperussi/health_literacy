Reducing the number of fetuses for women with a multiple pregnancy
What is the issue? 
Women expecting twins, triplets or more, face a higher risk of complications. There are increased risks to the woman, and to their babies, during pregnancy, birth and afterwards. For example, the babies are more likely to die before or after birth, to be born preterm, or to have serious and sometimes long‐lasting difficulties. It is possible to reduce the number of fetuses during pregnancy by terminating one or more of them. This is called pregnancy reduction or fetal reduction. This intervention aims to improve the health of the remaining fetus or fetuses. Parents and healthcare providers need evidence that shows clearly whether reducing the number of fetuses leads to better outcomes, and what the risks may be. 
Why is this important? 
Pregnancy reduction is a very difficult decision for parents. Parents need a full picture of the possible outcomes. Without studies to show if termination is likely to benefit the remaining fetus or fetuses, and what the risks may be, it is harder to make a fully‐informed choice. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies for this Cochrane review (search date 31 July 2015) and so we do not know if the baby or babies who remain after fetal reduction have better outcomes or if there are any risks in the procedure. Evidence from other types of studies does exist but there are problems with making sense of the data. 
What does this mean? 
For the present, we cannot be sure whether pregnancy reduction does lead to better outcomes for the remaining fetuses, and by how much. We cannot be sure which particular outcomes improve, and what risks may arise. In the future, we may get a better picture, with a different type of study which takes into account parental preference, and which tracks the results. In the meantime, parents can come to a decision about whether they want the option of pregnancy reduction after discussion with their midwives and doctors. The discussion will take into account how acceptable the parents find the intervention, and what outcomes they are hoping to achieve.
