Etomidate for sedating critically ill people during emergency endotracheal intubation
Review question 
Does a single dose of etomidate increase mortality or complications in people who are critically ill and undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation? 
Background 
People who are critically ill often need help breathing. One way to do this is called endotracheal intubation. This involves placing a tube into the windpipe (trachea) and having a ventilator (breathing machine) help the patient breathe. 
People are often given sedative agents during endotracheal intubation to make them unaware of the procedure. Many sedative agents cause a potentially harmful drop in blood pressure. 
Etomidate is commonly used to sedate patients before endotracheal intubation because it has minimal effects on blood pressure. However, when someone is given etomidate their adrenal glands do not function as well. This may be harmful to them. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at the evidence up to February 2013 and found 1666 studies. We included eight studies in our review and seven studies (involving 772 patients) in our meta‐analysis. The studies involved people who were in an unstable condition and critically ill. They were given one dose of etomidate or another sedative agent for endotracheal intubation. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. 
Results 
No strong evidence exists to suggest that etomidate, when compared to other bolus dose induction agents, increases mortality in critically ill patients. We must be careful in interpreting this finding because only large studies would be able to show a difference in mortality. So far, no such study has been completed. 
Etomidate does seem to impair adrenal gland functioning. Functioning is impaired most between four and six hours after etomidate is given. 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are used to find out how badly someone’s organs are failing. Using etomidate results in worse SOFA scores but this difference is small and not clinically meaningful. 
The effects of impaired adrenal gland functioning and higher SOFA scores on people’s health is unknown. Using etomidate does not seem to increase the length of time someone is in hospital (including an intensive care unit), the length of time a person is connected to a mechanical ventilator (a machine to assist with breathing), or the use of vasopressors (medicines to increase blood pressure). 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. This is mainly because some small studies we looked at did not check up on people adequately after they were intubated. 
Most people that were involved in one study were intubated because they were in a coma. These people comprise 42% of those involved in the studies we looked at. People in a coma are unlike other critically ill people because they may not benefit to the same extent from having stable blood pressure during endotracheal intubation, which etomidate provides, nor are they at high risk from impaired adrenal gland function compared to other critically ill patients, for example those with severe infection.
