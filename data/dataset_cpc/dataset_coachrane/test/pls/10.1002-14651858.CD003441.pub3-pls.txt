'As required' medication for seriously mentally ill people in hospital
Review question 
This review attempts to find evidence to find out whether the use of 'as required' medication is good clinical practice or not, when compared to the same drug given regularly, for people with schizophrenia who are in hospital. Searches for randomised trials investigating this question have been run by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2001, 2006, 2012 and 2013. 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions) that can be upsetting or frightening, or both. These symptoms of schizophrenia can cause agitation, aggression and distress. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs usually take several weeks to work. In the meantime, for people in distress in hospital, other additional medication can be given when needed (if clinicians think it is appropriate), until regular antipsychotics start to work. This 'as required' medication is often used to help people feel less anxious and to reduce disturbed behaviour. 'As required' medication is usually written on the drug chart by the clinician so that nurses can administer it at their discretion and in the doctor's absence. Although there are many advantages to this practice, there are also potential disadvantages. For example, it may cause difficulty in knowing which medication (the prescribed medication or the 'as required' medication) has been effective and staff on the ward might use this additional medication too readily for individuals who are upset, rather than spending time with them or considering other approaches. 
Study characteristics 
The search only found trials that compared two different drugs, both of which were used 'as required'. The review authors found no trials that compared only giving additional medication when needed with regular doses of the same medication. 
Key results 
The review authors found no trials that could be included in the review. Although the practice of using medication 'as required' is common, there is currently no good evidence as to whether this is the best way of helping people when compared to them being given a regular dose of the same medication. 
Quality of the evidence 
The review authors found no trials that compared 'as required' with regular medication. 'As required' medication, though used widely, has not been evaluated scientifically. A well designed, conducted and reported randomised trial would help to gather more evidence.
