Preparing the cervix with different ripening agents before operative hysteroscopy
Review question
Are cervical ripening agents effective for dilating the cervix before operative hysteroscopy and do they reduce the risk of complications during the surgery? 
Background
Hysteroscopy is an operation in which the gynaecologist examines the uterine cavity using a small telescope (hysteroscope) inserted via the vagina and the cervix. Potential complications of hysteroscopy include cervical tears, formation of a false passage and uterine perforation. Cervical ripening agents are used with the aim of making it easier for the hysteroscope to pass through the cervix and reducing the risk of complications. Ripening agents include different types of prostaglandins (for example misoprostol and dinoprostone) which are administered either orally or vaginally. Osmotic agents are also used, and are administered vaginally. One osmotic agent is laminaria, a sea‚Äêweed based product. Cochrane reviewers assessed the evidence about different ripening agents. The evidence is current to August 2014. 
Study characteristics
We included 19 randomised controlled trials (1870 participants) of premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopic surgery for a variety of conditions. They compared misoprostol with placebo or no treatment, dinoprostone, and osmotic agents. 
Key results
There is moderate quality evidence that misoprostol is safer and is more effective for cervical ripening than placebo or no treatment, and that is associated with fewer complications occurring during the operation, with lower rates of lacerations and false tracks. However misoprostol is associated with more side effects such as preoperative pain and vaginal bleeding. 
There is low quality evidence that misoprostol may be safer and more effective than dinoprostone, and that it may be associated with fewer complications occurring during the operation. There is also low quality evidence that laminaria may be more effective than misoprostol. However, the possible benefits of laminaria need to be weighed against the inconvenience of its insertion and retention for one to two days.
