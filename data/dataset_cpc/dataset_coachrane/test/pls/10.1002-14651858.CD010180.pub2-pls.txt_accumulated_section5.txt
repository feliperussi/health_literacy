Endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate glue versus other endoscopic procedures for acute bleeding gastric varices in people with portal hypertension 
Background 
Acute bleeding from ruptured gastric varices (enlarged veins), the most severe consequence of portal hypertension (that is increased pressure in the veins leading to the liver), is associated with high death rates. The most promising treatment for this condition is considered to be endoscopic sclerotherapy (passing a flexible tube with a camera at the end down the oesophagus (swallowing tube) allowing direct visualisation and treatment of bleeding varices) with N‐butyl‐2‐cyanoacrylate (cyanoacrylate), which is a glue that causes blood clots to form and stops the bleeding. However, incidence of re‐bleeding and complications have opened a debate on when this glue should be used compared with other endoscopic procedures. 
Characteristic of included studies 
This review includes six trials (following search of scientific databases through to September 2014) of three different comparisons regarding the use of cyanoacrylate: comparison of different dosages of cyanoacrylate (one trial, 91 participants), cyanoacrylate compared with alcohol‐based compounds (one trial, 37 participants), and cyanoacrylate compared with endoscopic band ligation (where enlarged veins are tied off using elastic bands; four trials, 366 participants). Risk of bias (that is overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) was high in all trials. Outcomes assessed included death, bleeding‐related death, treatment failure, re‐bleeding, side effects, and bleeding control. Follow‐up of people varied from six to 26 months. All people included in these trials had chronic liver disease of different severities and were predominantly men. Most of the trials came from Eastern countries, although it must be noted that prevalence of chronic liver disease is fairly similar worldwide, with differences in causes that may have no effect on variceal bleeding.
