Early versus delayed initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for respiratory distress in preterm infants 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether for preterm infants in respiratory distress, applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) early would result in increased benefit and less harm than if it were applied later. 
Background 
Preterm babies often lack surfactant, a detergent‐like substance produced by the lung. Lack of surfactant causes their lungs to fail to expand properly at birth and results in the need for greater effort in breathing. If left untreated, the breathing difficulty progressively worsens and may lead to lung damage. CPAP improves expansion of the lung, making it easier for the baby to breathe, and might reduce the need for intermittent positive‐pressure ventilation (IPPV), a form of respiratory support that carries greater risks, including the risk of developing a type of lung damage called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP). CPAP might also reduce the risk of the baby dying from respiratory distress. CPAP is applied through a face mask, a nasal mask, or prongs into the nostrils. 
Study characteristics 
The search is up‐to‐date as of June 2020. We found four small studies including a total of 119 babies. All four studies were performed in the 1970s or early 1980s, when the use of antenatal steroids (given to the mother to help a preterm baby's lung to become more mature) was uncommon. 
Key results 
From these four small studies, we are very uncertain whether early CPAP provides any benefit or whether it causes any harm. 
Certainty of evidence 
All four included studies had weaknesses in the way they were conducted, and all were very small. In addition, because they were old studies, study results might not apply to the current care of preterm infants. Therefore, we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low.
