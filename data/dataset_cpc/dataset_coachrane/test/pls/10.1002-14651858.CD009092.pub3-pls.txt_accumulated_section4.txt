Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis
Diverticulitis is a condition with inflammation of the so‐called diverticulae. A diverticulae is a weakness in the bowel wall. Diverticulae are common in the population, especially in the elderly above the age of 60 years, and are often asymptomatic. Diverticulitis may present as abdominal pain and tenderness accompanied by signs of infection, such as fever. In most cases, diverticulitis resolves without complications, however, some patients develop complications and may need emergency surgery. 
Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is the focus of this review. It has traditionally been regarded as an infection with bacterial overgrowth in the large intestine and has been treated with antibiotics. Recently, it has been argued that diverticulitis is more likely to be an inflammatory rather than an infectious condition, making the use of antibiotics questionable. Consequently, a shift towards the use of therapeutic regimens without antibiotics has been seen. This present review investigates whether there is any existing clinical evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. 
Five clinical trials in hospitalised patients were assessed. One trial investigated two different antibiotic treatments and a second study investigated the duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Three trials investigated the actual need for antibiotics when compared to no antibiotics of which two trials had published long‐term follow‐up results as separate records. None of the studies found a statistical difference in the tested antibiotic regimens. Comparing no antibiotic versus antibiotic treatment did not demonstrate any differences in the occurrence of complications like abscesses and perforations of the large intestine, or in the need for emergency surgery.
