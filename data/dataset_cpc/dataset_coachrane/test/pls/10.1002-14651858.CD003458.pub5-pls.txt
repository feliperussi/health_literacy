Drug and nutritional treatment for McArdle disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of drug and nutritional treatment for McArdle disease. 
Background 
McArdle disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type V) is a disorder affecting muscle metabolism. The condition is caused by the lack of an enzyme called muscle phosphorylase. This results in an inability to break down glycogen 'fuel' stores. McArdle disease leads to pain and fatigue with strenuous exercise. Sometimes severe muscle damage develops and occasionally this results in acute reversible kidney failure. 
Study characteristics 
After a wide search, we identified 13 randomised studies that included 85 participants with McArdle disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2004. We found no new trials at this update. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
The review found no benefit compared with placebo with the following treatments: D‐ribose, glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, oral branched chain amino acids, dantrolene sodium, high‐dose creatine and ramipril. Low dose creatine and ramipril produced minimal benefit for patients who also have the D/D angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) phenotype. Taking low dose creatine supplements had a minor benefit in improving exercise tolerance in a small number of people with the condition. Taking a sugary drink before planned strenuous exercise can improve performance but this treatment is not practical for day‐to‐day living. A diet rich in carbohydrate may be superior to a diet rich in protein. Adverse effects were reported in four studies. Oral ribose caused symptoms suggestive of a low blood sugar including light‐headedness, hunger and diarrhoea. One study of branched chain amino acids resulted in a deterioration in participants. Dantrolene was reported to cause a number of side‐effects including tiredness, sleepiness, dizziness and muscle weakness. Low dose creatine (60 mg/kg/day) did not cause any side‐effects but high‐dose creatine (150 mg/kg/day) worsened the symptoms of muscle pain. The quality of these studies was low due to the small number of participants; the largest number in one trial was 19 and one trial had only one participant. 
The evidence is current to August 2014.
