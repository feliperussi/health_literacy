Combined spinal‐epidural versus epidural analgesia in labour
Regional analgesia has been shown to be effective in providing pain relief in labour. Regional analgesia can be an epidural, a spinal or a combination of the two. An epidural is when the pain‐relieving drugs are injected into the part of the body which surrounds the spinal column (epidural space). It is most common for these drugs to be infused through a very fine tube (catheter) positioned in the epidural space. Traditionally, high concentrations of local anaesthetic drugs were used. These numbed the woman from the waist downwards giving pain relief for most women. However, it also caused leg weakness, poor mobility and difficulty for the mother giving birth. This led to increased instrumental vaginal births with subsequent increased bruising, pain and incontinence later on for the mother. More recently with epidurals, low‐dose local anaesthetic drugs have been used in combination with opioid drugs. Here there is less numbing of the woman's legs but the opioid drugs cross the placenta and may make the baby sleepy. 
A spinal is when the analgesic drugs are injected directly into the fluid surrounding the nerves in the spinal column and is quicker to take effect than an epidural. However, because a single spinal injection is only effective for a short period of time, they are not commonly used on their own for pain relief in labour. Also, the use of very fine catheters in the spinal space has been associated with increased injury to nerves. Hence, the combination of a single spinal injection combined with the use of an epidural catheter for ongoing pain relief was developed. This combined spinal‐epidural was thought to have the benefits of being quicker to provide pain relief but with no change to the incidence or severity of side effects for the mother or baby. 
This review of trials compared CSE with traditional and with low‐dose epidurals. There were 27 trials, involving 3274 women. The data showed no difference in the mothers' satisfaction between CSE and epidurals. However, CSEs had a slightly faster onset of effective pain relief, but more women itched than with low‐dose epidurals. There was no difference seen for mobility in labour, headaches, caesarean section or adverse effects for the baby. Any differences for rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis remain unknown. There appears to be little difference overall between these techniques.
