Interventions for unexplained infertility: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Review question Researchers in Cochrane reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of ovarian stimulation (OS), intrauterine insemination (IUI), OS‐IUI, and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) versus expectant management in couples with unexplained infertility. 
Background Treatment options for unexplained infertility include expectant management as well as active treatments such as ovarian stimulation (OS), intrauterine insemination (IUI), OS‐IUI,  and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Network meta‐analysis synthesises evidence of direct and indirect comparisons of interventions and enables researchers to simultaneously assess the effectiveness of more than two interventions for the same condition, so that clinicians can use the evidence to offer the best treatment. Therefore, we compared all these different treatment options by using network meta‐analysis, to better inform clinical decision‐making. 
Study characteristics We found 27 randomised controlled trials comparing these treatments with each other in a total of 4349 couples with unexplained infertility. The evidence is current to September 2018. 
Key results Evidence of differences in live birth between expectant management and the other four treatments (OS, IUI, OS‐IUI, and IVF/ICSI) was insufficient. If the chance of live birth following expectant management is assumed to be 17%, the chance following OS, IUI, OS‐IUI, and IVF would be 9% to 28%, 11% to 33%, 15% to 37%, and 14% to 47%, respectively. Compared to expectant management/IUI, OS may increase the chances of multiple pregnancy, and OS‐IUI probably increases the chances of multiple pregnancy. Evidence showing differences between IVF/ICSI and expectant management for multiple pregnancy was insufficient. If the chance of multiple pregnancy following expectant management/IUI is assumed to be 1%, the chance following OS, OS‐IUI, and IVF/ICSI would be 1% to 5%, 1% to 5%, and 0% to 6%, respectively. 
Certainty of the evidence The certainty of evidence overall was low to moderate. The main limitations were imprecision (not enough couples have been studied) and heterogeneity (couples in existing studies had different clinical characteristics).
