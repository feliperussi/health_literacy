Improving healthcare workers' use of Standard Precautions to decrease infection in healthcare settings 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out what strategies can be used to improve how well healthcare workers follow a system of actions known as 'Standard Precautions' to decrease infection in healthcare settings. 
Key messages 
Review authors identified a variety of strategies, most of which involved education of healthcare workers alone or with an additional strategy. It is unclear which strategy or combination of strategies is most effective for improving healthcare workers' adherence to Standard Precautions or their knowledge of Standard Precautions, or for reducing colonisation (potential infection) rates, as we found little evidence; this fact, along with the inconsistency of results, reduced our confidence or certainty about the evidence found. 
What was studied in the review? 
It is estimated that over four million patients in Europe and 1.7 million in the USA develop an infection each year, and that prevalence is higher in developing countries. Infection is associated with increased length of hospital stay, excess mortality, and billions of dollars in associated hospital costs. Adhering to Standard Precautions, such as using personal protective equipment or following practices for safe handling of needles, can reduce the spread of germs in healthcare settings. The aim of this review was to find out which methods are effective in improving healthcare workers' adherence to Standard Precautions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Review authors found eight relevant studies with a total of 673 participants. Three studies were reported from Asia, two from Europe, two from North America, and one from Australia. Intevention strategies consisted of education for healthcare workers, given alone or with other types of education, such as showing how respiratory droplets are spread, or with additional infection control supports. Other intervention strategies were peer evaluation and use of a checklist and coloured cues. All studies used different measures to assess how well healthcare workers followed or adhered to Standard Precautions. Two studies also assessed whether there was any improvement in healthcare workers' knowledge (of Standard Precautions), and one measured rates of colonisation of MRSA (carriage of MRSA with increased potential for infection) among residents and staff of long‚Äêterm care facilities
