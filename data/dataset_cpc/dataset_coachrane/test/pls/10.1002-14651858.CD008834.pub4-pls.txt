Are anti‚Äêblood clotting drugs beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease?
What is the issue?People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of heart disease that can block the blood supply to the heart or brain causing a heart attack or stroke. Drugs that prevent blood clots from forming (antiplatelet agents) can prevent deaths caused by clots in arteries in the general adult population. However, there may be fewer benefits for people who have CKD, because blood clots in arteries is a less common cause of death or reason to be admitted to hospital compared with heart failure or sudden death in these people. People with CKD also have an increased tendency for bleeding due to changes in how the blood clots. Antiplatelet agents may therefore be more hazardous when CKD is present. 
What did we do? 
This updated review evaluated the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents to prevent cardiovascular disease and death, and the impact on dialysis vascular access (fistula or graft) function in people who have CKD. We identified 90 studies comparing antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment and 29 studies directly comparing one antiplatelet agent with another. 
What did we find?Antiplatelet agents probably prevent heart attacks, but do not clearly reduce death or stroke. Treatment with these agents may increase the risk of major and minor bleeding. Clotting of dialysis access was prevented with antiplatelet agents. 
ConclusionsThe benefits of antiplatelet agents for people with CKD is probably limited to the prevention of a heart attack. The treatment does not appear to prevent stroke or death and probably incurs excess serious bleeding that may require hospital admission or transfusion.
