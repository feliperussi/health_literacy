Medications to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): a review of the evidence
Who may be interested in this review? 
‐ People affected by PTSD and their families. ‐ Professionals working in adult mental health services. ‐ General practitioners. ‐ Charities that support victims of trauma or members of the armed forces. 
Why is this review important? 
PTSD is a condition experienced by some people after traumatic experiences such as warfare or domestic violence. People with PTSD experience symptoms of intense fear, helplessness and horror. Research suggests that changes in stress hormones in the brain may contribute to PTSD. Giving people medications which work in the brain soon after traumatic events may be able to prevent PTSD from developing. 
Previous reviews have shown that talking therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy ‐ CBT) is effective in preventing PTSD. This is the first review of medication as a preventative treatment for PTSD. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
‐ Is medication an effective preventative treatment for PTSD compared to placebo (dummy pills)? ‐ Is medication an acceptable treatment (do people stop medication due to side effects)? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases to find all studies comparing medication with placebo for the prevention of PTSD, published up until February 2014. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials. Studies were included if they had adult participants aged over 18 who had experienced traumatic events but did not have a diagnosis of PTSD at the time of starting medication. 
We included nine studies with a total of 345 participants in the review. Seven out of the nine studies had a high risk of bias due to problems with the research design. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There was moderate quality evidence that hydrocortisone (a steroid medication) prevented PTSD. 
There was moderate quality evidence that hydrocortisone reduced the severity of PTSD symptoms. 
There was no evidence that propranolol (a beta‐blocker), escitalopram (a type of antidepressant), temazepam (a tranquillizer) or gabapentin (an anticonvulsant) prevented PTSD.
