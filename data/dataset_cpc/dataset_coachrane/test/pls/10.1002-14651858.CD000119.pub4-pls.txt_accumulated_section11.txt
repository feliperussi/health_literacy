Which types of blood‐thinning drugs (anticoagulants) are best to prevent blood clots in people soon after stroke? 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out which type of blood‐thinning drug works best for preventing blood clots in people who have recently had a stroke due to blockage of an artery in the brain. 
Background 
Stroke is a common and disabling disease. Sudden blockage of an artery to the brain, often caused by a blood clot, is the cause of the most common type of stroke. This type is called an ischaemic stroke. Anticoagulants (blood‐thinning drugs), are widely used in people with stroke. As stroke is a medical emergency, and medicines given in an emergency need to reach the bloodstream quickly, these are given by injection. Injectable anticoagulants that have been tested in stroke are unfractionated heparin (UFH), low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWH), and heparinoids. These agents may help clear blocked arteries, prevent re‐blockage, and prevent clots forming in leg veins (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) after an ischaemic stroke and so might prevent fatal or disabling complications of stroke and improve the chance of a good recovery. However, they can also cause harmful bleeding complications that can offset any benefits.

Study characteristics 
We looked for randomised controlled trials in people with recent onset of stroke symptoms that compared LMWH or heparinoids with UFH. 
Key results 
We found nine trials involving 3137 participants; overall these trials had a moderate risk of bias (this means that the results are likely to be less credible than if the risk of bias was low). No new trials were included in this updated review. None of the studies reported reliable information on disability or recovery after stroke. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (quality of the evidence was low). Although LMWH or heparinoid were associated with significantly fewer clots in leg veins (DVT) than UFH, the number of major events such as when a blood clot becomes lodged in an artery in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and bleeding inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhages) was too small to know whether the harms outweighed the benefits. For people with ischaemic stroke who need immediate treatment with anticoagulants, evidence from the included clinical trials did not provide reliable evidence on the balance of risk and benefit for each type of heparin. Additional large scale research would be needed to resolve this uncertainty.
