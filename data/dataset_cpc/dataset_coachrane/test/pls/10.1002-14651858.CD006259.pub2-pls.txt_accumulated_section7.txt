Mitomycin C versus 5‐Fluorouracil for wound healing in glaucoma surgery
Review question  Does mitomycin C (MMC) offer any advantage in comparison to 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU) as the antimetabolite used to augment glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy)? Does MMC help to achieve lower rates of trabeculectomy failure than 5‐FU at one year postoperatively? 
Background  Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) to help lower intraocular pressure. Antimetabolites are medicines used during surgery to help reduce scarring after surgery during wound healing. If scarring occurs it can lead to treatment failure because the drainage channel no longer works. Two agents in common use are MMC and 5‐FU. 
Search date  The evidence is up to date to October 2015. 
Study characteristics  We included 11 randomised controlled trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa in this review. In total, 687 eyes of 679 participants underwent routine trabeculectomy for glaucoma control. Some participants were at a higher risk of failure than others, for example if they had had previous glaucoma surgery, were of African origin, or if they had secondary glaucoma. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
Key results  Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was slightly less in those participants treated with MMC compared to 5‐FU. All of the included randomised controlled trials contributed to this result, with a mixed study population of high‐ and low‐risk participants and varied methodology of antimetabolite application. We did not detect any significant differences between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure, but the power of this analysis was low. 
We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the group that received MMC and the group that received 5‐FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively. However, we found evidence to suggest that MMC was more effective at lowering intraocular pressure than 5‐FU in both high‐ and low‐risk participants, achieving a lower mean intraocular pressure postoperatively than in those who were treated with 5‐FU at one year. This effect seemed to be greater in the high‐risk populations.
