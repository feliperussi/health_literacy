Use of gloves, a gown or a mask for contact with hospitalised patients with Staphylococcus aureus resistant to a common antibiotic (MRSA) 
What is MRSA, and why is it a problem in hospitals? 
MRSA stands for 'meticillin‐ (or methicillin‐) resistant Staphylococcus aureus'. This is a common type of bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) that is no longer killed by meticillin (also known as 'methicillin', an antibiotic) or other antibiotics that are frequently used to treat infections. MRSA can live on people without making them ill, and without them showing any symptoms, but is dangerous when it infects people who are unwell. 
MRSA is easily transferred from one patient to another in hospitals, where it causes severe infections and can cause death. This transmission occurs mainly through healthcare workers when their hands, clothes, or equipment become contaminated with MRSA during routine care of patients who have MRSA. Later contact of the contaminated hands, clothes or equipment with other patients allows MRSA to spread within the hospital. 
Why might use of gloves, gowns or masks help prevent transmission of MRSA between patients in hospitals? 
It is possible that the use of disposable gloves with or without the use of disposable or washable gowns could prevent transmission of MRSA, as they would protect the healthcare workers' hands and clothes from becoming contaminated with MRSA. The gloves and gowns would be discarded after one patient had been cared for, and clean ones used to visit the next patient. The use of masks might also prevent spread of MRSA through the air. 
It is not known whether use of gloves, gowns or masks reduces the spread of MRSA when they are used individually, or whether combining two of the three, or all three, produces better results.
