Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results.
