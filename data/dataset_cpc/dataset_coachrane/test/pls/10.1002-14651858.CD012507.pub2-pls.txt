Communication training for parents of preschool children with motor disorders
Background 
Children with movement disorders, such as cerebral palsy, often have difficulty producing speech and gesture. This can make their communication difficult to understand. In the preschool years, speech and language therapy often involves training parents to recognise their child's communication signals and promote communication development. 
Review question 
Does communication training for parents (parent‐mediated communication intervention) of preschool children with movement disorders improve the communication between children and parents? We were also interested in whether the training had any unintended consequences, whether it had an effect on parents' levels of stress and coping, and whether parents were satisfied with the training and complied with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to July 2017. We found only two studies that reported the effects of parent communication training; one study took place at an intervention centre in Canada, the other in South Korea. The studies involved 38 children (20 boys, 18 girls), aged 15 to 96 months, and their mothers. Both studies compared parent communication training with no intervention for communication problems. Mothers attended eight group training sessions 11 to 12 weeks with two or three home visits. The studies involved children with a range of developmental difficulties; most had intellectual disability, 10 had movement disorders (cerebral palsy). However, the extent to which children's movement disorder affected their communication was not clear; all children appeared to have good use of their hands for gesture and pointing, and impairment of speech was not reported. 
Results were assessed immediately after training. We found no report of results at a later date (longer‐term follow‐up). 
Key results and the quality of the evidence 
In the two small studies, it appears that mothers may have responded more frequently to their child's interaction following parent‐mediated communication training. However, there was no associated reduction in mothers' directiveness (such as their use of commands) in conversation and no change in maternal stress. For the children, we found no evidence for change in children's initiation of conversation or of joint attention in interaction with others. Studies did not report any negative effects of training, mothers' adherence to guidance within the training or the acceptability of the programmes. 
We were not able to evaluate the effects of parent‐mediated communication intervention and frequency of children's communication, their use of spoken language in conversation with their parents, their speech production or their language development because the data were not available. We have no reports of children's development of individual communication skills, such as learning to ask questions, and no reports of defects of the intervention on their generic participation or harms arising from the intervention. Finally, we found no reports of maternal satisfaction with the treatment. 
We judged the evidence from the included studies to be of very low quality because of issues with study design and a lack of detail in the results presented, and because it was not clear whether children's movement disorders affected their communication. 
Research with larger numbers of families of children whose movement disorders affect their speech and gesture is needed, to test whether communication training for parents can help them to promote the communication development of their young children with movement disorders.
