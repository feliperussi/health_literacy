Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older
Review question 
This is the second update of this review, first published in 1998 and first updated in 2009. We wanted to study the benefits and harms of using blood pressure‐lowering drugs in adults 60 years or older with raised blood pressure. 
Search date 
We searched the available medical literature to find all trials that compared drug treatment versus placebo or no treatment to examine this question. Data included in this review are up‐to‐date as of November 2017. 
Background 
High blood pressure, which is common among elderly people 60 years or older, increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 studies that randomly assigned 26,795 patients 60 years or older with high blood pressure to antihypertensive drug therapy or to placebo or untreated control for a mean duration of 4.5 years. 
Key results 
Blood pressure‐lowering drug therapy in people with hypertension 60 years and older reduced death, strokes, and heart attacks. Benefit was similar if both upper and lower blood pressure numbers were elevated and if only the upper number was elevated. First‐line treatment used in most studies was a thiazide. More patients withdrew from the studies owing to side effects of these drugs. The magnitude of benefit in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity observed was probably greater among 60‐ to 79‐year‐old patients than in very elderly patients 80 years or older. 
Conclusions 
Blood pressure‐lowering drug treatment for healthy persons (60 years or older) with raised blood pressure reduces death, heart attacks, and strokes. 
Quality of evidence 
Review authors graded the quality of evidence as high for reduction in death and as moderate for reduction in stroke and heart attacks.
