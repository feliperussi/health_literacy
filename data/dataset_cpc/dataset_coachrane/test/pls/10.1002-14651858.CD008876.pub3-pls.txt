Pharmacological agents as symptomatic treatment for memory disorder in people with multiple sclerosis 
This is an update of the Cochrane review "Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis" (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10). 
Background 
Memory disorder is one of the most frequent cognitive impairments (where people have difficulty with thinking, learning and memory) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting an estimated 40% to 60% of people and represents a considerable burden to those people. Data on the use of agents such as donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine, either by mouth (orally) and by other means (parenterally), seemed to provide promising results. The authors of this review tried to assess the extent by which these treatments produced beneficial results (efficacy), whether they had side effects (tolerability) and whether they were safe in adults with all the types of MS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (where participants were randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults with MS. Neither patients nor researchers were told which treatment was given. Doctors had diagnosed MS and memory impairment using standard methods. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Up to July 2013, we found only seven studies with 625 participants that met our requirements although the quality of the included studies was overall low. We did not find convincing evidence to support the use of these drugs as effective symptomatic treatments for memory disorder in people with MS. There was moderate‚Äêquality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was ineffective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory problems, but it was well tolerated. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams, although not frequent, were reported for donepezil, while ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported. 
There is one ongoing study that may ultimately provide valuable evidence in the future updates.
