Vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children 
Review question 
To assess the effects of vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. 
Background 
Nutritional rickets is a disease of the bones that affects mostly children in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Children with nutritional rickets typically have deformed bones, may not grow well and experience other health problems. A lack of vitamin D is the most common cause of nutritional rickets. As such, nutritional rickets is usually treated by giving the child vitamin D with or without calcium. In some sunny countries, however, calcium alone has been used to treat nutritional rickets in children who are believed to have adequate vitamin D from their exposure to sunlight but who lack adequate calcium in their diet. This review was conducted to find out whether vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium is best for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. 
Study characteristics 
We found four randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared vitamin D, calcium or a combination of vitamin D and calcium for the treatment of nutritional rickets in children. The 286 children in the studies were aged six months to 14 years. Following treatment, the children were monitored for between 12 and 24 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 25 July 2019.
Key results 
We found evidence that using calcium alone or vitamin D plus calcium to treat nutritional rickets may improve healing when compared to using vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects on fractures of calcium alone compared to vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects on fractures or other side effects of vitamin D plus calcium compared to vitamin D alone. We are uncertain about the effects of vitamin D plus calcium compared to calcium alone on healing of rickets, fractures and side effects.
