Treatment methods for people with necrotising pancreatitis (pancreatic destruction due to inflammation of pancreas) 
Review question 
How should people with necrotising pancreatitis be treated?
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen (tummy) that secretes several digestive enzymes (substances that enable and speed up chemical reactions in the body) into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also contains the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones including insulin (helps regulate blood sugar). Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation of the pancreas and can lead to destruction of the pancreas (pancreatic necrosis). Pancreatic necrosis can be infected or non‐infected (sterile). Pancreatic necrosis can lead to failure of other organs, such as the lungs and kidneys, and is a life‐threatening illness. The main treatments for pancreatic necrosis include removal of the dead tissue (debridement or necrosectomy), peritoneal lavage (washing dead tissue out of the abdomen, drainage (inserting a tube or 'drain' to drain out the fluid collection around the pancreas), or initial drainage followed by necrosectomy if necessary (called the minimally invasive 'step‐up' approach). The minimally invasive step‐up approach can be performed in different ways. For example, in video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach, necrosectomy is performed after a period of drainage through a key‐hole operation; in the endoscopic minimally invasive step‐up approach, necrosectomy is performed with the help of an endoscope (instrument used to look inside the abdomen). 
The best way to treat people with necrotising pancreatitis is not clear. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) whose results were reported to 7 April 2015. 
Study characteristics 
Eight trials including 311 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review, of whom 306 participants were included in various comparisons. The treatments compared in five trials included necrosectomy, peritoneal lavage, and the step‐up approach. Three other trials compared variations in timing of necrosectomy and methods of step‐up approach. The participants in the trials had infected or sterile pancreatic necrosis resulting from varying causes. 
Key results 
Overall, the short‐term death rate (mortality over a short time) was 30% and serious adverse events (side effects or complications) rate was 139 per 100 participants. The differences in short‐term mortality and percentage of people with serious adverse events were imprecise in all the comparisons. The number of serious adverse events and adverse events were fewer in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy. The complications resulting from the disease and treatment included heart failure (heart does not pump enough blood around the body at the correct pressure), lung failure (lungs do not remove waste products from the blood), kidney failure (kidneys do not remove waste products from the blood), and blood poisoning (micro‐organisms and their poisons are in the blood). The percentage of people with organ failure and the average costs were lower in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy. The number of adverse events were more with the video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to the endoscopic‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach but the total numbers of procedures performed were less with the video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to the endoscopic minimally invasive step‐up approach. The differences in any of the other comparisons for number of serious adverse events, percentage of people with organ failure, number of adverse events, length of hospital stay, and intensive therapy unit stay were either imprecise or were not consistent. None of the trials reported long‐term mortality, infected pancreatic necrosis (in trials that included participants with sterile necrosis), health‐related quality of life (which measures physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning), percentage of people with adverse events, requirement for additional invasive intervention, time to return to normal activity, and time to return to work.
