Cordyceps sinensis (a traditional Chinese medicine) for kidney transplant recipients
Kidney transplant recipients need to take several immunosuppressive drugs following surgery to prevent rejection. However, these drugs can cause side effects which compromise long‐term survival for both patients and grafted kidneys. 
Cordyceps sinensis (Cordyceps) is used in traditional Chinese medicine settings. Cordyceps is thought to suppress organ rejection, reduce immunosuppressive drug use, and protect patients from drug‐related side effects. However, because Cordyceps use is limited beyond settings that routinely treat people using traditional Chinese medicine, its benefits and harms are unclear. 
We evaluated the use of Cordyceps following kidney transplantation to assess its safety, benefits and harms. We searched the literature published to September 2015 and found 156 records. Of these, 131 were from Chinese language databases and 25 from non‐Chinese language sources. After assessment, we included five studies (six reports) that presented data from 447 adult patients who received Cordyceps treatment following kidney transplantation in China. Overall, we found that reporting and study designs were significantly flawed and may have overestimated benefits and underestimated harms. 
Cordyceps was compared with azathioprine (an immunosuppressive drug). We found no significant differences between treatments in terms of patient or kidney survival, or organ rejection. We found some improvement in kidney function, anaemia, leucopenia, liver function and incidence of infection among people who received Cordyceps. 
We also analysed Cordyceps in combination with low dose cyclosporin A (CsA, another immunosuppressive drug) versus standard dose CsA. We found no significant differences in patient or kidney survival, organ rejection, or kidney function between treatments. Cordyceps treatment was reported to lead to a reduction in CsA dose, improved rates of lung infection, albumin and uric acid levels in blood. Cordyceps also appeared to offer protective effects against kidney and liver damage that can occur with use of CsA; however this improvement may also have been due to the lower CsA dose.
