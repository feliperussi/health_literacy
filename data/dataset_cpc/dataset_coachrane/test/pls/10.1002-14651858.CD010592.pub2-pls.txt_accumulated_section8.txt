Intranasal corticosteroids for non‐allergic rhinitis
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether intranasal corticosteroids (steroids applied into the nose) are effective for the treatment of rhinitis that is not caused by allergy. 
Background 
Non‐allergic rhinitis is a chronic disease of the nose, which is not caused by infection or allergies. People with non‐allergic rhinitis experience symptoms that affect their quality of life, such as nasal obstruction, runny nose and sneezing. Non‐allergic rhinitis patients can be divided into different subgroups who have different underlying causes for their disease. The underlying causes of non‐allergic rhinitis are not fully understood, therefore treatment is often unsuccessful in these patients. 
Topical (intranasal) corticosteroids are used with the aim of reducing inflammation. They are the most commonly prescribed drug in other chronic diseases of the nose and sinuses, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Intranasal corticosteroid treatment can be delivered with sprays or drops and for different time periods. 
Study characteristics 
We included 34 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 4452 participants in this review. Most of the studies were relatively small, although the largest study had 983 patients in total. All of the patients were either adults or adolescents (aged between 12 and 18 years old) with non‐allergic rhinitis. The studies looked at a range of types, doses and methods of administration (e.g. spray, drops) of intranasal corticosteroids. Nine studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry or had commercial sponsors. One study was funded by the government. In several studies, the pharmaceutical industry or commercial sponsor may have provided medications, but the funding role was unclear. Funding was not reported in eight studies.
