Skin‐to‐skin care with newborns cuts down procedural pain
Review question: Is skin‐to‐skin care effective in cutting down pain from procedures in newborns? Are there any safety issues? 
Background: Newborns wearing only a diaper being held next to their mother's bare chest is referred to as skin‐to‐skin contact and is also sometimes called 'kangaroo care' because of its similarity to the way kangaroo mothers care for their young. Newborns, especially those who must spend time in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, must have various tests and procedures as part of their care, for example heel stick, venous puncture, and injections. Giving analgesic drugs for these procedures can often pose problems so that alternatives to drugs must be found. 
Study characteristics: Twenty‐eight studies in which newborn babies who were by chance in the kangaroo care group or condition were included from an extensive search of the literature. Skin‐to‐skin care was clearly defined and could have been compared to no pain‐reducing strategies or other pain‐reducing strategies such as sweet taste. Studies were examined which examined well‐established signs of pain, both physiological and behavioural, as well as a combination of physiological and behavioural signs. Different providers of skin‐to‐skin care other than the mother were included. 
Key results: Kangaroo care appears to reduce the pain response to, and recovery from, these frequent procedures, although few studies could be combined to provide strong evidence. As far as it has been reported, skin‐to‐skin care is safe. Although it appears that skin‐to‐skin care is effective, the size of the benefit remains uncertain.
