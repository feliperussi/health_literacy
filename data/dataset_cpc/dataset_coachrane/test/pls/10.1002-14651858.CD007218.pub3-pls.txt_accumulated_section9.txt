Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of any treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). 
Background 
TOS is one of the most controversial diagnoses in medicine. The term TOS represents three related syndromes: a form where the brachial plexus (a collection of nerves in the neck and armpit) is compressed; a form where major blood vessels of the upper chest are compressed; and painful non‐specific or disputed TOS. The person with TOS may have symptoms such as pain in the shoulder and neck that can spread into the arm and front of the chest; weakness; change in sensation; swelling; and a restricted blood supply to the affected arm. The various causes of TOS include an extra rib in the neck, differences in the shape of the bones of the spinal column, abnormal bands of tissue beneath the skin, and abnormalities of how muscles in the side of the neck attach to the bones. TOS is often associated with past injury. 
There is a lack of widely accepted standards for making the diagnosis of TOS, so for the purpose of this review we decided to rely on the diagnosis of TOS made by the investigators in the reviewed studies. TOS is often diagnosed after other causes of one‐sided symptoms of arm pain, weakness, loss of feeling, or all three, have been ruled out. Most people diagnosed with TOS have the disputed form. 
We searched widely for clinical trials of treatments for TOS. We wanted to discover whether any treatment is effective and whether treatments have any harmful effects. 
Study characteristics 
From our systematic search we identified two trials. One trial compared surgery to remove the first rib (transaxillary first rib resection) with surgery in which the surgeon freed the nerves from surrounding tissues (neuroplasty) without removing a rib, in 55 people with the disputed type of TOS. The participants had not responded to non‐surgical treatments. Average follow‐up was 37 months. A second trial analyzed 19 people who underwent double‐blinded provision of a single injection of BTX (muscle relaxant) into the scalene muscles of the neck, and 18 people in the placebo group who received no active injection, with follow‐up at six weeks, three months and, critically for the purpose of this review, six months.
