The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review.

Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results 
Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. 
We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies.
