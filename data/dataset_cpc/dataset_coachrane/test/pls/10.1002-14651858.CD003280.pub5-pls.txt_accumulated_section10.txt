Immune system treatments other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange for CIDP 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for giving people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) treatment that regulates the immune system other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. 
Background 
CIDP is an uncommon disease that causes weakness and numbness of the arms and legs. The condition may progress steadily or have periods of worsening and improvement. The cause is inflammation that damages the insulating layer (myelin) around individual nerve fibres. In severe cases, the disease affects the actual nerve fibres themselves. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, three immune system treatments are known to help. These are corticosteroids ('steroids'), plasma exchange (which removes and replaces blood plasma), and intravenous immunoglobulin (infusions into a vein of human antibodies). However, benefit from these is often inadequate or does not last long. We wanted to discover whether other drugs that suppress or change the activity of the immune system are of benefit. 
Study characteristics 
We found four trials. A trial with 27 participants compared the effects of azathioprine together with steroids to steroids alone for nine months. Azathioprine is a drug that is often used to treat autoimmune diseases because it suppresses the harmful immune cells. This trial had a parallel‐group design, which means that the participants were divided into groups that each received only one of the treatments. 
A cross‐over design trial with 10 participants compared the immune‐regulating drug interferon (IFN) beta‐1a with placebo (dummy treatment) for 12 weeks. The cross‐over design means that all participants received both treatments in random order. A parallel‐group trial with 67 participants also compared interferon beta‐1a with placebo, but for 32 weeks. Another parallel‐group trial with 60 participants compared the cytotoxic drug methotrexate with placebo for 40 weeks. The IFN beta‐1a trials, but not the azathioprine or methotrexate trials, received pharmaceutical company support or sponsorship. 
Key results 
None of these trials showed significant benefit or harm from the drugs. We selected disability scores as our primary measure of the effect of treatment. All the trials were too small to detect or rule out anything but major benefit or harm. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low for IFN beta‐1a and methotrexate because of problems with trial design, and because the small number of participants made the result imprecise. We rated the quality of the evidence for azathioprine as low because of lack of blinding and imprecision. Observational studies of these and other drugs, including the cytotoxic drugs cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, rituximab, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the immune regulating drug interferon (IFN) alfa, exist but are of insufficient quality to determine whether any of these treatments are beneficial.
