Is limiting the amount of fluid given to adults during surgery as good as using haemodynamic monitoring, which continuously measures changes in blood pressure or speed of blood flow inside the arteries, to guide fluid administration? 
Review question 
Our objective was to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether limiting the amount of fluid given to adults during surgery is as good as using haemodynamic monitoring to guide fluid administration. RCTs are clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. Haemodynamic monitoring is continuous, beat‐to‐beat measurement of changes in blood pressure or speed of blood flow inside the arteries. 
Background 
During operations, adults receive additional fluids into their veins (intravenously) to cover their normal needs for fluid and to supplement any fluids lost during surgery because of bleeding, or for other reasons, for example, increased perspiration. It still is not clearly understood how much fluid should be given to adults during surgery. In the past, a lot of fluid was given during operations because it was thought that a large amount of fluid vaporizes during surgery from open cavities, lungs, and skin, and that a lot of fluid is accumulated in operated tissues, and because people require a long fasting time before surgery. Many new studies have disputed these findings, and recently, techniques that use haemodynamic monitoring have been developed to guide doctors on how much fluid is actually necessary during surgery. This technique is called goal‐directed fluid therapy (GDFT). Another concept is that simply giving less fluid than was recommended in the past may confer the same benefit. This technique is called restrictive fluid therapy (RFT). RFT is cheaper and easier to use because it does not require additional equipment.
