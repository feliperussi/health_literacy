iStent for open‐angle glaucoma
What was the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether the implantation of one or more iStent or iStent inject devices ('iStents'), compared with conventional medical, laser, or surgical treatments, can keep people who have primary open‐angle glaucoma from needing to use glaucoma drops (i.e. keep them 'drop‐free'). The glaucoma drops are used to control the fluid pressure within their eyes (called the intraocular pressure (IOP)). We also looked at average change from baseline in number of glaucoma drops needed to control IOP, average change from baseline (i.e. before treatment) in IOP, and health‐related quality of life as defined by study investigators. We examined all outcomes at short‐term (less than six months), medium‐term (six to ≤ 18 months), long‐term (> 18 months and ≤ 36 months) and greater than 36‐month time points. We collected and analyzed all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found seven RCTs evaluating iStents. 
Key messages There was very low‐quality evidence that treatment with iStents may have resulted in higher proportions of people who were drop‐free at medium‐term time points or who had better control of their IOP. None of the seven RCTs examined how the iStent affected quality of life and reporting on complications was highly variable. At present, clinical practice decisions should be based on provider judgment and patient preferences, given inconsistency in results and risk of bias in relevant studies published to date.
