Drains versus no drains after pelvic lymphadenectomy to prevent lymphocyst formation in women with gynaecological cancer 
Background This is an updated version of an original Cochrane review published in Issue 6, 2014. 
Pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph glands found in the pelvis) is an important component of the surgical management of gynaecological cancers to see if the cancer has spread. However, it can lead to complications, especially lymphocyst formation (collection of lymphatic fluid in the pelvis). Lymphocysts can cause leg swelling, blockage of the ureter (a tube that carries urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), pelvic pain, clot formation in the leg and pelvic vein, bowel motility disorder, and infection. Without clear evidence for its effectiveness, placement of suction drains to remove lymphatic fluids that build up in the operative area between the peritoneum and the posterior abdominal wall has been traditionally recommended to prevent such complications. 
Review question The aim of this review was to compare the effects of drains versus no drains in preventing lymphocyst formation following pelvic lymphadenectomy. 
Main findings We updated the main database searches in March 2017. We identified four studies (571 women) for inclusion. The women primarily had cancer of the cervix and endometrium, with only one study also including women with cancer of the ovary. Our findings demonstrated that placement of suction drains is not effective in preventing lymphocysts, especially when the peritoneum (pelvic lining) is left open. In fact, such practice increases the risk of short‐ and long‐term lymphocyst formation with related symptoms.
