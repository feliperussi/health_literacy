Omega‐3 fatty acid addition during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
Do omega‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) taken during pregnancy ‐ either as supplements or as dietary additions in food (such as some types of fish) ‐ improve health outcomes for babies and their mothers? This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2006. 
Why is this important? 
Preterm birth (babies born before 37 weeks pregnancy (gestation)) is a leading cause of disability or death in the first five years of life. Fish and fish oil contain omega‐3 LCPUFA (particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and have been associated with longer pregnancies. So it is suggested that additional omega‐3 LCPUFAs in pregnancy may reduce the number of babies born preterm and may improve outcomes for children and mothers. However, many pregnant women do not eat fish very often. Encouraging pregnant women to eat fatty fish (which generally have low toxin levels) or to use omega‐3 LCPUFA supplements may improve children’s and women's health. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2006. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in August 2018 and found 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; this type of trial provides the most reliable results) (involving 19,927 women). Most trials evaluated a group of women who received omega‐3 LCPUFA and compared them with a group of women who received something that looked like omega‐3 LCPUFA but did not contain it (placebo) or received no omega‐3. The trials were mostly undertaken in upper‐middle or high‐income countries. Some studies included women at increased risk of preterm birth. The quality of the evidence from the included studies ranged from high to very low; this affected the certainty of the findings for different outcomes.
