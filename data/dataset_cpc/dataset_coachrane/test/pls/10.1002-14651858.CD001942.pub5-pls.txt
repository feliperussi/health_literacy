Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy
Review question 
What are the effects of corticosteroids on Bell's palsy?
Background 
Bell's palsy is a paralysis or weakness of muscles in the face, usually on one side, with no certain cause. Symptoms usually recover, although not always. Reducing inflammation of the facial nerve using corticosteroid medicines (steroids) is thought to limit nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010. 
Study characteristics 
We identified seven clinical trials involving 895 people with one‐sided mild, moderate or severe Bell's palsy of unknown cause. All of these trials reported rates of incomplete recovery (the proportion of people left with facial weakness) and we were able to combine the results. People in the studies were aged from 2 to 84 years. They were treated with corticosteroids or placebo (inactive treatment), either alone or in combination with other therapies. One trial only involved children, from 24 months to 74 months old. The duration of the included studies for adults and children ranged from 157 days to 12 months. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Incomplete recovery 
According to moderate quality to high quality evidence, corticosteroids reduced the number of people left with facial weakness after Bell's palsy compared to placebo (a pretend medicine). This finding was based on data from seven studies involving 895 participants with Bell's palsy of varying degrees of severity. We calculated that to stop one person from being left with facial weakness, 10 people need to be treated. 
Five studies provided data on long‐term after‐effects of Bell's palsy following treatment. Two of the studies (75 participants) looked at persistent effects on facial appearance after six months or more. The effect was nearly the same for corticosteroids and placebo, showing that participants who had corticosteroids benefited slightly, although this evidence was low quality. Data from three studies (485 participants) showed clearly that people who received corticosteroids developed less motor synkinesis (unwanted facial movements) and crocodile tears (watery eyes when eating or chewing), compared with people who received placebo alone. This finding was based on moderate‐quality evidence. 
Side effects 
Three studies reported that no side effects could be attributed to corticosteroid treatment. Based on moderate‐quality evidence from three studies (715 participants), numbers experiencing side effects were similar with corticosteroids and placebo. 
The evidence is current to March 2016.
