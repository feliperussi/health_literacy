Oral antiplatelet therapy for acute ischaemic stroke
Review question 
We wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of oral antiplatelet therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with acute ischaemic stroke to see if oral antiplatelet medicines reduced the number of deaths and improved the long‐term outcomes in survivors. 
Background 
Most strokes are caused by a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain that is usually due to a blood clot (called an ischaemic stroke). Immediate treatment with antiplatelet medicines such as aspirin may prevent new clots from forming and hence improve recovery after stroke. However, antiplatelet medicines may also cause bleeding in the brain, which could offset any benefits. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 11 studies, up to August 2020, for inclusion in the review. These studies included 42,226 participants. Three new trials have been added since the last update. As per the previous version of this review, two studies contributed 96% of the data. Most participants in the review were elderly, with a significant proportion over 70 years of age. Males and females were almost equally represented in the trials. There appeared to be some variation in stroke severity among the included trials. The scheduled duration of treatment varied from five days to three months and the scheduled follow‐up period varied from 10 days to six months. 
Key results 
Aspirin, at a dose of 160 mg to 300 mg daily, started within 48 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, saved lives and reduced the risk of further stroke occurring in the first two weeks. If treatment was started more than 48 hours after onset but within 14 days, the limited evidence from this review and other external data suggest that aspirin is of benefit even starting at this late stage. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 160 mg to 300 mg daily, given orally (or by a tube through the nose and into the stomach or by the rectum in people who cannot swallow) and started within 48 hours of onset of presumed ischaemic stroke, reduced the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke without a major risk of early haemorrhagic complications; long‐term outcomes were improved. Almost all the evidence in this review came from trials of aspirin. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence contributing to these results was generally good.
