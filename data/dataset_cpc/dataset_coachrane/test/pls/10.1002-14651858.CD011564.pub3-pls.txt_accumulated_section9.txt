Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases
Review question 
Is vitamin D supplementation beneficial or harmful for adults with chronic liver diseases?
Background 
The available evidence on vitamin D and chronic liver diseases in adults is inconclusive. The aim of this systematic review (a summary of results of available healthcare trials) was to analyse the benefits and harms of the different forms of vitamin D in people with chronic liver diseases. 
Study characteristics 
Twenty‐seven trials with 1979 adult participants provided data for this review. This review update added 12 trials with 945 participants. The 1979 trial participants were randomly assigned to vitamin D compared with placebo (dummy pill) or no treatment. Eleven trials were conducted in high‐income countries, and 16 trials in middle‐income countries. The age range of the participants was 28 years to 61 years, and on average 44% were women. Ten trials included people with chronic hepatitis C, five trials people with liver cirrhosis, 11 trials people with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial liver transplant recipients. There were no trials including people with chronic hepatitis B or inherited liver diseases. All of the included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Vitamin D administration lasted on average six months, and most trials used the cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) form. 
Funding 
Fourteen trials appeared to be free of vested interest that could bias the trial results. Eleven trials may not have been free of vested interest, as they did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship. Two trials were funded by industry. We found no difference between trials without industry support compared to trials at risk of industry support in our analysis.
