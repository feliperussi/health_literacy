Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in children and adolescents in many countries and is strongly linked to risk of future suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Clinicians working with young people who engage in SH, policy makers, young people who themselves have self‐harmed or may be at risk of doing so, and their families and relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH aimed specifically at children and adolescents. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes, particularly with regards to investigating whether there are specific treatments for children and adolescents who SH which have greater benefit compared to routine care in terms of treatment adherence and improvements in psychological well‐being. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH and presented to clinical services. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. Providing therapeutic assessment may improve attendance at subsequent treatment sessions. Only one therapeutic approach ‐ mentalisation ‐ was associated with a reduction in frequency of repetition of SH. However this effect was only modest and the trial was small, which prevents us from being able to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment. There was no clear evidence of effectiveness for compliance enhancement, individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, home‐based family intervention, or provision of an emergency card, nor was there clear evidence for group therapy for adolescents with a history of multiple episodes of SH. 
What should happen next? 
Therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation. While in a single small study, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy appeared ineffective, further evaluation of this treatment is also desirable given the favourable results found in adults who SH. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.
