The use of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis
What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission.
