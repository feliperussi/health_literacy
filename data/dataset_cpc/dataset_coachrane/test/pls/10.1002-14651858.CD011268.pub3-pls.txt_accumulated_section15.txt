Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression
Why is this review important? 
Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
• Anyone who has experienced winter depression.
• Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression.
• General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists.
• Professionals working in adult mental health services.
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended‐release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. 
What does evidence from the review reveal? 
In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. 
Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.
