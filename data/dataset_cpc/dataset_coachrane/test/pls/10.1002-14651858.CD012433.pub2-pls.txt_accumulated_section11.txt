Oxcarbazepine add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which causes people to have seizures. Most people can control their epilepsy with a single antiepileptic drug. Some people, however, require multiple antiepileptic drugs to control their epilepsy, and are said to have drug‐resistant epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine is an antiepileptic drug and is similar to an older antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine can be taken as an add‐on treatment, alongside other antiepileptic medication, to treat drug‐resistant epilepsy. 
Aim of the review 
This review examined whether oxcarbazepine is tolerable and effective when used alongside other antiepileptic medication by people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy (epilepsy that originates from one area of the brain). 
Results 
We included six clinical trials that investigated oxcarbazepine as an add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. There were 1593 people across the studies and they were aged from 1 month to 65 years. 
People who received oxcarbazepine in addition to their normal antiepileptic medication were more likely to have a 50% or greater reduction in the frequency of their seizures compared to people who were on a control treatment, which is believed to have little or no effect. They were also nearly three times more likely to be free from all seizures than those receiving control treatment. Both of these findings suggest that oxcarbazepine is effective at treating drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. These findings are, however, based on evidence that was of low certainty. This means that we are not confident that the findings that we have reported are accurate. 
People who received oxcarbazepine add‐on treatment were also more likely to withdraw from the studies and were more likely to experience side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness, than people receiving control add‐on treatment. The evidence for treatment withdrawal was of moderate certainty, and this means that we can be fairly confident that this is a true effect. 
Authors' conclusions 
As a result of the low‐certainty evidence, we cannot be sure that oxcarbazepine is an effective add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. Instead, we have concerns about the tolerability of oxcarbazepine because of the increased number of people who withdrew from treatment and who experienced side effects.
