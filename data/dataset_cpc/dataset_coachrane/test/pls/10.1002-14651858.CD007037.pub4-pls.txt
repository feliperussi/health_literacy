Beta‐blockers for children with congestive heart failure
Background 
The term congestive heart failure describes a disorder in which the heart is unable to sufficiently and efficiently pump blood through the body. Depending on the severity of the condition, this causes breathlessness and fatigue due to insufficient oxygen supply, and an accumulation of fluids in tissues and organs. 
In children, congestive heart failure is mainly due to congenital heart defects. Drug treatment, depending on the specific condition, may be used for long‐term control of heart failure, or to bridge the time until corrective surgery. For dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, a disorder with high mortality, heart transplantation remains the only option when drug treatment fails. 
Beta‐blockers have proven beneficial and even life‐saving in adults with congestive heart failure and therefore, are part of the standard treatment. For children, similar benefits could be expected, but beta‐blockers are used, if at all, off‐label (i.e. they are not recommended for children). Since the causes for heart failure are different in children than they are in adults, the main effect and adverse events may differ. Dosing might also have to be specifically adapted for different age groups. 
Study characteristics 
This review summarises and discusses the available information on the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. Seven studies, with a total of 420 children were included in the review. 
Key results 
Beta‐blocker therapy improved heart failure in four small studies with less than 30 participants each, and two larger studies with 80 participants each. However, the largest trial, with 161 participants, did not show a significant effect of the investigated beta‐blocker over placebo. 
None of the studies reported any severe beta‐blocker‐related adverse events, apart from one child who had a heart rhythm disturbance.  
Conclusions 
There were not enough data to recommend or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. However, the current available data suggest that children with heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations are required to establish guidelines for therapy.
