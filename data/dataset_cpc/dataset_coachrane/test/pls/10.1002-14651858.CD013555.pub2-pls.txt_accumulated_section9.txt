The timing of treatment for broken bones in the legs and arms that also have open wounds 
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether the different timings of treatments (antibiotics, wound cleaning and whether to do all the surgery in one operation or more) might affect how well people recover from open long bone fractures. We found very few studies, and they did not provide reliable evidence. 
What is an open fracture? 
Some broken bones include open skin wounds around the break. These are called open fractures and are most common in high impact injuries such as road traffic accidents or falls from a height. In this review, we were interested in the treatment of open fractures of long bones (in the thigh, shin, lower leg, upper arm and forearms). These fractures can be very serious injuries. Because of the open wound, people are at serious risk of infection. A 'deep infection' involves the bone and will require further surgery; it may be limb‐threatening and affect long‐term recovery. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Antibiotics (to fight infection) may be started early (within an hour of injury) or later; they may be given for a short time (until the wound is surgically closed) or a longer time. 
‐ Debridement: surgically removing any dirt, foreign objects, or dead and damaged tissue from inside the wound: this may be done early (within 12 hours of injury) or later. 
‐ Treatment also includes surgery to fix the bone and close the wound (this may involve moving skin or muscle, or both, from another body area to cover the wound). All stages (debridement, fixing the bone, wound closure) may be completed during a single operation or in multiple operations. If this is done in multiple operations, the wound may be closed early (within 72 hours of injury) or later.
