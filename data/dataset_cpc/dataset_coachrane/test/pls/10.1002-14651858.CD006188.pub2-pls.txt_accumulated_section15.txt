Surgery for rheumatoid arthritis in the shoulder
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of one type of surgery for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the shoulder.  Currently, there is a very limited amount of research on the effect of surgical treatments for the shoulder in people with RA.    In this review the researchers were able to find just one study comparing one form of surgery called “augmented subscapularis transposition” to another involving just “subscapularis transposition”. 
The review shows that in people with rheumatoid arthritis in the shoulder; a surgery involving Augmented subscapularis transposition: 
·         may improve your physical function slightly compared to subscapularis transposition alone. 
·         makes no difference in improving your pain compared to subscapularis transposition alone. 
Infections were not reported.
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. 
  
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what kind of surgery have been tried? 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joints, and the joints become swollen, stiff and painful. Usually, the joints of the hands and feet are affected first, but many people with rheumatoid arthritis are severely affected in their shoulders. There is no cure for RA at present, so treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness, and improve the ability to move. 
One common shoulder surgical treatment for people with RA is arthroplasty, i.e. the joint surface (and bone) is replaced with prosthesis (an artifical joint). 
 
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who have the type of shoulder surgery called “augmented subscapularis transposition”: 
 
Function  People with Augmented subscapularis transposition rated their physical function to be 4 points better on a scale of 0‐20 after 2 years compared to people who had augmented subscapularis alone.  (8% absolute improvement)
