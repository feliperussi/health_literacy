Animal‐source foods for growth and development in children 6 to 59 months of age
What is the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of animal‐source foods on the growth and development of children between 6 and 59 months of age. 
What is the rationale for studying this? 
The nutrition a child receives during the first five years of life is important for his or her growth and development. Animal‐source foods such as meat, fish, eggs, or dairy provide critical nutrients. Compared to foods such as iron‐fortified cereal products, the nutrients in animal‐source foods may be better absorbed by, and used in, the body. 
What studies were included? 
We included 6 studies with a total of 3036 children aged between 5 months and 50 months of age at enrollment. The interventions were conducted in China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, USA, and Zambia, and lasted between 5 and 12 months. 
Three studies compared animal‐source foods to a fortified (iron‐fortified or iron and zinc‐fortified) or unfortified cereal product. Two studies compared animal‐source foods to no intervention. One study compared meat to dairy. The types of animal‐source foods provided included beef, pork, eggs, yogurt, cheese, and powdered whey protein. 
Three studies were funded in part by government entities and in part by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies; we rated these studies as at unclear risk of other bias. One study was supported by a nonprofit organization. Two studies did not report a funding source. 
What were the main results? 
Animal‐source foods versus cereal‐based foods or no intervention 
Five studies (2972 children) reported data on growth (measured as height‐for‐age or length‐for‐age) and weight gain (measured as weight‐for‐age). Three studies (592 children) reported increases in weight‐for‐age as well as height‐for‐age or length‐for‐age in the intervention group, compared to the control group. Of the two remaining studies, one study (1062 children) found both groups decreased in both weight‐for‐age and length‐for‐age, with no differences between the groups. In the other study (1318 children), both groups also decreased for these outcomes, but the decrease was smaller in the intervention group compared to the control group. 
Three studies (1612 children) reported data on disease. One study with yogurt (402 children) found that children who received yogurt were less likely to experience diarrhea and respiratory infection and recovered faster when they did. One study with eggs (148 children) showed an increase in the incidence of diarrhea in children fed eggs, but this may have been due to cultural associations between eggs and gastrointestional problems. There were no differences in fever, respiratory infections, or skin conditions between the groups. The third study (1062 children) found no differences between the intervention and control groups for any measures of disease.
