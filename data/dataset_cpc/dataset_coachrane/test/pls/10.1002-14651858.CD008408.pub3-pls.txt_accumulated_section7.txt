Sweet taste to ease injection needle pain in children aged one to 16 years
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2011: Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle‐related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years. We re‐ran the search in October 2014. 
Review question: Do sweet tasting solutions reduce pain during needles in children aged from one to 16 years, compared to no treatment, water, other non‐sweet solutions, or other interventions such as non‐nutritive sucking (babies) or sweet foods or chewing gum (children), topical anaesthetics, music, and distraction? 
Background: Small amounts of sweet tasting sugar solutions given orally to babies before and during painful needles significantly reduces distress. However it was not known if the same pain‐reducing effects of sweet solutions occurred in children older than one year of age. We therefore examined studies looking at pain‐reducing effects of sweet solutions such as sucrose or glucose for painful needle procedures in children aged one to 16 years. 
Search date: We searched the literature for published and unpublished studies up to October 2014. 
Study characteristics: We found six studies focused on young children aged one to four years; two of these studies were included in the original review and four were new studies. The two studies included in the original review used a low concentration of sucrose, just 12%, which is not considered sweet enough for the pain reducing effects. Three of the four new studies were small pilot studies, conducted to inform full trials, and only one study of sweet solutions in young children included large numbers of children. When we compared results of all six studies, only two showed that sugar water (sucrose) reduced pain during injections. However, the four studies that showed no effect all included small numbers of children, therefore they were not considered large enough to detect significant differences in pain. Further well conducted trials with large enough numbers of young children are needed to work out if sweet taste effectively reduces their pain and distress during needles. 
For older school‐aged children, there were two studies published by the same author, both of which were included in the original review. Neither study showed that sweet taste helped to reduce pain. As other studies show that strategies such as distraction and topical anaesthetics can effectively reduce needle pain in school‐aged children, further studies of sweet taste for pain management in school‐aged children are not warranted.
