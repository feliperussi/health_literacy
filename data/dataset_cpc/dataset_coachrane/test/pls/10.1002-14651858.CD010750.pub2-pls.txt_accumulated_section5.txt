Drug treatments for pain in children and young people with life‐limiting conditions
Pain is commonly experienced in children and young people with diseases that are not curable and which may shorten their lives. These may be cancers or other diseases. Sometimes the pain is under‐treated, particularly for those nearing the end of their lives. There are many different types of drugs that have been developed to treat pain. There are also drugs that were not developed primarily to treat pain but which have an action that may provide pain relief. However, clinical guidelines to support doctors in their choice of treatment for pain are limited. This is because there are few trials specifically in children and young people that have tested the benefits and safety of such drugs. 
In this review we sought to find out precisely what the evidence is on drug treatments for pain in children and young people with diseases that are not curable and that may shorten their lives. 
We searched five large databases of published research projects. We found nine relevant randomised controlled trials. Five were for children and young people with cerebral palsy and four for those with a degenerative bone disease called osteogenesis imperfecta. 
Overall, these trials did not find clear evidence of a benefit of the drugs tested in the treatment of pain. This was apart from the two on cerebral palsy where pain relief occurred with the use of baclofen delivered via a catheter into the spinal cord. However the procedure to deliver this medication resulted in most side effect reported in these trials; this was swelling at the site of the catheter, and in one study it reported that this occurred in around half of the children (8/17). Five children also leaked spinal fluid from the catheter resulting in headache and nausea and, for two children, a prolonged hospital stay.
