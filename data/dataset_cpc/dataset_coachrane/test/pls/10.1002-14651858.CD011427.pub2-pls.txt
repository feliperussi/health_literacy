Accuracy of prehospital stroke scales to identify people with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) 
Background 
Stroke is a life‐threatening medical condition in which brain tissue is damaged. This could be caused by a clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain or bleeding in the brain. If symptoms resolve within 24 hours without lasting consequences, the condition is called TIA (mini stroke). Effective treatment depends on early identification of stroke and any delays may result in brain damage or death. 
Emergency medical services are the first point of contact for people experiencing symptoms suggestive of stroke. Medical responders could identify people with stroke more accurately if they use checklists called stroke recognition scales. Such scales include symptoms and other readily‐available information. A positive result on the scale indicates high risk of stroke and the need of urgent specialist assessment. The scales do not differentiate between stroke and TIA; this is done in hospital by a neurologist or stroke physician. 
Our objective was to review the research evidence on how accurately stroke recognition scales can detect stroke or TIA when used by paramedics or other prehospital clinicians, who are the first point of contact for people suspected of stroke. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 30 January 2018. We included studies assessing the accuracy of stroke recognition scales when applied to adults suspected of stroke out of hospital. 
We included 23 studies evaluating the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared two or more scales in the same people. The results from five studies were combined to estimate the accuracy of ROSIER in the emergency room (ER) and five studies to estimate the accuracy of LAPSS when used by ambulance clinicians. 
Quality of the evidence 
Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality and we could not be sure that their results were valid. 
Key results of the accuracy of the evaluated prehospital stroke scales 
Studies differed considerably in terms of included participants and other characteristics. As a consequence, studies evaluating the same scale reported variable results. 
We combined five studies evaluating ROSIER in the ER and obtained average sensitivity of 88% (88 out of 100 people with stroke/TIA will test positive on ROSIER). We were unable to obtain an estimate of specificity (how many people without stroke/TIA will test negative). 
We also combined the results for LAPSS, but the included studies were of poor quality and the results may not be valid. The rest of the scales were evaluated in a smaller number of studies or the results were too variable to be combined statistically. 
A small number of studies compared two or more scales when applied to the same participants. Such studies are more likely to produce valid results as the scales are used in the same circumstances. They reported that in the ER, ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy, but ROSIER was evaluated in more studies. When used by ambulance staff, CPSS identified more people with stroke/TIA in all studies, but also more people without stroke/TIA tested positive. 
Conclusion 
Current evidence suggests that CPSS should be used by ambulance clinicians in the field. Further research is needed to estimate the proportion of wrong results and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice. In a group of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). Because of the small number of studies evaluating the tests in a specific setting, poor quality, substantial differences in study characteristics and variability in results, these findings should be treated with caution and need further verification in better‐designed studies.
