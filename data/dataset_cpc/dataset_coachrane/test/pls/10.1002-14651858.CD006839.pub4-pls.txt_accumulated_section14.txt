Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)?
Background 
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection. 
Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods:
• simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants); 
• medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants);
• anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants); 
• keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves).
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises.
