Use of platelet transfusions prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthetic in people with a low platelet count 
Review question 
We evaluated the evidence for whether people with a low platelet count (increases risk of bleeding) require a platelet transfusion prior to insertion of a lumbar puncture needle or epidural catheter, and if so what is the platelet count level at which a platelet transfusion is required. 
Background 
Platelets are found in the blood and are an essential part of a blood clot. A low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. People with a low platelet count often require a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthetic for administration of treatment or to aid in diagnosis. 
A lumbar puncture is usually performed by inserting a needle between the bones (vertebrae) of the spine in the lower back into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (the bundle of nerves that runs down the spine and connects the brain with the body). Lumbar punctures are performed either to obtain a sample of this fluid or to administer treatment into the fluid (chemotherapy or an anaesthetic). The lumbar puncture needle is removed immediately after any fluid samples have been taken or treatment administered. 
An epidural involves inserting a needle with a larger diameter than a lumbar puncture needle. The epidural needle passes through the same tissues as the lumbar puncture needle, but stops short of penetrating the fluid sac surrounding the spinal cord. Instead any treatment is injected into the space just outside the fluid sac (called the epidural space). A small tube (an epidural catheter) is often passed through the epidural needle and left in position so that additional local anaesthetic medicines can be given.
