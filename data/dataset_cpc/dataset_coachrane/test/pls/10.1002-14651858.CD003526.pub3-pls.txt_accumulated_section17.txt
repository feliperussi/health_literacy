Preoperative education for hip or knee replacement
Background ‐ what is preoperative education? 
Preoperative education refers to any educational intervention delivered before surgery that aims to improve people's knowledge, health behaviours and health outcomes. The content of preoperative education varies across settings, but frequently comprises discussion of presurgical procedures, the actual steps in the surgical procedure, postoperative care, potential stressful scenarios associated with surgery, potential surgical and non‐surgical complications, postoperative pain management and movements to avoid post‐surgery. Education is often provided by physiotherapists, nurses or members of multidisciplinary teams, including psychologists. The format of education ranges from one‐to‐one verbal communication, patient group sessions, or video or booklet with no verbal communication. 
Study characteristics 
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research on whether preoperative education improves outcomes (e.g. pain, function) compared with usual care in people receiving hip or knee replacement. After searching for all relevant studies to May 2013, we included nine new studies since the last review, giving a total of 18 studies (1463 participants); 13 trials included 1074 people (73% of the total) undergoing hip replacement, three involved people undergoing knee replacement and two included both people with hip and knee replacements. Most participants were women (59%) and the mean age of participants was within the range of 58 to 73 years 
Key results ‐ what happens to people who have preoperative education compared with people who have usual care for hip replacement 
Postoperative anxiety (lower scores mean less anxiety): 
People with hip replacement who had preoperative education had postoperative anxiety at six weeks that was 2.28 points lower (ranging from 5.68 points lower to 1.12 points higher) (4% absolute improvement, ranging from 10% improvement to 2% worsening). ‐ People who had usual care for hip replacement rated their postoperative anxiety score as 32.16 points on a scale of 20 to 80 points. 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain): 
People with hip replacement who had preoperative education had pain at up to three months that was 0.34 points lower (ranging from 0.94 points lower to 0.26 points higher) (3% absolute improvement, ranging from 9% improvement to 3% worsening). ‐ People who had usual care for hip replacement rated their pain score as 3.1 points on a scale of 0 to 10 points. 
Function (lower scores mean better function or less disability): 
People with hip replacement who had preoperative education had function at 3 to 24 months that was 4.84 points lower (ranging from 10.23 points lower to 0.66 points higher) (7% absolute improvement, ranging from 15% improvement to 1% worsening). ‐ People who had usual care for hip replacement rated their function score as 18.4 points on a scale of 0 to 68 points. 
Side effects: 
About 5 fewer people out of 100 had adverse events (such as infection or deep vein thrombosis) with preoperative education compared with usual care but this estimate is uncertain. ‐ 18 out of 100 people reported adverse events with preoperative education for hip replacement. ‐ 23 out of 100 people reported adverse events with usual care for hip replacement. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review shows that in people receiving hip or knee replacement who are provided with preoperative education: 
There is low‐quality evidence suggesting that preoperative education may not improve pain, function, health‐related quality of life and postoperative anxiety any more than usual care. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these estimates and is likely to change the estimates.
