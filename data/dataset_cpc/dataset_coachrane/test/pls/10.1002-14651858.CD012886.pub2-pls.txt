Work‐break schedules for preventing musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy workers 
The number of workers suffering from work‐related musculoskeletal disorders is estimated to account for 21% to 28% of all days of occupational sick leave in 2017/2018 in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. These numbers indicate that work‐related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem for society as well as for employers. Interventions may counteract this problem, for example, by making changes to the workplace or work organisation. Many interventions have been investigated, such as training in ergonomics principles (work designs to increase productivity and comfort at the workplace), information and counselling, workstation adjustment, work‐break schedule adjustment, and job rotation. The current review focused on the effect of different work‐break schedules on outcomes related to work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms, since a systematic overview on this particular intervention is currently lacking. Different work‐break schedules may lead to an interruption or a decrease of long periods of repetitive or monotonous workloads. They may also lead to interruption of longer periods in which workers have to adopt static or awkward body postures, factors recognised as risk factors for developing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders. 
Aim 
We wanted to find out whether different frequencies, durations and types of work breaks can prevent work‐related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among healthy workers. We considered workers as healthy when they were free of musculoskeletal complaints at study enrolment. 
Studies 
We selected several primary outcome measures, including newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, participant‐reported musculoskeletal symptoms including pain, discomfort and fatigue, and productivity and work performance. The latter measure is not directly relevant to the worker but rather to the employer when it comes to maintaining business output. We selected changes in workload as a secondary outcome measure, which may include force output changes, electromyographic (recording of the electrical activity of muscles using electrodes) manifestations of muscle fatigue, or subjective change in workload (NASA‐TLX). None of the included studies reported any newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders or workload changes. 
We searched the literature until 2 May 2019 to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cross‐over RCTs of work‐break interventions aimed at preventing work‐related musculoskeletal disorders at work. We analysed all relevant studies to answer the research question and found six studies involving 373 workers, the majority of whom were female (≥ 78%), with a follow‐up period of two to 10 weeks. 
Key results 
Effect of different work‐break frequencies 
Five of the six studies evaluated different work‐break frequencies. The implementation of additional work breaks (three studies) may not have an effect on musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue when compared to no additional work breaks or work breaks taken as needed. Additional work breaks (three studies) may have a positive effect on productivity and work performance when compared to a conventional work‐break schedule. Additional higher frequency work breaks have been compared with additional lower frequency work breaks in one study, which resulted in no differences in participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, nor in productivity and work performance. 
Effect of different work‐break durations 
None of the studies evaluated the effect of duration of work breaks.
Effect of different work‐break types 
Two of the six studies evaluated different work‐break types. Active work breaks (one study) may not reduce nor increase the incidence of participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, or productivity and work performance. Similarly, different active work breaks have been compared with one another (one study), i.e. relaxation and physical active work breaks, which revealed no differences in participant‐reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue, nor in productivity and work performance. 
Conclusions 
At present, we conclude that there is very low‐ to low‐quality evidence that different work‐break frequencies and types may not considerably reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. Although the results suggest that there may be a positive effect of different work‐break frequencies on productivity and work performance, there is a need for high‐quality studies with large enough sample sizes to assess the effectiveness of different work‐break interventions. Furthermore, work‐break interventions should be reconsidered, taking into account worker populations other than office workers and the possibility of combining work‐break interventions with other interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may possibly prevent musculoskeletal disorders.
