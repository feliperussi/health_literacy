The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants 
Review question: Does antithrombin reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants? 
Background: Antithrombin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors. Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). 
Results: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). 
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.
