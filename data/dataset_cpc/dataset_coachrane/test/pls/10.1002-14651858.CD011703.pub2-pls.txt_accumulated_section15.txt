Effects of policies regulating insurance for drugs
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if drug insurance schemes change people’s use of medicines, the amount of money they spend on medicines, their health, and their use of healthcare. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. They found 58 studies. Most of these studies were from the US assessing a single policy change (Medicare Part D) implemented in January 2006. 
Key messages 
The USA’s Medicare Part D offers free prescription medicines to elderly people. This system may increase the amount of medicines elderly people use, but they may spend less money on medicines. We do not know if this system changes people’s health or their use of healthcare services because the certainty of the evidence was very low.  
What is a drug insurance scheme? 
In a drug insurance scheme, governments or private organisations offer people the medicines they need at a low cost or free of charge. The medicines are usually paid for through government taxes, people’s employers, people paying for membership in insurance schemes, or a combination of these systems. 
Many countries have mixed systems of public and private drug insurance. Some drug insurance schemes cover everyone in a country or setting. Other schemes only cover certain groups. For instance, some schemes only cover people in work, while other schemes only cover the poor and the elderly. 
Successful drug insurance schemes can improve people’s health by giving them the medicines they need either free or at a price they can afford. Drug insurance schemes can also save money for governments and private organisations. For instance, people using the right medicines may need fewer healthcare services. Governments and organisations running these schemes can also negotiate better prices with drug companies. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review authors found 58 relevant studies. Most of these studies were from the USA and 54 of them assessed one type of drug insurance scheme: Medicare Part D. 
Medicare Part D is a drug insurance scheme for elderly people. In this scheme, elderly people who are already on Medicare have free access to their prescription medicines up to a certain sum every year (in 2018, this sum was USD 3750 per person). After this sum is reached, other systems are used. These studies showed the following. 
‐ Medicare Part D may increase the amount of medicines people use (low‐certainty evidence).
‐ Medicare Part D may decrease the amount of money people spend on medicines (low‐certainty evidence). 
‐ Medicare Part D may lead to a small increase in the number of emergency department visits by beneficiaries of the scheme (low‐certainty evidence). 
‐ We do not know what the effect of Medicare Part D is on people’s health or on the use of other healthcare services because the certainty of the evidence was very low.
