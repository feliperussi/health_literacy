Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee disease
Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery.
