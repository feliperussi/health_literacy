Medical treatment for early fetal death (less than 24 weeks)
What is the issue? 
A miscarriage is the spontaneous death and/or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus before it is able to survive on its own. This natural death of an embryo or fetus ('non‐viable pregnancy' or 'intrauterine fetal death', depending on the duration of pregnancy) can be identified by ultrasound before symptoms like blood loss and abdominal pain occur. Sometimes an embryo may not have even developed ('empty sac'). In the past, treatment for a deceived embryo/fetus, has usually been by dilatation and curettage (D&C) surgery, but drugs have now been developed to replace the need for surgery which may be helpful for the expulsion to happen. Misoprostol and gemeprost are synthetic prostaglandin E analogues that can stimulate expulsion of the embryo/fetus from the uterus. Mifepristone blocks the activity of progesterone, a hormone that supports pregnancy. These and similar drugs may be useful in bringing on expulsion in women with a non‐viable pregnancy and can be used before 24 weeks' gestation. 
Waiting for spontaneous expulsion is also possible. Women who retain the dead embryo/fetus can experience severe blood loss or develop an infection of the womb. These are rare complications. Gastro‐intestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, cramping or abdominal pain and fever have been reported with misoprostol. 
Why is this important? 
Surgical treatment has the disadvantage of requiring anaesthesia. It carries risks of damage to the uterus or cervix and possible development of fibrous tissue in the inner lining of the uterus. These can be avoided if the non‐viable pregnancy is treated with medication, or if the woman is able to wait for a spontaneous expulsion. 
We set out to determine if medical treatment is as good as, or better than, surgical treatment or expectant management (waiting for the expulsion to happen). Furthermore, we compared different doses and administration routes in order to detect which regimen most often induces a complete miscarriage with the fewest side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
For this updated review, 43 randomised clinical trials involving 4966 women with non‐viable pregnancies at less than 24 weeks' gestation were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. Fourteen comparisons had only one trial. The studies varied in risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low or low for most comparisons. 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo but made little difference to rates of nausea, diarrhoea or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method. It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol when compared to placebo reduces blood loss or pain because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol was less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management and may be associated with more nausea and diarrhoea. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to pelvic infection, blood loss, pain or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method when compared to surgical management.
