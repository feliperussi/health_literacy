Grid laser photocoagulation for macular oedema after branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) 
Review question: We assessed the role of macular grid laser (laser performed in a grid pattern) compared to other new treatments. 
Background  When a vein is blocked ('occluded') in the retina at the back of the eye, swelling of the macula (the central retina) can occur, which reduces vision. The options are to wait to see whether the swelling clears up on its own, or to treat the swelling by applying laser to the macula, injecting the eye with steroids or injecting the eye with anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF). Laser has been an established mode of treatment ever since a landmark study, (the Branch Vein Occlusion Study in 1984) showed the advantage of laser compared to no treatment. However, over the last 10 years laser technology has evolved, and new injection treatments have become available.

Study characteristics  We include five studies with a total of 715 participants. Three studies were from Italy and two were from the USA. 
Key results  We looked primarily at the proportion of participants gaining or losing significant vision. The trial comparing grid laser to no laser showed a clear benefit for grid laser. The result of the trial comparing early grid laser to delayed grid laser for macular BRVO (a subgroup of BRVO in which the occlusion is limited to a small vessel draining a sector of the macular region) was uncertain, and the quality of the evidence was low. We could not be certain that bevacizumab injections were better than grid laser treatment, because the effect was imprecise and the quality of the evidence was low. We could not be certain if subthreshold diode laser treatment was better than threshold laser treatment because the results were imprecise. The trial comparing grid laser treatment to triamcinolone (steroid) injection was imprecise, but there was a suggestion of a benefit for grid laser over 1 mg triamcinolone at 36 months and a benefit for grid laser over 4 mg triamcinolone at 24 months. Two of the five studies were at risk of bias, meaning that there were problems with the design and execution of two of the five studies which raised questions about the validity of these two studies.
