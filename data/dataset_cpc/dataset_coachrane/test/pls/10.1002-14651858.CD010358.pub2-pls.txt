Dexmedetomidine for prevention of acute pain after abdominal surgery in adults
Background and review question 
Acute pain after surgery is a problem for patients undergoing abdominal surgery. In addition to postoperative pain, the side effects of treatment with pain killers, in particular those of opioids (drugs resembling morphine), need to be reduced. Dexmedetomidine is an opioid sparing drug (reduces the need for opioids). We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine in reducing the need for opioids and in preventing acute pain after abdominal surgery in adults. We wanted to discover how safe dexmedetomidine was and whether it was effective in preventing some of the known side effects of opioids, such as nausea and vomiting, reduced bowel function and delayed mobilization (getting up and moving around) after abdominal surgery. 
Study characteristics 
Evidence is current to May 2014. We included seven studies with 492 participants from five different countries and included 422 participants in our analysis. Most participants were middle‐aged. Participants had almost no diseases other than their reason for having surgery. The type of surgery was planned abdominal surgery. Three of the seven studies looked only at obesity surgery. Participants received dexmedetomidine right before or during their abdominal surgery. Six studies compared dexmedetomidine with no treatment, and one small study compared dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (a strong opioid). 
We reran the search in May 2015 and found nine studies of interest, which we will discuss when we update the review. In total, 13 studies are awaiting classification. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Most of the studies that compared dexmedetomidine with no treatment found that dexmedetomidine reduced the need for opioids for treating pain for 24 hours after surgery. During the same period, no important differences in pain were noted, except one study (80 participants) showed a reduction in intensity of pain at two hours after surgery with dexmedetomidine. The quality of the evidence was very low because the results were not similar across studies, and because some studies were poorly conducted. The influence of dexmedetomidine on postoperative nausea and vomiting could not be determined because results were not similar across studies. No conclusion could be made for bowel function and mobilization and side effects such as postoperative sedation, as data were insufficient. One study with 80 participants reported a higher rate of low blood pressure ('low' meaning that medication was required) for participants receiving a high dose of dexmedetomidine compared with no treatment, but for lower doses of dexmedetomidine, they noted no differences compared with no treatment. 
For the comparison dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl, data were insufficient to allow conclusions (only one small study). 
Conclusion 
Dexmedetomidine ‐ compared with no treatment ‐ seemed to reduce the need for opioids without worsening the experience of postoperative pain after abdominal surgery in adults. However, the quality of evidence was very low because studies were poorly conducted and because results were not similar across studies. The importance of these findings for patients was also uncertain because the influence of dexmedetomidine on bowel function, mobilization and adverse effects could not be properly determined.The seven included studies were small, so side effects associated with use of dexmedetomidine may be greater than this review reported. In addition, we could not obtain relevant data from several studies because investigators mixed abdominal surgery with other types of surgery.
