Epidural local anaesthetics for prevention of postoperative gastrointestinal paralysis, vomiting and pain after abdominal surgery 
Background 
Pain and gut paralysis (movement failure) commonly occur after abdominal surgery. Following laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy, approximately 10.3% of patients will have temporary gut paralysis. This may prolong length of hospital stay and may increase costs of the procedure. Among the possible ways to treat pain after abdominal surgery are an epidural and injections of opioids (morphine‐like substances or pain killers). An epidural consists of inserting a catheter (a narrow tube) into the epidural space (the virtual space surrounding the membrane that contains cerebrospinal fluid and the spinal cord) and infusing a solution of local anaesthetic (substance that cuts pain transmission to the brain) (alone or in combination with opioids) to anaesthetize the abdomen. This Cochrane review compares the effects of an epidural containing a local anaesthetic with those of an opioid‐based regimen on the postoperative course after abdominal surgery. 
Search dates 
The evidence is current to December 2014. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the next review update. 
Study characteristics 
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants of both sexes aged between 33 and 76 years in the review and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Three trials reported that their trial was officially registered. 
Study funding sources  
Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other trials. 
Key results 
We found that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic reduces the time required for return of gut function compared with an opioid‐based regimen (equivalent to 17 hours). An epidural providing a local anaesthetic and an opioid also reduce pain (equivalent to a reduction of 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery) and time spent in hospital for open surgery (equivalent to one day). We found no evidence that an epidural with a local anaesthetic would affect the incidence of vomiting or poor healing of the gut. 
Quality of evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as high for return of gastrointestinal function, moderate for pain treatment, low for no effect on vomiting or healing of the gut and very low for reduced time spent in the hospital after open surgery.
