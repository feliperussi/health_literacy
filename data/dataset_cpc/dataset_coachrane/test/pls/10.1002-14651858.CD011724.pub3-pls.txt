The aspiration of pneumothorax in the newborn with a small needle compared to a larger tube placed through the intercostal space 
Review question: Does the use of a needle to aspirate pneumothorax compared to an intercostal tube (a tube inserted between ribs) reduce mortality in newborns? 
Background: Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space (the space between the lung and the chest wall). It is a serious condition in the newborn and may be treated by needle aspiration or chest tube placement. The former is less invasive and might avoid the need for the insertion of a chest tube, thus reducing the duration of hospital stay. However the failure of needle aspiration might subsequently lead to the need for chest tube insertion, an additional invasive procedure. This systematic review evaluates the available evidence on the effectiveness of these two techniques in treating pneumothorax in neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included one study (enrolling 70 newborn infants) that compared needle aspiration followed by immediate removal to chest tube placement for the treatment of pneumothorax and one study (72 newborn infants) that compared needle aspiration with the angiocatheter left in situ to chest tube placement for the treatment of pneumothorax. Evidence is up to date as of June 2018. 
Key results: The use of needle aspiration compared to chest tube placement did not reduce mortality or any complications related to the procedure. About 30% of the infants with pneumothorax who were treated with needle aspiration followed by immediate removal never required the placement of an intercostal tube; none of the infants with pneumothorax who were treated with needle aspiration left in situ required the placement of an intercostal tube. However multiple factors might explain this finding. 
Quality of evidence: The two small trials identified do not provide sufficient information to determine which of the two techniques is better to treat pneumothorax in neonates. However it seems that needle aspiration might reduce the need for an intercostal tube in a relevant proportion of newborn infants.
