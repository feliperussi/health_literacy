Treatment methods for people with necrotising pancreatitis (pancreatic destruction due to inflammation of pancreas) 
Review question 
How should people with necrotising pancreatitis be treated?
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen (tummy) that secretes several digestive enzymes (substances that enable and speed up chemical reactions in the body) into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also contains the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones including insulin (helps regulate blood sugar). Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation of the pancreas and can lead to destruction of the pancreas (pancreatic necrosis). Pancreatic necrosis can be infected or non‐infected (sterile). Pancreatic necrosis can lead to failure of other organs, such as the lungs and kidneys, and is a life‐threatening illness. The main treatments for pancreatic necrosis include removal of the dead tissue (debridement or necrosectomy), peritoneal lavage (washing dead tissue out of the abdomen, drainage (inserting a tube or 'drain' to drain out the fluid collection around the pancreas), or initial drainage followed by necrosectomy if necessary (called the minimally invasive 'step‐up' approach). The minimally invasive step‐up approach can be performed in different ways. For example, in video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach, necrosectomy is performed after a period of drainage through a key‐hole operation; in the endoscopic minimally invasive step‐up approach, necrosectomy is performed with the help of an endoscope (instrument used to look inside the abdomen). 
The best way to treat people with necrotising pancreatitis is not clear. We sought to resolve this issue by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) whose results were reported to 7 April 2015.
