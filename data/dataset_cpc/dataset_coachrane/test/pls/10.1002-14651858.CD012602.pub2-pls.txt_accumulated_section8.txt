Which management option is best when women experience an early miscarriage?
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of pregnancy loss and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% of pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Miscarriage can lead to serious complications, including haemorrhage and infection, and even death, particularly in low‐income countries. Miscarriage is generally defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation. Most miscarriages happen in the first 14 weeks, and are known as early miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Miscarriage can be managed expectantly (waiting for the pregnancy tissue to pass naturally), medically (tablets given to make the womb expel the pregnancy tissue) or surgically (removal of the pregnancy tissue during surgery). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side effects of the available methods for managing a miscarriage. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out which method is the most effective and safest with the least side effects. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in February 2021 and identified 78 studies involving 17,795 women. Most women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with missed (also called silent miscarriage where no pregnancy tissue has been expelled and there is no bleeding or pain) or incomplete miscarriage (already started to bleed or have pain and perhaps expelled some pregnancy tissue). We found evidence for six different methods of managing a miscarriage; three surgical methods (suction aspiration plus cervical preparation, dilatation and curettage, or suction aspiration), two medical methods (mifepristone plus misoprostol or misoprostol alone), and expectant management or placebo. 
The analysis suggested that all three surgical methods and both medical methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for completing the process of miscarriage. Suction aspiration plus cervical preparation was the best method of miscarriage management followed by dilatation and curettage, and suction aspiration alone. The two medical methods of mifepristone combined with misoprostol, and misoprostol alone were ranked fourth and fifth best methods, respectively.
