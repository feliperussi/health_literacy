Treatments for broken ankles in children
Background 
A broken ankle, also called an ankle fracture, involves a break in one or more of the three bones that make up the ankle. It often results from a twisted ankle. Ankle fracture is a common injury in children. Some fractures are minor, and the bones remain in place. Other fractures are more serious, such as when the broken bones are displaced from each other or even come through the skin. These fractures can affect the way the bones grow. Serious disruption of the growth plates may result in leg deformity. 
Minor fractures are often treated by placing the injured leg in a removable fibreglass splint or a plaster cast. These devices may also be used for some displaced fractures after the displaced fracture parts have been put back into place. However, displaced fractures often require surgery. An operation enables the surgeon to put the broken bone pieces back into their correct places. Screws, plates and pins are typically used to hold the bones in place. The leg is usually placed in a plaster cast while the bones heal. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to September 2015 and included three randomised studies reporting results for 189 children. All the children were considered by the treating clinicians to have minor ankle fractures that were at low risk of growth‐plate complications. 
Key results 
Two studies compared the use of a removable prefabricated ankle brace with a rigid cast. One study used a removable fibreglass splint for two weeks, and the other used a below‐the‐knee plaster walking cast for three weeks. Both studies provided some evidence of a quicker recovery of self reported function at four weeks in children who were treated with an ankle brace compared with those treated with a rigid cast. One study reported more complications, such as pressure marks and blisters, in the brace group. Most of these were attributed to a protective sock not being worn with the brace. The other study reported more unscheduled visits to healthcare providers for problems in the rigid‐cast group. In this study, children much preferred the brace, which could be removed after five days, than the cast, which remained on for three weeks. Neither study reported results in the long term.
