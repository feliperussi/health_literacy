Corticosteroids for preventing serious breathing problems in the newborn after caesarean section at term 
What is the issue? 
Babies born at term (at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy) by planned (elective) caesarean section, before onset of labour, are more likely to develop breathing complications than babies born vaginally. Giving injections called corticosteroids to the mother has been shown to reduce the risk of breathing problems in babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy, but it is not clear if they are also useful for babies born by caesarean section at term. 
Why is this important? 
Caesarean section increases the risk of a term newborn developing breathing problems, such as rapid breathing over the first few days (known as transient tachypnoea of the neonate) and the more serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The affected babies may need treatment in special care units. This risk decreases from 37 weeks to 39 weeks of gestation, at which stage it is low. Most caesarean sections are performed after 39 weeks of gestation, but there are some instances when babies need to be born earlier. The aim of this review was to investigate if corticosteroids can reduce the rates of breathing problems prior to caesarean section, without causing problems for the mother or the infant. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies that met our criteria for being trustworthy and compared the effects of corticosteroids against a placebo (dummy) treatment or against usual care. We rated our confidence in the findings based on factors such as the number of studies, study methods, number of women and babies involved, the number of events and the variability of the findings. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included evidence up until 20 January 2021. We included one trial that involved 942 women and 942 babies recruited from 10 UK hospitals. The women in the treatment group received two doses of the corticosteroid betamethasone by injection into the muscle. The women in the control group received usual care. No blinding procedures were used therefore all the women, caregivers and investigators were aware of who received corticosteroids and who received usual care. 
It is uncertain if corticosteroids reduce the risk of transient tachypnoea of the neonate (a mild breathing problem) or respiratory distress syndrome (i.e serious breathing problems) compared with usual care. Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of admission to neonatal special care for breathing complications compared with usual care. 
It is uncertain if corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of the baby needing additional breathing support (mechanical ventilation) compared with usual care. It is uncertain if antenatal corticosteroids have any effect on women developing infection or high temperature within 72 hours of giving birth (there were no cases in the one study involving 942 women).
