High versus standard volume feeds to promote growth in preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review question Does giving preterm (born at < 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants a greater volume of feeds than is usually given, promote growth without causing feeding problems or other side effects? 
BackgroundInfants born early (preterm) need extra nutrients for growth. One way to deliver extra nutrition is to give infants a greater volume of feeds than usual (high volume feeds, equal to or greater than 180 to 200 mL/kg/day of milk). Although giving high volumes of milk to preterm or low birth weight infants might increase growth rates, there are concerns that infants may not tolerate high volume feeds and may experience side effects including severe bowel problems. We have looked for evidence from clinical trials that assessed whether high volume feeds are beneficial or harmful for preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Study characteristicsSearch is up‐to‐date as of June 2020. We found three studies that addressed this question. 
Key resultsEvidence from two studies showed that high volume feeds (≥ 180 mL/kg/day) with fortified human milk (human milk with added human milk fortifier) or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay, when compared to standard volume of the same. Similarly, evidence from one small study showed that high volume feeds (≥ 200 mL/kg/day) with unfortified human milk or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay. The evidence is insufficient to comment on the effect of high volume feeds on increase in length or head size during hospital stay, long‐term growth and development, and the effect on gut problems or other side effects. 
Conclusions 
High volume feeds probably improve weight gain during hospital stay. The available data is inadequate to draw conclusions on the effect of high volume feeds on other growth and clinical outcomes.
