Treatment of below‐the‐knee deep vein thrombosis
Background 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein, most commonly in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. This is known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. The blood clot can dislodge and travel in the blood, particularly to the pulmonary arteries. This is known as pulmonary embolism, or PE. The term VTE includes both DVT and PE. 
Distal DVT (also known as isolated distal DVT, calf DVT or below‐the‐knee DVT) occurs when the blood clot develops inside the leg veins (below the knee). The extension of the clot in proximal (above the knee) veins and the migration of a clot to the lungs (PE) are the most common complications. The best treatment of distal DVT is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation (medicines that help prevent blood clots), with or without additional use of compression stockings, or no medications can be given, and monitoring with repeat ultrasounds can be performed to see if the clots grow, which requires anticoagulation. The main side effect of anticoagulation medication is the increased risk of bleeding. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We identified eight randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) reporting on 1239 participants. Five of these trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months compared with no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. 
Our review demonstrated that in participants with distal DVT compared with no anticoagulation or placebo (pretend treatment), anticoagulation reduced the risk of recurrence of VTE. There were similar results for the recurrence of DVT, while there was no clear effect on risk of PE. This benefit was seen at the expense of an increase in clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, but not major bleeding. 
In a direct comparison of treatment duration, anticoagulation for three months or more was superior to a shorter course lasting up to six weeks, showing a reduced risk of recurrence of VTE and DVT with no clear difference in major bleeding and clinically relevant non‐major bleeding. 
Reliability of the evidence 
For the comparison anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation or placebo, the reliability of the evidence was high for recurrence of VTE, DVT, and clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, and low for PE and major bleeding. For the comparison anticoagulation for three months or more versus six weeks, the reliability of the evidence was high for recurrence of VTE and DVT; and low for PE, major bleeding and clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, The reliability of the evidence was downgraded because of variation (or imprecision) of the results due to small numbers of events.
