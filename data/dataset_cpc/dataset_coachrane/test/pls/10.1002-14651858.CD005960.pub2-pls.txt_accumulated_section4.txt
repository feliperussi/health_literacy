Patellar or hamstring tendon grafts for ACL reconstruction in adults
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is important for maintaining the stability in the knee, particularly in activities involving cutting, pivoting or kicking. People with ruptured ACLs have unstable knees that generally become more damaged over time. Reconstruction of ruptured ACLs commonly involves using autografts (grafts taken from the person undergoing surgery), obtained by removing part of the patellar tendon or the hamstring tendon. This review aimed to find out if one graft was better than the other. 
This review included 19 studies reporting the outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon grafts in a total of 1597 young to middle‐aged adults. Many trials used flawed methods that might have affected their results. 
The limited data available for functional outcomes including patient‐rated assessment did not show whether one graft was better than the other. Similarly, there were no differences found between the two types of graft for re‐rupture or in the results of an internationally used knee score. All tests for knee stability favoured patellar tendon grafts. Conversely, people had more anterior knee pain and discomfort with kneeling after patellar tendon reconstruction. After patellar tendon reconstruction, more people had some loss in their ability to straighten out their leg at the knee. In contrast, more people had some loss in their ability to bend their leg at the knee after hamstring tendon reconstruction. It is not clear how important these losses in range of motion of the knee were to the patients themselves.
