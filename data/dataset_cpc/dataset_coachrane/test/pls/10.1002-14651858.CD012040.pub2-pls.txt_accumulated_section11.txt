Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
What are the effects of ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon (class I) mutations) on clinical outcomes (quality of life, lung function and adverse effects) in people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis, the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is faulty. In particular, this affects the airways, which become dehydrated making it difficult to clear thick mucus, which in turn leads to progressive lung infection and damage and a reduction in life expectancy. Ataluren and similar compounds can mask the abnormal gene sequence and may be able to restore production of the faulty protein in people with certain cystic fibrosis mutations (premature termination codon (class I) mutations). These treatments aim to help the airways retain more water allowing them to clear the mucus better, so that these people develop fewer lung infections.

Study characteristics 
We found one trial (238 people took part) comparing ataluren to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication). The trial lasted 48 weeks and included both males and females aged six years and older. Everyone taking part had at least one copy of a nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation that causes cystic fibrosis). 
Key Results 
In those people who took ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight. The trial found that kidney damage was more common in people who took ataluren. The trial investigators then analysed the results in a way that they hadn't planned originally and looked at how ataluren or placebo affected people depending on whether they were using inhaled tobramycin on a long‚Äêterm basis or not. They found that amongst those not taking inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations in the ataluren group compared to the placebo group.
