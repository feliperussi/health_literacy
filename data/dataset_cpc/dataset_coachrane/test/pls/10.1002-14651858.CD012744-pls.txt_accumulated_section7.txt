Drugs for preventing dry mouth and problems with saliva after radiotherapy
Review question 
To assess the effects of treatment with drugs in order to prevent damage to salivary glands following radiotherapy to the head and neck 
Background 
Problems with saliva production and salivary glands are a significant and mostly permanent side effect for people after radiotherapy treatment to the head and neck. When this occurs the condition is known as dry mouth or xerostomia. Dry mouth is not measurable and is a subjective or personal expression of how the mouth feels. It can have other causes and is a consequence of the production of less saliva or by the consistency of saliva. The rate of flow of saliva in an individual's mouth however can be measured. People who have dry mouth have a reduced quality of life. They can experience issues with taste and general discomfort, difficulties chewing, swallowing and speaking as well as tooth decay, thrush and other infections of the mouth. A wide range of drugs that work in different ways have been used to try and prevent problems with salivary glands caused by radiotherapy. Unfortunately there is currently not enough evidence to show which drugs or which type of drugs are most effective. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review is current up to 14 September 2016. 39 studies were included with a total of 3520 participants. Participants were male and female, all ages and ethnic origins, out patients or in patients, who were scheduled to have radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to the head and neck.
