Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs versus corticosteroids for controlling inflammation after uncomplicated cataract surgery 
Review aim  The aim of this review was to find out if topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (alone or taken in combination with topical corticosteroids) or topical corticosteroids alone are better for controlling eye inflammation after cataract surgery. Cochrane review authors collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 48 studies. 
Key messages  It is unclear whether NSAIDs or corticosteroids are better at treating eye inflammation after cataract surgery. There were many combinations of drugs and dosing regimens in the included studies. The majority of the studies did not provide data on inflammation. 
What was studied in this review?  Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed eye surgeries. Eye inflammation is common after cataract surgery. If left untreated, this inflammation can cause many complications. NSAIDs or corticosteroids are typically used to control swelling after cataract surgery. These drugs work differently, so comparing their effects is necessary. Cochrane review authors compared the effectiveness of NSAIDs (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) versus corticosteroids alone for controlling swelling after cataract surgery. 
Main results  We included 48 randomized controlled trials from 17 different countries. Fifteen studies compared an NSAID with a corticosteroid. Nineteen studies compared an NSAID plus corticosteroid versus a corticosteroid alone. Fourteen other studies had more than two study arms, with different combinations of NSAIDs and corticosteroids. 
In comparing participants who received an NSAID with those who received a corticosteroid: 
• it was unclear whether the number of cells, which were a sign of inflammation inside the eye, was higher or lower
