Brief family intervention for schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a persons thoughts, perceptions and emotions. Research has found that the chance of someone with mental illness having a relapse is greater when their family is over‐involved, hostile, critical and dissatisfied ‐ a concept known as 'expressed emotions'. Family interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia and are now widely used. They are designed to promote positive family environments and reduce levels of expressed emotions within families as well as providing insight into the signs and symptoms of mental illness, so family members can anticipate and help stop relapse. There have been various psychosocial programmes designed over the years, including: counselling groups for family members; family therapy; educational groups for relatives; group therapy for family members; and educational lectures for family members. These are delivered by skilled, trained mental health professionals, who work with the families every two weeks or so, sometimes across considerable time periods, such as one year. 
Brief family intervention is a form of family intervention where a mental health professional educates the person with schizophrenia and their family members about the illness over a limited number of sessions. 
This review investigates the effects of brief family intervention for people with schizophrenia, compared to standard or usual care. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trial register was carried out in July 2012. Four randomised studies, with a total of 163 participants were included. Results were limited, so it is not clear if brief family intervention reduces admission to hospital, decreases people using health services and reduces relapse for people with schizophrenia. The review found some evidence that brief family intervention might increase the understanding of family members about mental illness. However, all main findings are not strong and based on low or very low quality evidence. Despite this, the authors of the review suggest that brief family intervention should not be completely dismissed, as it is in a current state of demand and there are usually resources or local services available for people with mental health problems and their families to participate in as a part of recovery. The authors also suggest that brief family intervention could be improved to be more effective but this would depend on larger and better studies of brief family intervention being carried out, which would help guide good practice and lead to better outcomes for people with schizophrenia.
