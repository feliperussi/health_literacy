Three trials including 168 trainees reported the complications that the patients developed during or immediately after the operation. There were no deaths in either group in 168 operations performed by 168 trainees and we could not tell whether laparoscopic box model training led to major complications (one major complication in one patient operated by a trainee who underwent standard training out of 86 operations performed by trainees who underwent standard training as compared with no major complications in 82 operations performed by trainees who underwent box model training). None of the trials reported patient quality of life. One trial reported a small reduction in operating time of just over six minutes in the supplementary box model training group. The remaining trials did not report operating time. In one trial, the proportion of patients who were discharged as day‚Äêsurgery was significantly higher in the supplementary box model training group (24/24 (100%)) compared with the standard training group (15/26 (57.7%)). The remaining trials did not report the proportion of people who stayed overnight. None of the trials reported trainee satisfaction. The operating performance as assessed by surgical experts was significantly better in the supplementary box model training group compared with the standard training group. None of the trials compared box model training compared with animal model training or compared with different methods of box model training. Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with standard surgical training in trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience. It may also decrease operating time and decrease the proportion of patients who require overnight stay in the first hernia repair operation that the trainee performed after box model training. However, the duration of the benefit of box model training (ie, whether such benefit continues in subsequent operations) is unknown.
