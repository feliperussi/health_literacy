Do injectable pneumococcal vaccines prevent pneumonia in people with COPD?
We wanted to find out if pneumococcal vaccination for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduces the risk of pneumonia and associated mortality. We found a total of 12 studies including 2171 participants. Evidence gathered in this review is current to December 2015. 
Background 
People with COPD are at increased risk of respiratory illness such as pneumonia due to a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, other community‐acquired pneumonias and acute COPD exacerbations. These illnesses increase mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. 
Study characteristics 
For this updated review, we identified five new studies (606 participants), bringing the total number of studies to 12, involving 2171 participants with COPD. The average age of participants was 66 years, 67% were male and participants had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. Eleven studies compared an injectable vaccine versus a control, and one study compared two different types of injectable vaccine. 
Key results 
People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience an episode of community‐acquired pneumonia; 19 people with COPD (95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 52) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Vaccination made no difference in the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia due to S pneumoniae or in the chance of dying or of being admitted to hospital. People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience a COPD exacerbation; eight people with COPD (95% CI 5 to 58) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one person from having an acute exacerbation. We found no difference in effectiveness between the two types of injectable vaccine.
