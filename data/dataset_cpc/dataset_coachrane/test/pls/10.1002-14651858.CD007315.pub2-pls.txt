Perioperative glycaemic control for diabetic patients undergoing surgery
Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of complications after surgery compared with the general population. Diabetes is a well‐known risk factor for complications after surgery, causing longer hospital stay, higher health care resource utilisation and more deaths. One of the most important medical complications is the increased risk of infection in the period around a surgical procedure. However, it is still not clear whether targeting more intensive blood glucose control (glycaemic control) is better than targeting conventional blood glucose control for the reduction of surgical risk in people with diabetes mellitus. 
We identified 12 randomised controlled clinical trials investigating perioperative control of blood sugar levels. The perioperative period is the time period surrounding a patient's surgical procedure, involving ward admission, anaesthesia, surgery and recovery, and includes the preoperative (before operation), intraoperative (during operation) and postoperative (after operation) phases of surgery. We included a total of 694 diabetic participants randomised to perioperative intensive glucose control and 709 diabetic participants randomised to conventional or regular glucose control in our analyses. The trials were conducted in all continents except for Africa. The mean duration of the intervention period varied from a few hours to 90 days. The mean age of the participants was 64 years. 
Despite attaining lower blood glucose concentrations during the perioperative period, intensive blood glucose control did not significantly reduce the risk of relevant postoperative outcomes such as infectious complications, death from any cause, cardiovascular complications, renal failure and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Due to posthoc evaluation of data, there is some evidence that targeting intensive glucose control increases the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes, but confirmation is needed from additional studies. One study assessed health‐related quality of life in 12/37 (32%) participants in the intensive glucose intervention group and 13/44 (30%) participants in the regular glucose control group, and did not show an important difference. None of the studies investigated the cost‐effects of the interventions. Based on the results of our review, the best approach for how to handle blood glucose control during surgery in patients with diabetes mellitus is not clear. We suggest that insulin treatment regimens, patient‐ and health‐system relevant outcomes, and time points for outcome measures should be defined in a thorough and uniform way in future studies.
