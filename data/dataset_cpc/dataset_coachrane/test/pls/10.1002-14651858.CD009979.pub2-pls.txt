What is the best nursing handover style to ensure continuity of information for hospital patients? 
What is a nursing handover? 
A nursing handover occurs when one nurse hands over the responsibility of care for a patient to another nurse, for example, at the end of a nursing shift. On average, nursing handovers occur three times a day for each patient. 
What styles of nursing handover exist? 
In daily practice handovers are done in various ways, some handovers are done through nurses talking to each other (verbal handovers). Others are done through nurses reading the patient’s medical notes or through a combination of reading and talking to each other. In some cases they are done at the patient’s bedside, so that the patient can contribute, if desired. 
Why does the style of nursing handovers need to be investigated? 
When a nurse hands over responsibility of care to another nurse there is an opportunity for error if all the important medical information is not shared thoroughly and efficiently. Failing to mention ‐ or grasp ‐ information may result in delays in treatment or diagnosis for the patient, inappropriate treatment, or failure to provide appropriate care. Consequently, an accurate handover of clinical information is essential to ensure continuity of care and patients’ safety. 
The purpose and findings of this review 
This review tried to find out which nursing handover style works best.
In March 2013 the review authors conducted a wide search for suitable relevant studies (randomised controlled studies) that compared different styles of nursing handover. However, they were not able to identify any randomised controlled studies that investigated the question, and so could draw no conclusions. Further research in this area is urgently needed.
