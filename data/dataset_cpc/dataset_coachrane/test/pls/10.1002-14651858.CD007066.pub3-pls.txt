Blood pressure lowering efficacy of aliskiren
Review Question(s): 
We wanted to determine if aliskiren was better than placebo for reducing blood pressure in adult patients with raised blood pressure, and whether this drug had increased adverse effects. We also wanted to determine if there was a change in blood pressure variability, pulse pressure, heart rate and withdrawal due to side effects. 
We searched the available medical literature to find all the trials that had assessed these questions. The data included in this review is up to date as of February 2017. 
Background 
High blood pressure or hypertension can lead to heart attacks and stroke. A new class of drugs called renin inhibitors is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is the only drug of the renin inhibitor class that has been studied and approved for treatment of hypertension at this time. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies, eight weeks in duration, that randomly assigned 7439 adult people with uncomplicated mild‐to‐moderate hypertension to aliskiren at doses ranging from 75 mg to 600 mg or placebo. All studies were funded by the manufacturer Novartis. Detailed information regarding adverse events, obtained from nine clinical study reports submitted to regulators, are included in this update. 
Key Results 
We concluded that aliskiren is better than placebo at lowering blood pressure and that the magnitude of this effect could be similar to other classes of drugs when 300 mg, which is the maximum recommended dose, is used. Aliskiren 300 mg reduced blood pressure by eight points in the upper number (called systolic blood pressure) and five points in the lower number (called diastolic blood pressure). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure changeability. Due to very limited information regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure (difference between upper and lower number) it was not possible to analyze these outcomes. 
The studies were too short in duration to assess side effects. Aliskiren did not increase death, non‐fatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to side effects. The most common adverse events observed were headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg as compared to placebo. 
Quality of evidence: The decrease in blood pressure at the recommended dose was rated as moderate‐quality evidence and adverse event data was graded as low‐quality evidence as included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of reporting and funding bias.
