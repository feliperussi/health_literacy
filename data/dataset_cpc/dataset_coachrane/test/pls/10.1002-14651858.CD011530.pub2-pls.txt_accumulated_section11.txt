Antibiotics for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections in children at high risk aged 12 years and under 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for antibiotics to prevent bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children aged 12 years and under who are at increased chance of contracting such infections. 
Background 
Annually, about 1.4 million children die from respiratory tract infections. One in five of these deaths occur in children under five years old. Using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in high‚Äêrisk children aged 12 years and under may be beneficial. However, no review currently describes the evidence for using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in this population. 
Study characteristics 
In February 2015, we searched for studies examining the effect of antibiotics to prevent LRTI in children aged 12 years and under with an increased risk of contracting such infections. 
We included 10 studies; three examined the effectiveness of antibiotics in 1345 children with HIV, four in 429 children with cystic fibrosis, one in 219 children with sickle cell disease, one in 160 children undergoing treatment for cancer, and one in 40 children who were underweight at birth with underlying breathing problems. 
The study duration was between 18.9 and 24.7 months for children with HIV, between six and 36 months in children with cystic fibrosis, 15 months in one study of children with sickle cell disease, 13 to 24 months in one study of children with cancer, and seven days in low birth weight newborns with underlying respiratory problems. 
Study funding sources 
Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity.
