A review of techniques for tubal sterilisation (blocking the fallopian tubes)
Background 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2011. 
Tubal sterilisation prevents pregnancy by stopping the woman's unfertilised eggs from passing through the fallopian tubes to be fertilised by sperm. Techniques to close the tubes include cutting and tying them (partial salpingectomy), blocking them mechanically by using clips or rings, or by applying electric current (electrocoagulation) to damage and block them, and blocking them by using chemicals or tubal inserts (inserted via the mouth of the womb) that cause tubal scarring. 
Methods 
We, the Cochrane researchers, wanted to compare the different techniques for tubal sterilisation in terms of: 
‐ how unwell they made women feel in the short and long term, including pain experienced (major and minor morbidity); 
‐ failure rates (pregnancies);
‐ technical failures and difficulties encountered during the sterilisation procedure; and 
‐ women's and surgeons' satisfaction.
We searched the medical literature up to 23 July 2015 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any methods of closing the fallopian tubes; RCTs produce the most reliable results. 
Findings 
We included 19 RCTs involving 13,209 women of childbearing age. The trials compared:
‐ tubal rings versus clips (six RCTs, 4232 women);
‐ partial salpingectomy versus electrocoagulation (three RCTs, 2019 women);
‐ tubal rings versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 599 women);
‐ partial salpingectomy versus clips (four RCTs, 3827 women);
‐ clips versus electrocoagulation (two RCTs, 206 women); and
‐ two types of clips, i.e. Hulka clips versus Filshie clips (two RCTs, 2326 women).
We found no RCTs that investigated sterilisation by chemicals or tubal inserts, so all the included studies involved an abdominal operation.
