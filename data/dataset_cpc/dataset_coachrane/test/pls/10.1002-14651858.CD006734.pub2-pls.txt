Transmission of HIV from mother to child through breast milk
Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary way that children become infected with HIV.  Such transmission can take place when the child is still in the mother’s womb, around the time of birth, or through breastfeeding after birth.  Hundreds of thousands of children are infected this way every year, with most of them in developing countries.  Major progress has been made in preventing MTCT when the baby is still in the mother’s womb, or around the time the baby is born.  In many resource‐rich settings, mothers with HIV infection are counseled not to breastfeed their children, and there are feasible and affordable alternatives to breastfeeding.  However, in parts of the world where the vast majority of mothers with HIV infection live, complete avoidance of breastfeeding is often not feasible (for example, because of the lack of availability of clean water and of affordable replacement feeding).  Therefore, interventions to prevent transmission of HIV infection through breast milk are urgently needed.  The authors found that, in addition to complete avoidance of breastfeeding if safe and affordable, exclusive breastfeeding (where the baby receives only breast milk) for the first few months of life helps prevent transmission (as compared to breastfeeding supplemented by feeding the baby other liquids or solids).  Another intervention, giving the baby an anti‐HIV medicine (antiretroviral) while breastfeeding, decreases the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. Implementation of such interventions, as well as developing more and better interventions, is essential.
