Radiotherapy versus open surgery versus endolaryngeal surgery (with or without laser) for early larynx cancer 
Background 
Cancer of the larynx or voice box usually begins in the glottis (vocal cords) as a squamous cell cancer (cancer in the membranes). Most people survive these cancers when they get treatment early, before the cancer spreads further into the larynx and surrounding area. Options include radiotherapy, open surgery where access is through the neck or, more commonly now, endolaryngeal excision whereby the throat is reached through the mouth, sometimes with a laser. 
Study characteristics 
This review of trials identified just one trial including 234 patients with early glottic cancer, which compared radiotherapy to open surgery. This was a multicentre randomised controlled trial undertaken in the former Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Patients were followed up for five years and recurrence‐free and survival rates were measured. 
Key results 
The results of this trial showed that there was no significant difference in survival between patients treated with radiotherapy or open surgery. 
Further data from trials comparing radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery are needed to determine the best way of treating early laryngeal cancer, however a number of studies have been abandoned because of difficulties in recruiting participants. One trial is still ongoing. 
We found that there is not enough evidence to show which form of treatment might be better for people with early‐stage larynx cancer. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included study is of low quality. The evidence in this review is up to date to September 2014.
