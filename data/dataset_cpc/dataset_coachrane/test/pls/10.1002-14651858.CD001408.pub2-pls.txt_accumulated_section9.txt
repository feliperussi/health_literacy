Botulinum toxin type A injections for the treatment of lower limb spasticity in cerebral palsy 
Background 
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non‐progressive, lifelong condition resulting from damage to the developing brain. Over time, most children with CP will develop abnormal muscle activity and stiffness/overactivity (spasticity) that affects at least one limb and interferes with their normal movement. Treatments for spasticity include physiotherapy, oral antispasticity drugs (a type of medication that works to relax the muscles and relieve spasticity), casts, splints, orthopaedic surgery, and botulinum toxin A (BoNT‐A; a poisonous biological substance that is thought to relieve spasticity by reducing muscle overactivity when injected into the muscle). This review looked at the effects of BoNT‐A. 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to assess and summarise scientific studies comparing BoNT‐A injections to other treatments for lower limb spasticity in children with CP. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 studies assessing 1508 participants. The use of BoNT‐A in the lower limb muscles was compared to: (1) children's regular care or physiotherapy, (2) placebo (fake injections), (3) a series of below‐knee plaster casts, and (4) leg splints. 
Key results 
Children receiving BoNT‐A injections tended to have improved walking pattern (gait), joint range of motion, satisfaction with outcome of treatment, and muscle spasms compared with their usual programme of care or physiotherapy, or placebo. Measures of function tended to show only modest improvements in children receiving BoNT‐A injections. The rate of side effects was similar when comparing BoNT‐A injections to placebo. BoNT‐A injections and plaster casts below the knee produced similar benefits in walking and joint motion and relieving spasms. In addition, BoNT‐A provided better results in terms of joint range of motion compared to a specific type of splinting (Johnstone pressure splints).
