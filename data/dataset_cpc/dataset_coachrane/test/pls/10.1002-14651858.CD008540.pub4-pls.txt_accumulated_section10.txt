What is the best blood glucose target for pregnant women who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant? 
What is the issue? 
Pregnant women with diabetes need to keep their blood glucose levels stable, using diet, exercise, insulin or other drugs, clinic visits and monitoring. This review looked at the best blood glucose target for pregnant women with diabetes. 
Why is this important? 
Women who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes before they become pregnant have an increased risk of pregnancy loss, large babies, and babies dying. When a pregnant woman has high blood glucose and insulin resistance this can affect the development of the baby's heart and other organs. Babies born to diabetic mothers may also have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
Monitoring a diabetic pregnant woman's blood glucose level and staying within a target range may help to reduce these risks. We wanted to find out what the best blood glucose target is for pregnant women who had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found three small trials (in total 223 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes) looking at different blood glucose targets: very tight, tight, moderate, and loose. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was very low or low, so future research may change the results. 
There were very few differences between very tight and tight‐moderate blood glucose targets in two trials, although there were more cases of low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) and longer hospital stays for women who had very tight blood glucose control. 
A single trial compared tight, moderate, and loose blood glucose targets. In the loose target group, more women had pre‐eclampsia, and there were more caesareans and large babies. There were few differences between the tight and moderate groups, although more women in the tight control group had low blood glucose in the first half of pregnancy.
