Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia.
