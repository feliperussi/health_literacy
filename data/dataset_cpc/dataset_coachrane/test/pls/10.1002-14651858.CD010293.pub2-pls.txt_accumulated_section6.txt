Integrated compared with non‐integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if integrated orbital implants are better than non‐integrated orbital implants for treating anophthalmic sockets. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found three studies. 
Key messages There is uncertainty as to the benefits and harms of integrated compared with non‐integrated orbital implants.What was studied in the review? 'Anophthalmia' is the absence of the eye in the orbit. This can occur in childhood (because of problems with development) or it can happen during the course of life (due to an accident or other eye disease). 
Doctors can put an implant in the orbit to fill the void left by the removal of the eye and this together with an external prosthesis can improve the patient's appearance. This orbital implant can be made of two types of materials – integrated or non‐integrated material. If the material is integrated, then new blood vessels can grow into the implant material. If the material is non‐integrated, then the orbital implant remains separate from the rest of the orbit's tissue. 
The review authors looked to see if the type of implant material affected the success of the surgery or, in other words, if integrated implants can provide better results than non‐integrated implants. They were also interested in how much the external prosthesis could move better after surgery – using integrated or non‐integrated orbital implants. Also, the authors wanted to know if the type of orbital implant material can affect people's quality of life. Were there any adverse (harmful) effects of using integrated or non‐integrated orbital implants? 
What are the main results of the review? The type of material used for the orbital implant may not affect the success of the surgery (low‐certainty evidence). The review authors judged the evidence on prosthesis movement and adverse effects as providing very little certainty about the true effects. There was no information on quality of life.
