A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The active cycle of breathing technique uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review.

Study characteristics 
While 19 studies comparing the active cycle of breathing technique with other airway clearance therapies are included in the review, only five studies (192 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the five studies compared different techniques: the active cycle of breathing technique was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high‚Äêfrequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, and conventional chest physiotherapy. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (63%) were male. 
Key results 
We found that the active cycle of breathing technique was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference.
