Topical benzoyl peroxide for acne
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence showing effects and safety of topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO), used alone or in combination. Eligible comparisons included placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), no treatment, or other active (medical) topical medications for treating acne (used alone or in combination with other topical drugs not containing BPO) (evidence is current to February 2019). 
The main outcomes of interest in this review were participant‐reported acne improvement and withdrawal from the study due to any side effects. More generally, we also considered the percentage of participants experiencing any side effects over the whole course of a trial. 
Background 
As a common skin disease, acne vulgaris affects the physical, mental, and social well‐being of millions of adolescents and young adults. A wide range of treatments for acne vulgaris are available, and topical BPO has been recommended as a priority therapy to be used alone or combined with other topical or oral treatments, depending on acne severity. However, the benefits and harms of BPO have yet to be evaluated. 
Study characteristics 
We included 120 studies (which comprised 29,592 people randomised in 116 trials; in four trials the number of randomised participants was unclear). Through our search, we found studies assessing different concentrations of BPO, BPO delivered through various means, or BPO used alone or given with other treatments that may or may not be considered as the primary treatment. These studies compared treatments against different concentrations or formulations of BPO, placebo, no treatment, or other medical treatments given alone or in combination. 
Most of the studies included male and female participants with mild to moderate acne; only 67% of studies reported participant age, which ranged between 18 and 30 years. Participants were treated for over eight weeks in nearly two‐thirds of the trials. Industry financially supported approximately two‐fifths of the trials, and more than half of the trials did not report their funding sources. Few studies reported where they were set, but locations included hospitals, medical centres, national medical institutes, clinics, medical departments, and general practices.
