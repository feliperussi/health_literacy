Treatments for extreme tiredness and lack of energy (fatigue) in inflammatory bowel disease 
Review question 
What are the effects of drug and non‐drug treatments on fatigue in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to no treatment, placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) or active comparator (e.g. a known effective treatment)? 
Background 
IBD is a life‐long illness that causes inflammation and ulceration in the gut. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types of IBD. People living with IBD often experience fatigue, which can be burdensome and negatively impact on their quality of life. Different treatments, such as medications and exercise, may improve fatigue. However, it is unclear what the effects of such treatments on fatigue in IBD are. This review presents the available evidence of the effectiveness of treatments on fatigue in IBD. 
Search date 
Extensive searches were undertaken from inception up to July 2018. A top‐up search was run in October 2019. 
Study characteristics 
Fourteen studies (3741 participants with IBD) met the inclusion criteria. Nine different drug trials, four non‐drug trials and one multimodular trial were included in the review. Thirty ongoing studies were also identified and five studies are awaiting classification. In only four trials was managing fatigue the aim of the intervention. In the remaining trials the interventions were aimed at managing other symptoms, including fatigue. Data on fatigue were not available for the fourteen trials, therefore, the findings of this review are based on 1344 participants in nine trials. Most studies were small in size and had low or very low quality of evidence. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
The evidence suggests electroacupuncture may result in a large reduction in fatigue compared to control and sham electroacupuncture, however, the overall certainty of the evidence is low due to sparse data. No adverse events were reported, except for one adverse event in the sham acupuncture group. 
We are very uncertain about the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy and solution‐focused therapy on fatigue, as the quality of the evidence is very low. 
One small study found that physical activity advice plus omega 3 and physical activity advice plus placebo may reduce fatigue compared to no physical activity advice plus omega 3. Adverse events were similar across physical activity groups, although more adverse events were reported in the no physical activity advice plus omega 3 group. Adverse events were mainly mild gastrointestinal events like diarrhoea and bloating 
Compared with placebo, the drug alimumab 40 mg, administered every other week, may reduce fatigue in patients with moderately‐to‐severely active Crohn's disease, who are already known to respond to adalimumab treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. People taking adalimumab 40 mg weekly were less like to experience serious adverse events or withdraw from the trial due to adverse events, compared to people taking placebo.
