More than 1000 elective liver resections (planned operation) are performed annually in the United Kingdom alone. When liver resection is performed, the inflow of blood to the liver can be blocked (vascular occlusion), thereby reducing the blood loss. There are concerns about liver damage when the blood supply is blocked. Ischaemic preconditioning involves ischaemia (blocking the blood supply) and reperfusion (unblocking the blood supply) for a short period of time before exposure to prolonged vascular occlusion. The aim of this review was to assess the role of ischaemic preconditioning in liver resections performed utilising vascular occlusion. Four randomised clinical trials including 271 patients undergoing open liver resections fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. The patients were randomised to ischaemic preconditioning (n = 135) and no ischaemic preconditioning (n = 136) prior to continuous vascular occlusion. All the trials excluded cirrhotic patients. We assessed all the four trials as having high risk of bias (high risk of systematic error). There was no difference in mortality, liver failure, post‐operative complications, hospital stay, intensive therapy unit stay, and operating time between the two groups. The proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion was lower in the ischaemic preconditioning group. The reasons for this are not clear. There was no difference in blood loss or enzyme markers of liver function between the two groups. The enzyme markers of liver injury were lower in the ischaemic preconditioning group on the first post‐operative day. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest a protective effect of ischaemic preconditioning in non‐cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection under continuous vascular occlusion. Ischaemic preconditioning reduces the blood transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver resection. Further high quality randomised clinical trials are necessary to assess the role of ischaemic preconditioning. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanism of ischaemic preconditioning.
