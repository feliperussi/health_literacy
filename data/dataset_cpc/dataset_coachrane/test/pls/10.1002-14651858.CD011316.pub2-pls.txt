Stopping long‐acting beta2‐agonists for children with asthma well controlled on combination therapy 
Background 
Asthma is the most common long‐term medical condition in children. Poorly controlled asthma often leads to flare‐ups that require extra treatment, hospital stays, or treatment in the emergency department. 
Long‐acting beta2‐agonists (LABA) are an inhaled treatment that can be added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for children with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on ICS alone. The US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning for the use of LABA in asthma after serious safety concerns emerged, and now recommends that they be used for the shortest time possible, and stopped when the child's asthma improves. 
Review question 
We looked for studies comparing a group of children who stopped taking their LABA with a group who continued taking ICS plus LABA. We were mainly interested in whether there is an effect on asthma control and side effects of stopping LABA. 
Studies had to be at least eight weeks' long and include children whose asthma was well controlled on any dose of ICS plus LABA. 
Two review authors independently screened all records found in the searches, which were done in April 2015. 
Results 
We found no studies matching the criteria above.
We screened 1031 records and read the full text of 43 articles we thought looked relevant, but could include none. We found several adult studies, which will be summarised in a separate review (Ahmad 2014). 
Some adult studies included adolescents from age 15, but none reported data separately for those under 18. 
Conclusion 
There is currently no evidence from randomised studies looking at stopping LABA in children whose asthma is well controlled on ICS plus LABA, which is disappointing given the importance of the question. 
We will summarise studies in adults in a separate review (Ahmad 2014).
