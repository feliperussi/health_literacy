Time spent in rehabilitation and effect on measures of activity after stroke
Review questionDoes more time spent in rehabilitation improve activity? What matters? Is it the total time spent in rehabilitation that is important, or is it the way rehabilitation is delivered (the schedule)? Is it, for example, the amount of time spent per week? Or the frequency of sessions? 
BackgroundStroke rehabilitation helps people who have had a stroke to recover and resume their activities. Different countries have different guidelines about the amount of therapy they should receive. In England, a minimum of 45 minutes of each appropriate therapy, every day is recommended. In Canada, the guidelines recommend more – three hours of task‐specific training, five days per week. Previous research has found no clear evidence in favour of one approach or the other: the effect of total time spent in rehabilitation, or the schedule by which it is delivered. The English recommendation of 45 minutes is based on the results of studies that compared different types of rehabilitation as well as different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation – which is not the same thing. This is why our review compares only different amounts of the same type of stroke rehabilitation. 
Study characteristicsWe included 21 studies amounting to 1412 people with stroke. Each study compared groups of people who had received different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation. Different types of rehabilitation were included, but the comparison within each study was always only different amounts of the same type. We included rehabilitation of the arms, legs, walking, and general rehabilitation. In 16 studies, participants were in the first six months after stroke. In the remaining five studies, participants were more than six months after stroke. 
Search dateWe searched for studies up to June 2021. 
Key resultsWe found that, for measures of activities involved in daily living (e.g. washing and dressing), activity measures of the arm (e.g. picking up an item), and activity measures of the leg (e.g. walking) there was neither harm to nor benefit for groups that received more rehabilitation compared with groups that received less. For measures of movement of the arm and leg (e.g. strength or range of movement), there was a benefit from receiving more rehabilitation. However, when we compared only the studies that had a bigger contrast between groups, there was a beneficial effect from additional therapy in terms of daily living activities, activity measures of the arm and leg, and movement measures of the arm. This suggests that people with stroke need a large amount of extra rehabilitation for it to make a difference in their recovery and ability to do everyday activities.
