Adhesively or non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries
Review question 
Does adding adhesive designed to bond dental amalgam fillings to teeth make the fillings perform better and last longer than fillings without it? 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common problem affecting both children and adults. Cavities form in the teeth by the action of acid produced by bacteria present in dental plaque or biofilm. 
A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of the most commonly used and comparatively cheap filling materials is dental amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). The review authors sought to evaluate the added benefit of using an adhesive to bond amalgam to tooth structure to see if bonded fillings would last longer and perform better. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group, is up to date as of 21 January 2016. One trial with 31 participants (21 male, 10 female) who received 113 restorations was included. The study took place in the UK in a university dental hospital environment. Participants were chosen who were suitable for routine dental treatment. The comparison made was between teeth in the same person on opposite sides of the mouth, one treated with the bonded technique, the other without. At two years no difference was found. 
Key results 
Only one study, which provided limited information, showed that for medium sized fillings there was no difference in sensitivity between the bonded and non‐bonded fillings after their placement and that bonding of amalgam to tooth did not have any effect on the survival of the filling over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. 
There is a wide range of bonding agents developed over a number of years that are available for use by dentists. It is therefore very disappointing that there is such a lack of suitable trials of their effectiveness. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was only one included study and it provides insufficient evidence that adhesively bonded amalgam restorations perform any better than non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restoration when followed up for two years. 
The quality of the evidence is low. In addition, the university dental clinic setting may mean that the participants are not representative of the general population and the treatment offered not typical of that in general dental practice so the results may not be generalisable.
