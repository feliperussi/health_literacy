Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) affects around 10% of children under five years of age in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Different food strategies have been used for the nutritional recovery of children with MAM, such as lipid‐based nutrient supplements or blended foods, which can be provided in full dose or in a low dose as a complement to the usual diet. However, there is no definitive consensus on the most effective way to treat children with MAM. 
We searched eight electronic databases and three trials registers (in October 2012 for all except Embase, which was searched in August 2012). We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted nutrition‐related organisations and researchers in this field. 
We found eight relevant randomised controlled trials, enrolling 10,037 children under five years of age. All but one study was conducted in Africa. 
The risk of bias in the studies was generally low, though two studies had a high dropout rate. The participants were aware which intervention group they were in and this may have influenced their behaviour but we thought it unlikely it would have influenced the results since the outcomes measured were objective ones. For four of the studies, we were unable to assess if the study authors reported all the outcomes they intended to measure. 
When any type of specially formulated food was compared to standard care (medical care and counselling without foods), the children treated with foods had a higher chance of recovering from moderate malnutrition (two studies), greater improvement in nutritional status (two studies), and a lower number of dropouts (one study). A reduction in mortality was not shown.
