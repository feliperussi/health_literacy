Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
People with long‐term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long‐term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long‐term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long‐term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long‐term physical conditions who had a history of depression. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty.
