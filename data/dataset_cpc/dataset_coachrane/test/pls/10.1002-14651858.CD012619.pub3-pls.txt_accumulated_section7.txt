Which interventions are effective and safe for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, life‚Äêlong condition that causes organ systems in the body to produce large amounts of thick and sticky mucus. The most commonly affected area is the lungs, in which thick mucus leads to recurrent chest infections and breathing difficulties. Another commonly affected area is the digestive system. Many people with CF suffer from bloating and abdominal pain which may be caused by constipation or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In DIOS, overproduction of thick mucus combines with stool and sticks to the intestinal wall. This mass can partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). The latter causes severe pain, vomiting and is treated as a medical emergency. As part of effective care for people with CF, constipation should therefore be treated and complete bowel obstruction be prevented. It is also important to recognise that constipation and DIOS impact on other aspects of CF health. Bloating, abdominal pain and nausea may affect airway clearance, exercise and sleep. Nutritional status may also be affected due to decreased appetite and malabsorption. DIOS may affect the absorption of other medications taken by people with CF. Overall, DIOS can significantly impair quality of life. Different laxatives are currently used in clinics, but prescribing practices differ and there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategies. Hence, this review aimed to analyse the evidence for the preventing DIOS.

Trial characteristics 
We included one trial in the review, which included 17 people aged between 13 to 35 years. These people were randomly put into groups to take either a placebo drug (with no active medication) or cisapride for six months each and then to cross over and take the alternative treatment for a further six months.
