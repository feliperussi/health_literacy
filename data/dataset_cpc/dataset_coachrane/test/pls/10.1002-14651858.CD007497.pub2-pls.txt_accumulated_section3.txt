Low dose versus high dose stavudine for treating people with HIV infection
Stavudine has been the most widely used antiretroviral agent as part of the combination therapy for treating HIV‐1 infection in low‐income countries. The use of stavudine has been associated with complications of redistribution of fat in the body, abnormalities in insulin and lipids, lactic acidosis and nerve problems. Some of these complications may be life‐threatening. Strategies to avoid or reduce the risk of these complications have included using alternative drugs where available or using lower doses of the stavudine. 
The comprehensive search strategy developed by the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group was used to identify trials that compared the safety and efficacy in suppressing the viral load of low dose versus high dose stavudine in the context of treating HIV‐1 with combination antiretroviral therapy. The searches covered the period 1996 to 2014.The search identified 3952 trials and only three met the inclusion criteria, all the included trials were conducted in developed countries, the number of participants ranged from 24 to 92 and the majority were male. The efficacy of suppressing the viral load was found to be the same in all the trials whether high dose or low dose of stavudine was used. McComsey 2008 and Milinkovic 2007 demonstrated a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), reduction in limb fat and an increase in triglycerides in the high dose arms. While there was no demonstration of a difference in efficacy of viral load suppression between high dose and low dose stavudine in the included trials, participants included in these trials were already treated with antiretroviral therapy and had suppressed viral load. The fact that participants already had suppression of the viral load and the studies were small, meant it would be difficult to demonstrate the differences in viral load suppression between the two groups. The studies did not indicate that any participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events.
