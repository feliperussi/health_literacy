Side effects of opioid drugs when used to treat chronic non‐cancer pain in the medium‐ or long‐term 
Bottom line 
There is good‐quality evidence showing that side effects can occur in people with chronic non‐cancer pain who use opioid medicines for longer than two weeks. 
Background 
Opioids are a type of pain medicine related to opium. We conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews, which are a type of scientific paper, to learn what these papers said about the side effects of opioid drugs. We were interested in the medium‐ and long‐term side effects with this treatment for pain in adults who use opioid medicines who have chronic pain that is not due to cancer. We studied opioid medications compared to pills that do not contain any medicine (placebos) and opioid medications compared to other treatments. 
Key results 
In March 2017, we found 16 Cochrane Reviews of 14 different opioid medicines, including codeine, morphine, and oxycodone. These papers included 61 studies with more than 18,000 participants. We found that people who take opioids have a higher risk of having any side effect, such as constipation, dizziness, and nausea, as well as having a serious side effect. We did not find any information in the Cochrane Reviews about many of the known and sometimes serious side effects of opioids, such as addiction, depression, and sleep problems. 
Quality of the reviews and the evidence 
We rated the quality of the included reviews out of 10 points. As all of the reviews scored 9 or 10 out of 10, we are confident that the quality of the included reviews is very good. We also rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high; these ratings showed how sure we could be about our results for the side effects of opioids. Very low‐quality evidence meant that we are very unsure about the results. High‐quality evidence meant that we are very sure of the results. All of our ratings were between very low and moderate.
