Interventions to prevent embryos from being expelled after transfer in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
Review question 
In women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) what are the best methods to prevent embryos from being expelled after the embryo transfer (ET) procedure? 
Background 
In recent years assisted reproduction has become more evidence based in an attempt to determine what techniques truly work. This has led to major changes in the way embryos are transferred and what therapies are given to women before and after the transfer. Even so, one aspect that is still not well established is whether or not there are ways to decrease the movement or expulsion rate of embryos from the uterus following transfer. Based on this lack of information, combined with the need to clearly improve outcomes by reducing the risk of losing embryos following transfer, Cochrane authors decided to systematically locate and review the best available evidence regarding interventions for the prevention of embryo expulsion in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. 
Study characteristics 
Following meticulous searches of major databases (all databases searched June 2013, MDSG register last searched June 2014) and conference proceedings we were able to locate four trials, with a total of 1392 women. These were all prospective, randomised controlled trials comparing two competing post‚ÄêET interventions or an intervention versus no treatment on clinical outcomes in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Each study recruited from 164 to 639 infertile women of reproductive age and all were conducted in IVF centres; none of them had conflicts of interest regarding study funding.
