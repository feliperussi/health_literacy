Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women
Some women develop a breast abscess while breastfeeding, called a lactational breast abscess. An abscess is a collection of infected fluid within the breast tissue. The aim of treatment is to cure the abscess quickly and effectively, ensuring maximum benefit to the mother with minimal interruption of breastfeeding. 
Presently, lactational breast abscesses are treated by incision and drainage or needle aspiration, with or without diagnostic ultrasound. Antibiotics may or may not be prescribed. For incision and drainage the abscess is cut open with a scalpel (blade) to release the infected fluid. A drain may be inserted into the wound to help the infected fluid drain or may be left open so that the infected fluid drains naturally. A less invasive way to treat the breast abscess is by needle aspiration. A needle is inserted into the cavity of the breast abscess and a syringe is used to draw out the infected fluid, often using ultrasound guidance. As there are advantages in using this method e.g. no scars, reduced hospitalisation etc. the trend is to use this method more often. 
We wanted to find evidence on the effectiveness of different treatments. We looked at the time taken for the abscess to heal using the different types of treatments, the number of women who continued to breastfeed after treatment and how many women had healed in the each group after treatment. The definition of healing varied across the studies. 
We found six studies, of which four studies with a total of 325 woman contributed data. These studies compared needle aspiration versus incision and drainage. Needle aspiration appeared to decrease the healing time compared to incision and drainage, but large proportions of women were excluded from the analysis and it was therefore difficult to make conclusions. For the outcome continuation of breastfeeding, both of the studies showed that women treated with needle aspiration were more likely to continue breastfeeding compared to incision and drainage. In two studies, breast abscesses did not heal in some women who had needle aspiration and had to be treated with incision and drainage (low quality evidence). All breast abscesses that were treated with incision and drainage healed. We were not able to make any conclusions regarding unwanted effects or complications. Studies did not report sufficiently on the number of follow‐up visits, duration of continuation of breastfeeding, post‐operative complications, duration of hospital stay and adverse events. However, it appeared that women were more satisfied when treated with needle aspiration.
