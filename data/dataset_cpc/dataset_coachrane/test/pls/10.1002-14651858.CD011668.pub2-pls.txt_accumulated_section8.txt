Transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal tumours in adults 
Review question 
What are the effects of laparoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy compared with laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy in adults? 
Background 
The adrenal glands are found above the kidneys, and produce several hormones, such as adrenaline, aldosterone, and cortisol. A tumour of the adrenal gland may be benign or cancerous, and is often found during routine examinations, such as ultrasonography of the belly (abdomen). The surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) is usually recommended if the adrenal mass is more than 4 cm in diameter, if the mass enlarges by 1 cm or more during the period of observation, or if evidence of autonomous hormonal secretion develops. 
There are several techniques to remove an adrenal gland. Nowadays, surgeons most often use keyhole surgery (laparoscopic surgery) instead of open surgery, using small cuts in the belly to introduce special surgical instruments and a small camera (laparoscope) with light. Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy uses a cut through the belly that includes cutting a special membrane inside the belly (peritoneum) to expose the adrenal gland. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy approaches the adrenal gland from the back, without cutting the peritoneum. Advocates of the latter technique have proposed better results, like shorter operative time, less blood loss, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 244 participants. A total of 127 participants were randomised to retroperitoneal adrenalectomy and 117 participants to transperitoneal adrenalectomy. Two studies had an observation period after surgery of nine months. Three studies observed their participants for 31 to 70 months. Most participants were women, and the average age was around 40 years.
