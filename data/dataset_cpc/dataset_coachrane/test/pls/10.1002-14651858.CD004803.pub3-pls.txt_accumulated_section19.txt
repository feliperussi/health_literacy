Retention versus sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament in total knee replacement for the treatment of osteoarthritis 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration have conducted a review of two types of knee replacement surgery for people with knee osteoarthritis. In one type, the posterior cruciate ligament is kept and in the other, it is removed. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 17 studies with up to 1810 patients. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved during total knee replacement surgery: 
‐ this may not improve their range of motion, pain, function and patient satisfaction compared with removing the ligament. 
We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, especially rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include infection, pain, and the need to have further surgery. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is the posterior cruciate ligament? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone may grow abnormally to try and repair the damage and make things worse. For example, it can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis may be severe enough to require surgery. In total knee replacement surgery, a surgeon removes the damaged joint surface and replaces it with a metal and plastic implant. 
The posterior cruciate ligament provides support and stable movement of the knee. In total knee replacement surgery, the posterior cruciate ligament can be kept in place or removed. This choice depends on the condition of the ligament, the type of total knee replacement selected or preference of the surgeon. When the ligament is removed, a special peg is used to provide stability and give your knee forward and backward movement with the tibia stabilised in relation to the femur. 
What happens to people who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed during total knee replacement surgery 
Range of motion (range of motion is the distance your knee can move from being bent to being fully extended. A lower range of motion is worse; you can’t bend or stretch your knee fully) 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had 2 ° less range of motion compared to those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance  ‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed had a range of motion of 118 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 ° ‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had a range of motion of 116 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 ° 
Knee pain (lower score means worse pain) 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their pain to be the same as those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their pain to be 48 on a scale of 0 to 50 
Health related quality of life and functional measures (higher means worse) 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 1 point worse than those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 16 on a scale of 0 to 100 
‐ People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed rated their quality of life to be 15 on a scale of 0 to 100
