What is the best way to use topical corticosteroids to treat people with eczema?
Key messages 
‐ Generally, stronger topical corticosteroids (steroid cream applied to the skin) are probably more effective than weaker preparations. Strong steroid cream applied once daily is probably as good as twice daily, and using steroid cream for two consecutive days weekly probably prevents eczema flare‐ups. 
‐ About a third of studies looked for skin thinning, but cases were very low. This made it difficult to judge differences between strategies, although there were more cases with stronger steroid cream. 
‐ We need better‐quality research on unwanted effects, over longer timeframes, but intermittent use of steroid cream probably causes fewer unwanted effects. 
What is eczema and how is it treated? 
Eczema is a common, long‐lasting condition that results in inflamed, dry, itchy patches of skin and its severity varies; it is incurable currently, so treatment aims to control symptoms (inflammation and itching). The first choice of treatment is emollients (moisturisers) combined with treatment to reduce inflammation, often steroid cream. 
What did we want to find out? 
Steroid creams can be used in different ways to treat eczema, and people often feel confused about which ones to use, and how often and how best to use them. We wanted to investigate the effectiveness of different ways (strategies) of using steroid cream and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We summarised evidence from studies that tested different ways of using steroid cream in adults and children. We assessed treatment strategies based on changes in eczema severity assessed by doctors/researchers or participants, and unwanted effects, such as skin thinning (the skin may bruise and tear more easily). We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as trial methods and sizes.
