Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy
Review question 
What are the effects of corticosteroids on Bell's palsy?
Background 
Bell's palsy is a paralysis or weakness of muscles in the face, usually on one side, with no certain cause. Symptoms usually recover, although not always. Reducing inflammation of the facial nerve using corticosteroid medicines (steroids) is thought to limit nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010. 
Study characteristics 
We identified seven clinical trials involving 895 people with one‚Äêsided mild, moderate or severe Bell's palsy of unknown cause. All of these trials reported rates of incomplete recovery (the proportion of people left with facial weakness) and we were able to combine the results. People in the studies were aged from 2 to 84 years. They were treated with corticosteroids or placebo (inactive treatment), either alone or in combination with other therapies. One trial only involved children, from 24 months to 74 months old. The duration of the included studies for adults and children ranged from 157 days to 12 months. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Incomplete recovery 
According to moderate quality to high quality evidence, corticosteroids reduced the number of people left with facial weakness after Bell's palsy compared to placebo (a pretend medicine). This finding was based on data from seven studies involving 895 participants with Bell's palsy of varying degrees of severity. We calculated that to stop one person from being left with facial weakness, 10 people need to be treated.
