Interventions for helping older adults prescribed multiple medications to use and take their medications 
Background: Older people are often prescribed multiple medications, which can be challenging to manage. Medication‐taking errors and non‐adherence (under‐use or over‐use of medication) can lead to negative health outcomes. Assisting older people to better use and adhere to their medications could reduce adverse medication events, such as medication‐related hospital admissions, and could improve health outcomes. 
Question: What are the findings of studies testing ways to improve older people's ability to use and adhere to multiple medications? 
Search strategy: To find relevant studies, we searched seven online databases, trial registries, and the reference lists of previous reviews, retrieving studies published until June 2019. 
Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or studies of similar design comparing a group of people receiving an intervention to improve medication‐taking ability or medication adherence with a group receiving usual care (no intervention) or receiving a different intervention. We included trials that studied older adults (≥ 65 years) living at home (or being discharged from hospital back to home) who were using four or more regular prescription medications. 
Main results: We identified 50 studies, involving 14,269 participants. All studies tested interventions versus usual care, with six studies also comparing two different types of interventions. 
Fourteen studies tested educational interventions whereby people received education regarding their medications or a health professional reviewed their medications. Seven studies tested behavioural interventions such as changing dosing times, re‐packaging medications into multi‐compartment pill boxes to make medication regimens easier to take, or sending text message adherence reminders. Twenty‐nine studies tested mixed educational and behavioural interventions.
