Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
What are the effects of ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon (class I) mutations) on clinical outcomes (quality of life, lung function and adverse effects) in people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis, the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is faulty. In particular, this affects the airways, which become dehydrated making it difficult to clear thick mucus, which in turn leads to progressive lung infection and damage and a reduction in life expectancy. Ataluren and similar compounds can mask the abnormal gene sequence and may be able to restore production of the faulty protein in people with certain cystic fibrosis mutations (premature termination codon (class I) mutations). These treatments aim to help the airways retain more water allowing them to clear the mucus better, so that these people develop fewer lung infections.

Study characteristics 
We found one trial (238 people took part) comparing ataluren to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication). The trial lasted 48 weeks and included both males and females aged six years and older. Everyone taking part had at least one copy of a nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation that causes cystic fibrosis). 
Key Results 
In those people who took ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight. The trial found that kidney damage was more common in people who took ataluren. The trial investigators then analysed the results in a way that they hadn't planned originally and looked at how ataluren or placebo affected people depending on whether they were using inhaled tobramycin on a long‐term basis or not. They found that amongst those not taking inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations in the ataluren group compared to the placebo group. 
We have not found enough high‐quality evidence currently to determine the effect of ataluren for treating people with cystic fibrosis. We recommend that future trials are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be included in a systematic review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence was moderate with uncertainty due to how widely the results varied between participants. We are satisfied that everyone taking part had an equal chance of being in either group (ataluren or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into, so that healthier people did not receive the treatment and make the results seem better. We believe that the clinicians running the trial and those taking part in the trial did not know which treatment each person was receiving. We have some concerns on the emphasis the investigators have placed on the results of a comparison they had not planned (use of long‐term inhaled tobramycin). Unfortunately, the trial did not report all their results clearly; sometimes they did not report them in a way that we could use in the review and sometimes they did not report the data at all. This affected the certainty with which we judged the overall results. 
Trial Funding Sources 
The trial was sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) also supported the trial.
