Breathing exercises for children with asthma
Background 
Asthma is a chronic (persistent) inflammatory disease of the lungs that can lead to airflow obstruction (blockage) causing difficulty in breathing. The worldwide high prevalence of asthma has become a public health problem due to the great healthcare costs resulting from hospitalisation and medicines. Moreover, asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. Breathing exercises are a non‚Äêdrug treatment that have been routinely used in the treatment of people with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the hyperventilation (overbreathing) symptoms of asthma and can include the Papworth method, Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar method that focusses on changing the breathing pattern. 
Review question 
We wanted to look at the evidence for the effects of breathing exercises in children with asthma. 
Key results 
We found three studies involving 112 children with mild to severe asthma. All the included studies compared breathing exercises as part of a more complex treatment (inspiratory muscle training, relaxation exercises, endurance exercises, rhythmic mobilization exercises, vibrations, percussion, forced expiration technique) versus control. The studies varied in size from 28 to 60 children. Samples consisted of inpatients and outpatients. The control groups received different treatments: one received placebo (pretend) treatment, one an educational programme and doctor appointments, and one was not described. We found no primary outcomes (measures of quality of life, asthma symptoms and side effects of treatment) that were reported as comparisons between the treatment and control groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies had an overall small number of participants and sessions. No included study compared breathing exercises alone versus a control. Instead, breathing exercises were part of a package of treatments and were compared to a control. The methods used to conduct the studies were not as well reported as we would like and so were unclear about the quality of the trials. Overall, we judged the included studies as being at an unclear risk of bias and the quality of the evidence included in the review was low. 
Conclusion 
We could draw no reliable conclusions concerning the use of breathing exercises for children with asthma in clinical practice.
