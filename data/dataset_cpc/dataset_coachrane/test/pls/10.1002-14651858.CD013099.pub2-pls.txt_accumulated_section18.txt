What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for bacterial folliculitis and boils (inflammation of the skin around hairs)? 
Why is this question important? 
Bacterial folliculitis is an inflammation of the tiny pockets in our skin from which hairs grow (hair follicles). It occurs when bacteria (tiny organisms not visible with the naked eye) infect hair follicles. Bacterial folliculitis typically causes red swelling, with or without a small blister that contains pus. 
Without treatment, bacterial folliculitis may progress to hard and painful lumps filled with pus, known as boils. These cover several hair follicles, and affect the skin around them. 
Bacterial folliculitis and boils affect people worldwide, and have an important negative impact on quality of life. Infections typically: 
‐ cause unsightly infections on parts of the body visible to others (such as the face and neck); or 
‐ develop where skin rubs, causing discomfort and pain (such as armpits and buttocks).
A range of treatment options for bacterial folliculitis and boils is available. These include: 
‐ antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections). These can be applied to part of the body (locally) in the form of creams (topical antibiotics); or they can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as injections, to treat the whole body (systemic antibiotics); 
‐ antiseptics (chemicals applied to the skin to fight infections caused by micro‐organisms, such as bacteria); 
‐ light therapy; and
‐ surgery, for example, doctors may make a small cut (incision) in the skin to allow pus to drain out. 
To find out which treatments work best for bacterial folliculitis and boils, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatments were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that involved a total of 1300 people. People were followed‐up for between one week and three months. Studies were set in Asia, Europe and America. Only three studies reported information about funding: non‐profit organisations funded one study, and pharmaceutical companies funded two studies.
