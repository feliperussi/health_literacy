How accurate are screening tests in identifying those at risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of primary angle closure glaucoma important?Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. If untreated, glaucoma can lead to blindness. Primary angle closure glaucoma is a type of glaucoma, where the drainage route for the fluid inside the eye (known as the angle) is narrowed or blocked, leading to raised eye pressure and loss of the field of vision. Primary angle closure glaucoma accounts for a quarter of all cases of glaucoma globally and it is more likely to lead to vision loss than the more common form, primary open angle glaucoma. 
A variety of non‐invasive tests are available to identify people at risk of primary angle closure glaucoma in a community or non‐specialist clinical setting. Those who test positive are referred for further specialist investigation and possible treatment. Failure to detect this condition (a false negative result) may result in an increased risk of progressive optic nerve damage and blindness. An incorrect diagnosis (a false positive result) could lead to unnecessary and costly investigation. 
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this review was to find out how accurate non‐invasive screening tests are in identifying those at risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma. 
What was studied in this review? Five non‐invasive tests were studied. These range from simple tests that require either a pen torch or a widely available piece of clinical equipment known as a slit ‐lamp microscope (oblique flashlight test; limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD)) to more sophisticated imaging equipment (anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS‐OCT), Scheimpflug photography and scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyser (SPAC)) that can scan and measure the dimensions of the drainage angle. 
What were the main results in this review?The review included 47 relevant studies, with a total of 26,151 participants. Twenty‐seven studies assessed AS‐OCT, 17 studies assessed LACD, nine studies Scheimpflug photography, six studies SPAC and five studies evaluated the flashlight test. 
The overall diagnostic performance of LACD was similar to the more advanced imaging technologies, AS‐OCT, Scheimpflug photography and SPAC, however, the flashlight test showed an inferior performance. Using LACD as an example, if this test was performed on 1000 people, of whom 100 were at risk of primary angle closure, an estimated 83 would be correctly identified and 17 cases would be missed (false negatives). The test would correctly identify 792 of the 900 not at risk of angle closure glaucoma and incorrectly classify 108 (12%), who would be unnecessarily referred (false positives). 
How reliable were the results of the studies in this review?Most studies were of low quality due to the way that the participants were recruited or how the tests were performed. This could have led to the tests appearing more accurate than what they really are. We can therefore not be sure that the tests will always produce the reported results. 
What are the implications of this review?The studies included in this review were mostly conducted in Asia, which carries the greatest burden of primary angle closure glaucoma. The results of this review have shown that LACD, which is a quick and simple test that can be performed with a minimal amount of training, can identify people at risk of primary angle closure glaucoma, leading to early and appropriate treatment. Although this test could potentially miss approximately one in six of those at risk of the condition and lead to an over referral of 12%, the test could be useful for targeted screening in areas with a high prevalence of the condition.
