Does repair of torn rotator cuff tendons work?
Review question 
To assess the effect of surgical repair of rotator cuff tendons on shoulder pain, function and other outcomes in adults with full‐thickness rotator cuff tears compared with non‐surgical management. 
Background 
The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that move the shoulder joint. Some people have pain in their shoulder related to wear and tear of the rotator cuff tendons. The weakening of the tendon is thought to be caused by aging and mechanical wear. Eventually, the process may result in a tear of the tendons. 
Rotator cuff tears can cause pain and impair arm function but asymptomatic tears also occur. For people with symptomatic tears, non‐operative management including pain medicines (simple analgesia and anti‐inflammatories), glucocorticoid injections and physical therapies do not always result in satisfactory outcomes. 
Surgery is usually considered when other treatments fail. Surgery includes removing part of the bone to broaden the tendon passage (subacromial decompression) and repair of the torn tendons. Sometimes the surgeons cannot repair the tendon due to the size of the tear or degeneration of the muscle, and in these cases only subacromial decompression may be performed. Most rotator cuff surgery is now performed arthroscopically (surgical instruments are inserted through small key holes to perform surgery) or through small incisions (mini‐open approach). 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to January 2019. We found nine trials with 1007 participants. Participants mean age was 56 to 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. The participants had symptoms for several months or years and were diagnosed with a full‐thickness tear with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound examination. Studies were conducted in Finland, Norway, Canada, USA, France, the Netherlands, Italy and South Korea. Our primary analysis included three trials with 339 participants who received either surgery (tendon repair and removal of bone from undersurface of acromion) or non‐operative therapy (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Three studies received funding however none of them reported using the funds directly for these trials. 
Key results 
Compared with non‐operative treatment, surgery resulted in little or no benefit in people with rotator cuff tears for up to one year.
