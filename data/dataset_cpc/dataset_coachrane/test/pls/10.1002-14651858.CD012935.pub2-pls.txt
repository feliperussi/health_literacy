Diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support for preventing respiratory failure in preterm infants 
Review question 
In preterm infants, does diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support compared with other modes of non‐invasive respiratory support prevent respiratory failure? 
Background 
Diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support uses the electrical signal from the breathing muscles to guide when an infant is trying to breathe. This gives infants support that is both timed with their breathing efforts and in proportion to how hard they are working to breathe. It has the potential to help infants avoid invasive breathing support with a breathing tube. It is currently unclear whether there is a beneficial effect on outcomes for preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 studies that assessed the effect of diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support in infants through searches of medical databases up to 10 May 2019. Of these 15, two studies (involving a total of 23 preterm infants) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Ten studies were either awaiting publication or are ongoing. 
Key results 
There is limited data from randomised controlled trials to determine the effect of diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support on important outcomes. We were able to include only two small randomised controlled trials in the review. Both studies involved infants switching from one type of support to the other and were focused on short‐term changes in breathing patterns. 
Quality of evidence 
We were not able to make any meaningful conclusions in this review due to limited data and very low quality evidence. Large, high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether diaphragm‐triggered non‐invasive respiratory support can prevent respiratory failure.
