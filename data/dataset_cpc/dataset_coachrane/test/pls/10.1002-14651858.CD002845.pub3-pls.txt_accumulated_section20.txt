Do antifungal medicines for vaginal yeast infections (thrush) work better if taken by mouth (orally) or placed in the vagina (intravaginally)? 
What is thrush? 
Thrush (also called candidiasis) is a common vaginal infection caused by a type of fungus called a yeast. Symptoms include itching and irritation around the vagina and a white discharge. Thrush is usually harmless but it can be uncomfortable. 
Thrush is usually treated with antifungal medicines. These can be taken by mouth (orally) or placed in the vagina (intravaginally). 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if oral antifungal medicines work better than intravaginal antifungal medicines to treat thrush infections. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies of antifungal medicines to treat thrush that compared an oral antifungal with an intravaginal antifungal. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatments. 
We were interested in how well ‐ and how fast ‐ antifungal medicines could get rid of yeast infections and improve symptoms; whether they had any unwanted effects; and whether women preferred oral or intravaginal treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 29 August 2019. 
What we found 
We found 26 studies in 5007 women with thrush who were treated with antifungal medicines called azoles. The studies were conducted in Europe, the USA, Thailand, Iran, Japan and Nigeria. Eight azoles were studied: 2 oral (fluconazole and itraconazole) and 6 intravaginal (butoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, sertaconazole and terconazole). 
The studies measured whether oral and intravaginal antifungal medicines led to:
• no symptoms (clinical cure);• no yeasts found in the vagina (mycological cure); or• unwanted effects that caused women to stop treatment. 
No studies reported the costs of the oral or intravaginal antifungal medicines.
What are the results of our review? 
Clinical cure (no symptoms) was similar for oral and intravaginal antifungal medicines in both the short term (5 to 15 days; 13 studies), and long term (2 to 12 weeks; 9 studies). Whether an antifungal medicine is oral or intravaginal probably makes little to no difference to getting rid of thrush symptoms. 
However, oral antifungal medicines probably cleared yeast from the vagina (mycological cure) better than intravaginal ones in both the short term (19 studies) and long term (13 studies). 
Only three women stopped using their antifungal medicine because of unwanted effects (23 studies); the risk of women stopping treatment with oral or intravaginal antifungal medicines is low.
