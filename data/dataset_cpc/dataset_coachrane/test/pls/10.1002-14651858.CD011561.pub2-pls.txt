In children with liver disease, who have enlarged veins in the oesophagus (food pipe), does placing an elastic ring around the vein prevent it from bleeding? 
Bleeding in the oesophagusA blood clot in the veins that drain blood from the digestive tract into the liver (known as portal vein thrombosis) causes increased pressure in these veins. Increased blood pressure in the veins supplying blood to the liver is also common in serious liver disease. The increased pressure can make the veins in the oesophagus (the tube running from the throat to the stomach) swollen and enlarged. Bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus is a life‐threatening condition. 
How are enlarged veins in the oesophagus treated?In adults, studies have shown two treatments work well to treat bleeding from enlarged veins: 
‐ taking medicines called beta‐blockers; and‐ placing an elastic ring around the vein to cut off the blood flow through it. 
These two treatments have become the main ways to prevent bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus in adults. However, we do not know how well these treatments work in children and young people, or if they cause any unwanted effects or harms.   
Why we did this Cochrane ReviewWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of placing an elastic ring around an enlarged vein to prevent it from bleeding, in children with long‐lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
What we didWe searched for studies that tested the effects of placing an elastic ring around an enlarged vein in the oesophagus to prevent it from bleeding, compared with a sham treatment (the same procedure, but no band was placed) or no treatment, in children with long‐lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
We looked for randomised clinical studies, in which the people taking part are randomly placed into different intervention groups. This type of study, if performed correctly, usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out about:
‐ how many children died;
‐ how many children had serious unwanted effects (effects considered life‐threatening or that needed hospital treatment) or liver‐related diseases; 
‐ the children's well‐being (quality of life);
‐ how many children had oesophageal bleeding; and
‐ how many children had any unwanted effects that were not considered serious.
How current is the evidence?The evidence in this review includes research published up to 27 April 2020. 
What we foundWe found only one report of a study that took place at three hospitals in the UK. It was a feasibility study: it looked at whether it would be possible to conduct larger and more conclusive randomised studies. A summary of the study data was published and presented at a conference. The study report was not good enough to judge the quality of the study. No information about funding was given. 
We did not find any other studies that could be included in this review, and there are no ongoing randomised studies. 
What are the main results?The study randomised 22 children with portal hypertension and enlarged veins into two groups: 
‐ one group had an elastic ring placed around the enlarged vein (12 children); and‐ one group had no active treatment (10 children). 
There was no information about the diagnosis, or age, of any of the children. The children were followed for at least six months. Two children were lost to follow‐up by one year. Only 10 children in total completed the trial study at two‐year follow‐up. 
In the group who had an elastic ring placed:
‐ one child died;‐ no children had any other serious unwanted effects;‐ one child needed a liver transplant; and ‐ one child had oesophageal bleeding. 
In the group who received no active treatment:
‐ no children died; ‐ one child had a serious unwanted effect: an immune disorder in which blood does not clot properly (idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura); ‐ no children needed a liver transplant; and‐ three children had oesophageal bleeding. 
No unwanted effects that were less serious were reported in either group. The study did not report any information about the children's well‐being (quality of life). 
ConclusionsThe insufficient and poor reporting of results from one small, randomised study, and the lack of other randomised studies, mean that we cannot draw trustworthy conclusions. We do not know how well elastic rings work to prevent bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus in children and young people, or about any unwanted effects they might cause. 
Until good‐quality randomised studies take place and measure the numbers of deaths, quality of life, failure to control bleeding, and unwanted effects, we will not know if elastic rings are a good treatment to prevent bleeding in children and young people with long‐lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.
