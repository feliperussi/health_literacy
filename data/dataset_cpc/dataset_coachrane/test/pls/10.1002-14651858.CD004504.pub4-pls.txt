Herbal medicine for low‐back pain
Review question 
We examined the evidence regarding the effect of herbal medicine on pain in people with non‐specific low‐back pain (LBP). 
Background Back pain is common and up to 35% of the population can be affected in a given month. Non‐specific LBP is defined as pain between the lowest rib and the bottom of the buttocks that is not caused by serious, underlying problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, infection, fracture, cancer, or sciatica due to a ruptured disc or other pressure on nerves. Herbal medicines taken orally or applied to the skin are being used to treat many conditions including back pain. 
Study characteristics Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence available up to August 5, 2013. Fourteen studies tested six herbal medications and included 2050 adults with non‐specific acute or chronic LBP. Two oral herbal medications, Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw) and Salix alba (white willow bark), were compared to placebo (fake or sham pills) or to rofecoxib (Vioxx®). Three topical creams, plasters, or gels, Capsicum frutescens (cayenne), Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey), and Solidago chilensis (Brazilian arnica), were compared to placebo creams or plasters and a homeopathic gel. One essential oil, lavender, was compared to no treatment. The average age of people included in the trials was 52 years and studies usually lasted three weeks. 
Key results Devil's claw, in a standardized daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may reduce pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 60 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx®. While willow bark, in a standardized daily dose of 120 mg and 240 mg of salicin reduced pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 240 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx® (a non‐steroidal, anti‐inflammatory drug). Cayenne was tested in several forms: in plaster form, it reduced pain more than placebo and about the same as the homeopathic gel Spiroflor SLR. Two other ointment‐based medications, S. officinale and S. chilensis appeared to reduce perception of pain more than placebo creams. Lavender essential oil applied by acupressure appeared effective in reducing pain and improving flexibility compared to conventional treatment. Adverse effects were reported, but appeared to be primarily confined to mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints or skin irritations. 
Quality of the evidence Most included trials were at low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence was mainly very low to moderate. A moderate grade of evidence was only found for C. frutescens. Trials only tested the effects of short term use (up to six weeks). Authors of eight of the included trials had a potential conflict of interest and four other authors did not disclose conflicts of interest. Vioxx® has been withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects, so all three substances should be compared to readily‐available pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, for relative effectiveness and safety. 
Conclusion Low to moderate quality evidence shows that four herbal medicines may reduce pain in acute and chronic LBP in the short‐term and have few side effects. There is no evidence yet that any of these substances are safe or efficacious for long‐term use. Large, well‐designed trials are needed to further test the efficacy of these interventions.
