Different ways of giving antibiotics to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
What is the best way of using antibiotics to eliminate lung infections caused by a germ called Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition where the airways often become blocked with mucus. It is associated with chest infections, which can lead to progressive breathing failure and death. A germ called Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often the cause of infection and is difficult to treat successfully, once infection has become established. 
We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for eliminating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis to see if any single treatment works best and is more cost‐effective.

Study characteristics 
We included seven trials with 744 people with cystic fibrosis of both sexes, any age and both mild and more severe lung disease. The trials lasted from 28 days to 27 months. We could not combine many results as trials used different treatments. Two trials compared tobramycin to placebo (a dummy treatment). Three trials combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin in the experimental group but used different comparators ‐ one compared the antibiotic combination to no treatment, one to inhaled tobramycin and the third to oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled tobramycin. Another trial considered inhaled tobramycin and compared 28 days of treatment to 56 days. The final trial compared regular cycles of inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to only treating with inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) based on the results of cultures grown in the laboratory.
