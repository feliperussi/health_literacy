Intravenous fluids for preventing prolonged labour in women giving birth to their first baby 
Labour may be considered to be a period of prolonged exercise. Labouring women may become dehydrated as a result of the physical exertion caused by the muscles of the womb contracting. In many institutions women are subjected to a questionable policy of restricted oral intake. Only sips of water or ice chips are allowed. In institutions where this is employed, women are given routine intravenous fluids (through a "drip").The aim of this review was to evaluate the impact of the routine administration of intravenous fluids (using a 'drip') on the duration of labour in women who were in their first pregnancy. We also wanted to determine any side‐effects of intravenous fluids on the mother and the newborn. 
We included nine randomised controlled trials.The review demonstrated that in women who are not freely drinking fluids during the course of their labour, additional fluids through a 'drip' (intravenously) reduces the duration of their labour. The number of caesarean sections was also reduced when women received normal saline or Ringer’s lactate at a rate of 250 mL/hour compared to 125 mL/hour. Dextrose‐containing fluids reduced the sodium levels (hyponatraemia) of both the labouring mother and their newborns. 
However, the differences in the methodology and quality of several of the trials do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend routinely attaching labouring women to a drip. Further research needs to be undertaken as to whether or not women who are freely drinking, even need to have a drip, and the policy of restricted oral intake needs to be urgently reviewed.
