Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy
Asthma is the most common disorder of the respiratory system (the organs that help you breathe) in pregnancy, affecting up to one in eight women. During pregnancy asthma can improve, worsen or remain unchanged. Poorly controlled asthma may lead to complications for mothers including pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine), gestational diabetes (high blood glucose) and caesarean birth; complications for babies may include death, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and being born low birthweight. Maintaining adequate control of asthma during pregnancy, including effective management and prevention of exacerbations, is the goal of management. In pregnancy, women may be concerned about risks of taking medications, and their health professionals may be uncertain about best management strategies. 
This review aimed to assess how effective and safe different interventions are for managing asthma during pregnancy. We were able to include eight randomised controlled trials involving 1181 women and their babies. The trials were of moderate quality overall. Five trials assessed medications. Inhaled magnesium sulphate helped to reduce further exacerbations for women with acute asthma, and helped to improve their lung function (one trial of unclear quality, 60 women). For ongoing therapy for pregnant women with stable asthma, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on asthma exacerbations was not clear (two trials, 155 women; but data only analysed from one trial, 60 women); no difference was seen in the chance of exacerbations when inhaled corticosteroids were compared with oral theophylline, however more women receiving theophylline stopped treatment because of side effects (one trial, 385 women). Three trials assessed non‐drug interventions. Adjusting women's asthma medications according to how much nitric oxide they exhaled (their fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)) was shown to reduce exacerbations and improve their quality of life (one trial, 220 women). Progressive muscle relaxation improved women's lung function and quality of life (one trial, 64 women), and asthma management led by a pharmacist helped to improve asthma control (one trial, 60 women). 
Overall, we did not find enough evidence of benefits and harms from the randomised trials to be sure about the best way to manage asthma in pregnancy, although some interventions were promising. We need larger, high‐quality trials, which should report on important health outcomes for mothers and babies, including longer‐term outcomes for babies into childhood and adulthood. Five trials are currently being planned or are underway assessing interventions for asthma in pregnancy.
