Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for women with breast cancer
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) benefits women with breast cancer. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 14 studies, most of which included women with early breast cancer. 
Key messages 
The women's health was monitored at different time points: straight after completing MBSR, up to six months after completing MBSR and up to two years after MBSR. 
MBSR may slightly improve quality of life at the end of the intervention but result in little to no difference in women's overall well‐being (quality of life) later on. MBSR probably reduces anxiety and depression, and probably improves quality of sleep at both the end of MBSR and up to six months later. Women reported being less tired just after completing MBSR but not up to 6 months later. There was no information available on survival or adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
Women with breast cancer mostly experience diagnosis and treatment as a severe and life‐threatening situation that may drastically affect their quality of life, causing symptoms such as sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Previous research shows that MBSR seems to benefit patients with lung cancer, mood disorders or chronic pain, so it may also benefit women with breast cancer. 
MBSR is an eight‐week programme that aims to reduce stress by developing mindfulness, meaning that one practises moment‐by‐moment awareness in a non‐judgmental and accepting way. We wanted to study whether MBSR benefits women with breast cancer with regard to quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue and quality of sleep. We also looked at its influence on survival and adverse events related to cancer therapy.
