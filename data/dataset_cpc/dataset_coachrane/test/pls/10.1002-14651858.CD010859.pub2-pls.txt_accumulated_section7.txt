Single therapy laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular oedema
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if laser photocoagulation is helpful for treatment of diabetic macular oedema. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 24 studies. 
Key messages The review showed that laser photocoagulation could reduce the chance of vision loss. Newer (lighter) types of laser photocoagulation may also work better than standard laser. Studies of these newer types of laser are ongoing. 
What was studied in the review? Diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar is too high. Some people with diabetes may develop problems with their eyes due to diabetic retinopathy. This is because diabetes affects the small blood vessels at the back of the eye (retina). People with diabetic retinopathy can develop swelling in the central part of the back of eye: this is known as diabetic macular oedema. It is important to treat diabetic macular oedema because it can lead to vision loss. 
Eye doctors can treat the back of the eye with small laser burns with the aim of reducing the chance of vision loss from diabetic macular oedema. This is known as laser photocoagulation. In newer types of laser photocoagulation, known as subthreshold, the laser burns are applied using less energy and potentially cause less damage. Different types of laser can be used. The main types of laser are argon or diode laser. 
What are the main results of the review? Cochrane researchers found 24 relevant studies. Nine of these studies were from Europe, seven from the USA and four from Asia. The rest were from Africa, Australia, South America, and one study took place in Europe and Asia. Some of these studies compared laser photocoagulation with no photocoagulation for people with diabetic macular oedema. Other studies compared different intensity of laser, for example, comparing subthreshold laser with standard laser. Other studies compared different types of laser (mainly argon and diode). 
Cochrane researchers assessed how certain the evidence was for each review finding. They looked for factors that could make the evidence less certain, such as problems with the way the studies were done, very small studies and inconsistent findings across studies. They also looked for factors that could make the evidence more certain, including very large effects. They graded each finding as very low‐, low‐, moderate‐ or high‐certainty.
