Use of antibiotics to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease 
What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with advanced liver disease (liver cirrhosis, or late‐stage scarring of the liver with complications) are at risk of developing an abnormal build‐up of fluid in the tummy, called ascites. This fluid may get infected with bacteria, without one knowing the cause. This is called 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'. It is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it, because it is associated with a significant risk of death. Antibiotics are often used in people with advanced liver disease and ascites as a means to help prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but it is unclear whether they are effective and if effective, which antibiotic is the most effective. 
We aimed to determine the best available antibiotic treatment (if any) for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease. We collected and analysed all relevant research studies and found 29 randomised clinical trials (participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane techniques, allowing direct comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques, allowing indirect comparisons of more than two treatments simultaneously (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis'). The aim was to gather reliable direct and indirect evidence.

Key messages 
Only two small studies were conducted without flaws, and because of the very high uncertainty in the obtained analysis results, the authors could not say whether antibiotics work and, if they work, which one to use. Out of 1564 participants, 10% of people with cirrhosis and ascites developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and out of 2169 participants, about 15% died within 12 months. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Drug companies funded five studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining six studies. 
What did the review study? 
We studied adults with advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who were undergoing preventive treatment to avoid developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Participants received different antibiotics or no antibiotics. We excluded studies in people who had previously undergone liver transplantation, and where people received antibiotics for the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or for any other reason. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 42 to 63 years. The administered antibiotic types were quinolones, rifamycins, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides. The authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious side effects, time to liver transplantation, time to development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, time to development of other complications of advanced liver disease, and length of hospital stay. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 29 studies included a small number of participants (3896 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 2587 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. The review shows that: 
‐ of the 10 different antibiotics compared in the trials, norfloxacin and rifaximin were most commonly used; ‐ 15 of every 100 people died within 12 months, and 10 of every 100 people developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; ‐ giving preventive antibiotics may make no difference to the percentage of deaths or people with serious complications; however, potentially important differences cannot be ruled out; ‐ none of the trials reported quality of life or symptomatic development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; ‐ there was evidence showing that the percentage of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as per laboratory criteria may be reduced with sulfonamides compared with no use of antibiotics (difficult to estimate how much reduction); ‐ there was evidence of differences in other outcomes such as any complications, liver transplantation, and other signs of liver failure, but these differences were not consistent. Therefore, the results are unreliable, and we cannot draw any conclusions about how effective antibiotics are; ‐ future well‐designed trials are needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We cannot draw any conclusions from these trials due to the sparse data.
