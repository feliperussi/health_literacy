Mechanical traction for neck pain with or without symptoms that radiate to the neck or arm 
Twenty‚Äêsix to 71% of the adult population can recall experiencing an episode of neck pain or stiffness in their lifetime. Neck pain is more common in females than in males, with rates reported as high as 77.8%. The natural history is unclear. Neck pain has a costly impact on society because of visits to healthcare providers, sick leave, disability and loss of productivity. There are a number of treatments available for neck pain, one of which is mechanical traction. 
Mechanical traction 'stretches' the neck. With the patient lying on their back, a head halter is placed under the back of the head and possibly the jaw and attached to a machine. The machine is set for a certain time period and specific weight for the pulling action to occur. The traction can remain on steadily for the specified time (referred to as continuous or static) or intermittently (on/off cycle) during the treatment session. Experts think that traction expands the space between the vertebrae, increases the movement of the joints and stretches the muscles and ligaments around the vertebrae. Side effects are generally few, but can include headache, nausea, fainting and injury to tissue. 
We included seven randomized controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 958 participants, that looked at the effects of continuous or intermittent mechanical traction for individuals with chronic neck pain (lasting for more than three months). Some had symptoms that radiated into the arms and head (radicular symptoms), others did not.
