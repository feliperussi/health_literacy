Using mobile phones to keep track of medicines and notify superiors when more are needed 
What is the aim of this review? 
In this Cochrane Review, we aimed to assess if health workers would have better access to medicines and other supplies, if they used mobile phones or other mobile devices to keep track of the amount of supplies they had available, and to notify superiors when they needed more supplies. We also described how health workers are currently using these mobile systems, and what factors influence their use. 
Key messages 
We do not know if using mobile phones to keep track of medical supplies gives primary healthcare workers better access to these supplies. This is because the certainty of the available evidence was very low. However, the evidence does point to several factors that could influence the implementation of these systems. These include the sharing of data across all levels of the health system; reliable access to electricity and the internet; easy‐to‐use and functional phones and systems; good technical support; and sufficient training and supervision. Well‐functioning digital systems will only succeed if medical supplies are actually available. 
What was studied in the review? 
Healthcare workers need medicines, vaccines, syringes, and other supplies to do their jobs properly. But many healthcare settings, particularly in poor countries, often lack supplies because governments cannot afford to buy them, or because they do not have good systems for distributing them to the right places at the right time. 
To address some of these problems, managers and health workers can use mobile phones to keep track of supplies, decide how much more to order and when, and let people at higher levels of the system know when supplies are running low. 
The main aim of our review was to find out if health workers who use these mobile systems had better access to supplies than health workers using other systems, or no systems at all. We also looked at how these mobile systems are being used in primary healthcare settings, and the factors that influences their use. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found one study from Malawi that measured the effect of mobile phone systems on access to medicines and supplies in health facilities. However, we do not know whether these systems improve access or not, because the certainty of this evidence was very low.
