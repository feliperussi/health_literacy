Mechanical methods for induction of labour
We set out to determine from randomised controlled trials the effectiveness and safety of mechanical methods to bring on labour in the third trimester of pregnancy (> 24 weeks' gestation). Use of a balloon to stretch the cervix (the lower end of the uterus) was compared with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), low‚Äêdose misoprostol or oxytocin. 
What is the issue? 
Induction is carried out generally when the risk of continuing pregnancy outweighs the benefits, or at the request of pregnant women. 
Mechanical methods for induction promote cervical ripening and onset of labour by stretching the cervix. They are amongst the oldest methods used to initiate labour. During the last decades, medication such as PGE2, misoprostol and oxytocin have partly replaced mechanical methods. 
Why is this important? 
More and more women have labour induced and indications are often not urgent. This means that the safety aspects of induction methods become more important, although this could be at the expense of effectiveness. Mechanical methods could have advantages over pharmacological methods as they are widely available, low in cost and may have fewer side effects, such as excessive contractions of the uterus (uterine hyperstimulation). This could potentially be safer for the baby because if contractions are too long or very close together, the baby may not receive sufficient oxygen. 
What evidence did we find? 
For this review we included a total of 113 randomised controlled trials involving 22,373 women who were scheduled for induction of labour for different indications. The data contributed to 21 different comparisons and 20 subgroup comparisons. Overall, the evidence was graded from very low to moderate quality. For many comparisons there were too few women in the trials to determine any clear differences in serious illness for mothers and babies.
