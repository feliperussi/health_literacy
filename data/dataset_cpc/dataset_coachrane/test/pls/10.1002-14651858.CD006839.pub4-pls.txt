Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)?
Background 
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection. 
Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods:
• simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants); 
• medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants);
• anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants); 
• keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves).
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises. 
Researchers found no evidence that corticosteroid injection was effective in improving symptoms of UNE. 
We were able to combine results from three trials comparing two surgical techniques: simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve (subcutaneous or submuscular). We found no important difference in symptom scores between the techniques at 6 to 12 months. Decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. Trialists found no clinical differences between surgical techniques in the other surgical trials. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma (an abnormal collection of blood) after surgery. 
Evidence was insufficient for us to choose the best treatment for UNE. However, we did find that in mild cases, information on movements and positions to avoid may reduce discomfort. Moreover, the combined results from three surgical trials provided moderate‐quality evidence that simple decompression surgery and decompression with transposition may be equally effective, but that decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. 
The evidence is up to date to 31 May 2016.
