Couples who experience difficulty conceiving are commonly referred for assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a way to achieve pregnancy. Over 3.5 million babies have been born worldwide from IVF and ICSI procedures. One of the main focuses of research in reproductive medicine is to optimise the treatment success of IVF and ICSI procedures. One such area has focused on improving the in vitro environment to which human embryos are exposed before implantation into the uterus. An important component of this in vitro environment is the oxygen concentration. Traditionally, embryos have been cultured under atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%), probably because culturing at lower oxygen concentration requires additional expenses. More recently there has been a shift towards the use of lower oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) as these more closely resemble the oxygen concentration under natural conditions (2% to 8%). The results of clinical studies that have been undertaken to study the effect on the outcomes of IVF and ICSI procedures of culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations have been conflicting. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the literature to find the best available evidence. It has shown that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations does indeed improve clinical outcomes after IVF and ICSI, such as number of deliveries (live birth rate) and ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. Furthermore, no evidence was found of an increased risk of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and congenital abnormalities. We concluded that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations seems beneficial with an increase in the number of newborns, but more studies are needed to strongly prove this effect.
