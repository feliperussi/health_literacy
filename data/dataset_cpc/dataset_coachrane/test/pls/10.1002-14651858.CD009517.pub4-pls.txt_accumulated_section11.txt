Endometrial injury in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
Review question 
To assess whether it is safe and effective to perform endometrial injury (also known as endometrial scratching), in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and frozen embryo transfer. 
Background 
Couples who have trouble getting pregnant may seek fertility treatments to help them conceive, such as IVF. In an IVF cycle, eggs are collected from the woman and are combined with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. Embryos are transferred into the womb in the hope that they will implant and establish a pregnancy. Implantation is the process by which an embryo embeds itself into the lining of the womb; it is the first step toward establishing a successful pregnancy. It has been suggested that the chances of implantation are increased if endometrial injury is performed before replacement of the embryo into the womb. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 clinical trials (8915 women) which had tested the effects of endometrial injury on the outcomes of IVF. The studies were conducted in different populations of women, and the way the endometrial injury was conducted also differed between studies in terms of the instrument used and the timing of the procedure in relation to the IVF cycle. Many of the studies were poor quality and at high risk of bias, and therefore we performed the main analyses only including studies that were not at high risk of bias. Of the 38 included studies, only eight were included in the primary analyses. 
Key results 
It is unclear whether endometrial injury affects the chance having a baby from IVF. The results suggest that, if the chance of having a baby from IVF is usually about 27%, then the chance of having a baby when using endometrial injury before IVF would be somewhere between less than 27% and 32%. Similarly, for the outcome of pregnancy, if the chance of getting pregnant from IVF is assumed to be about 32%, then the chance of pregnancy when using endometrial injury before IVF is somewhere between 31% and 37%. 
Endometrial injury does not appear to affect the chance of having a miscarriage from IVF. The endometrial injury procedure causes mild to moderate pain and a small amount of vaginal bleeding, although this is short‐lived. This evidence does not support the routine use of endometrial injury for women undergoing IVF. 
One small study compared endometrial injury using two different instruments in the cycle prior to the IVF cycle. All outcomes reported for this study were graded as very‐low certainty due to risk of bias, and as such we were not able to interpret the study results.
