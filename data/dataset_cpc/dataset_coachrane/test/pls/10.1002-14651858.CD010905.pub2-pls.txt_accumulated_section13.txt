Effects of training supervisors on employees' stress, absenteeism, and well‐being
Background 
Supervisors are assumed to play a crucial role in creating the working conditions of their employees and thus promoting their health and well‐being. Training programmes are widely used to improve supervisors' skills in improving health and well‐being of their employees. 
Review question 
We examined the effects of four types of training for supervisors on employees' stress, absenteeism, and mental well‐being. We assessed the effects of training aiming to improve interaction between supervisors and employees, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job.We also assessed training aimed at improving supervisors' capabilities to design the work environment, either off‐the‐job or on‐the‐job. 
Study characteristics 
We included 25 studies of which 4 studies are awaiting assessment. The 21 studies that could be analysed included a total of 3479 employees. Sixteen studies trained supervisor‐employee interaction, either off‐the‐job (9 studies) or on‐the job (7 studies). Five studies trained the design of working environments, off‐the‐job in 2 studies and on‐the job in 3 studies. The 21 studies compared 23 interventions with no training, sham training or other training at various times of follow‐up. 
Key results 
There is no considerable effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (6 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to no training. There is inconsistent evidence that supervisor training may (2 studies) or may not (7 studies) improve employees' well‐being when compared to no training. Data were missing from two studies, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well‐being. 
There is no effect of supervisor training on employees' stress (2 studies) or absenteeism (1 study) when compared to a placebo training. Data were missing from one study, so we could not calculate the effects of training on employee well‐being. 
One study that evaluated supervisor training compared to another type of training to reduce employees' stress did not provide enough data to calculate its effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low for most outcomes due to risk of bias in the studies, inconsistent results, and imprecise effects. Researchers should consider the shortcomings of studies included in this review in order to conduct well‐designed studies in the future and report them appropriately.
