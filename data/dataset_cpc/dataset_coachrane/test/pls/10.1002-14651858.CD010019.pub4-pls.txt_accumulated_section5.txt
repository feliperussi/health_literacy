Is home or hospital treatment better for people with blood clots in the lungs?
Key message 
We are uncertain if treatment in hospital or at home (outpatient) is better for some people with blood clots in the lungs. We did not find clear evidence of an important difference in the number of deaths, bleeding, recurrence of new blood clots, or patient satisfaction, because the results were imprecise and the studies did not report side effects on blood pressure or information on how well people followed medical advice. More well‐designed studies are needed before doctors can make informed practice decisions. 
Why is this question important? 
A blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) is a major cause of death and illness. These can occur after a blood clot breaks off from somewhere else in the body and travels in the blood to the lungs. The clot can often travel from the leg, where it is called a deep vein thrombosis. How people are treated depends on whether they are low‐risk or high‐risk, but most people are given blood‐thinning drugs (anticoagulants) in hospital. For some low‐risk cases with sudden onset (acute) pulmonary embolism, treatment at home might be better than keeping them in hospital. Possible benefits include fewer people in hospital, less risk of picking up an infection in hospital, cost savings, and better health‐related quality of life. We wanted to know if there were any differences in risks and benefits between people with blood clots in the lungs who are treated at home compared to those treated in the hospital.
