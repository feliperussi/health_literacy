Light therapy for prevention of winter depression
Why is this review important? 
Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has relatives and friends who have experienced winter depression. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning light therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms could help to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review was to find out whether light therapy can prevent the onset of depression in winter when it is used in healthy people with a history of winter depression, and if it is safe. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way, but it is of importance for those who have suffered winter depression. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on light therapy to prevent winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received light therapy or no treatment. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression.
