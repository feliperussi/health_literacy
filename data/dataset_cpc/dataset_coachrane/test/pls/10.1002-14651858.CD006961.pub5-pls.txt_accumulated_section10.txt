Testing antibiotics in combination for acute infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We compared the evidence for the effect of testing antibiotics traditionally (one at a time) compared to testing a combination of antibiotics for acute airway infections in people with long‐term (chronic) infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Background 
The main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis is chronic lung infection. People with cystic fibrosis now live longer due to the aggressive use of antibiotics to treat lung infections. Traditionally, antibiotics are chosen based on the results of laboratory testing of each antibiotic separately against the bacterium (or bug) that is found in the lungs of the person with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotics tested in combination may work effectively against a bacterium even if not effective when tested alone. However, when choosing antibiotics to treat lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis, it is unclear whether basing the choice of antibiotics on the results of combination testing is better than basing choice on the results of testing antibiotics separately. 
This is an updated version of a previously published review.

Study characteristics 
The search identified one study that tried to answer this question and was eligible for inclusion in the review. The study enrolled 132 people with cystic fibrosis, most of whom (82 people) had acute lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and randomly put them into two treatment groups. In the first group two antibiotics were selected following the testing of combinations of antibiotics and in the second group the two antibiotics were chosen after testing individual antibiotics to see how effective the drugs were against the bacterium. The study was run across several centres and assessed the clinical outcomes in the participants after a 14‐day course of treatment.
