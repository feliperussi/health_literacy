Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for low back pain with sciatica
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among people with sciatica on pain reduction, overall improvement and side effects. NSAIDs were compared to placebo, other NSAIDs, or other drugs. 
Background 
NSAIDs are the most frequently prescribed medication worldwide and are commonly used to treat low back pain with or without pain radiating to the leg (sciatica). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for both published and unpublished trials up to 24 June 2015. We included 10 trials (reported in 9 publications) with 1651 participants that compared NSAIDs with placebo or other drugs. Participants in the trials were 16 to 75 years of age and reported sciatica. The trials followed the participants for a short time, up to three weeks. 
Key results 
NSAIDs are no more effective in reducing pain in sciatica than placebo or other drugs. NSAIDs are more effective in overall improvement compared to placebo or other drugs, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as the methodological quality of included trials is low. There is an increased risk of side effects when using NSAIDs compared to placebo. In light of the potentially serious adverse effects associated with NSAIDs, and as this drug is frequently prescribed, high‐quality trials in different patient populations are warranted to address the short‐ and long‐term benefits and long‐term risks of NSAIDs. 
Quality of the results 
The quality of the evidence in this review ranged from very low to low that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo, therefore the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.
