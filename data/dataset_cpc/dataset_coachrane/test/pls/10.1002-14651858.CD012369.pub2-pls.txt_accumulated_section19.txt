Aspirin and similar drugs for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Key messages 
‐ When used after standard initial treatment with anticoagulants, aspirin and similar drugs (antiplatelet agents) in addition to best medical practice (BMP), may reduce recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), i.e. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), when compared to BMP plus placebo in a chronic DVT setting. There is no clear difference in side effects, major bleeding or PE with the use of antiplatelet agents. 
‐ Studies of high methodological quality that are large and long enough to detect significant clinical outcomes are needed to assess the long‐term effect of antiplatelet agents. Studies should include people with acute and chronic DVT and include information about important outcomes such as DVT, PE and major bleeding, the use of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and the age of the participants. 
What is DVT? 
DVT is a blood clot formed inside the venous system of the body, blocking the flow of blood. 
How is DVT treated? 
After initial treatment with anticoagulants, people receive follow‐up treatment (known as BMP) which include drugs for preventing new clots, compression stockings and clinical care (such as physical exercise and skin hydration). Antiplatelets such as aspirin, are medicines that stop cells in the blood (platelets) from sticking together and forming a clot. They could therefore be seen as a potential additional intervention to the current BMP for treating DVT. Antiplatelets could be used to minimise complications such as post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS, a situation in which a blood clot in the vein causes impaired function in the affected vessels), and PE (when the blood clot travels through the bloodstream to the lung and blocks its flow). Antiplatelets may also reduce the recurrence of DVT or PE. One drawback of the use of antiplatelets is the potential for an increase in bleeding. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving antiplatelets to people to treat DVT, following initial treatment, reduced the number of recurrent VTEs, bleeding or PE compared to people who received only BMP or BMP plus placebo (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no medical effect). We also wanted to determine whether antiplatelets reduced death, whether people developed PTS, whether they experienced side effects, whether their quality of life improved and whether there was a change in the length of time spent in hospital. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed antiplatelets given to people to treat DVT. Studies should have a randomised design (when participants are randomly allocated to treatment groups) as long as they compared an antiplatelet plus BMP with BMP alone or BMP with placebo. These treatments were started after initial standard anticoagulation for DVT. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
The results are based on six studies with 1625 participants from the USA, Canada, Europe, India, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. Two large groups of participants were studied: participants with acute DVT (treatment started up to 21 days after symptoms), and participants with chronic DVT (treatment started after 21 days of symptoms). All studies used BMP as a comparison, or BMP plus placebo. Each comparison investigated the effects of antiplatelets on the recurrence of DVT, PE, death and side effects. 
We have limited confidence that antiplatelets in addition to BMP may have an effect on reducing the risk of a new episode of VTE when compared to BMP with placebo in a chronic DVT setting. It is necessary to treat 14 patients to avoid one VTE event. When only PE was studied, however, antiplatelets did not achieve a difference between the groups. The use of antiplatelets as an additional treatment does not appear to add any harm or risks, such as death, bleeding, or other side effects. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive antiplatelets may have lower rates of recurrent VTE compared to those who did not receive antiplatelets in a chronic DVT setting. Similarly, although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive antiplatelets may have a lower rate of PTS and increased side effects in an acute DVT setting. 
We can draw no conclusions from the very limited available evidence for using antiplatelets as an additional treatment to BMP compared with BMP alone in acute and chronic DVT settings. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence was limited or very limited because few people experienced the outcomes, and some studies' limitations could introduce errors, for example randomisation and selective reporting concerns, poorly‐defined outcomes and duplicate publication.
