Laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm
Background 
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal widening of the abdominal aorta, the main artery supplying blood to the organs in the abdomen and lower part of the body. Between 4% and 7% of men over 65 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture which can lead to death; approximately 60% of people with a ruptured AAA die before reaching hospital. People with AAAs over 55 mm are generally referred for repair, as the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. There are three methods of repairing an AAA: surgery, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and laparoscopic repair. Surgery involves making a large cut in the abdomen, after which the abdominal aorta is exposed and opened and a synthetic graft (tube) is sewn in place to replace the weakened area of the aorta. EVAR involves making a cut in the groin area, after which a stent graft is inserted in collapsed form and opened inside the aneurysm under x‐ray guidance and held in place with a stent. Laparoscopic repair or 'keyhole' AAA surgery is carried out by making very small cuts in the patient’s abdomen, after which a fine telescope (a laparoscope) is inserted through these cuts and the synthetic graft is sewn in place. The benefits of EVAR and laparoscopic repair are that they require smaller incisions, are less painful, have fewer complications, a lower mortality rate and shorter hospital stay than surgical repair. Current evidence suggests that EVAR is the preferred approach for AAA repair. However laparoscopic AAA repair has been suggested as a safe and effective alternative in treating those patients for whom EVAR is unsuitable. This review aimed to assess the effects of laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms.
