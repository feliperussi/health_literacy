Paracetamol for treating people with hip or knee osteoarthritis
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is.

Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks)
