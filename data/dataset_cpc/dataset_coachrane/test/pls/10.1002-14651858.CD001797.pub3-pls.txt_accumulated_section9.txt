Intravenous immunoglobulin for people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
Review question 
We performed this review to assess the evidence from randomised trials on how effective and safe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is for people with CIDP. 
Background 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an illness in which nerves become inflamed and this leads to paralysis. The likely cause is that the body attacks its own nerves. CIDP usually requires long‐term treatment to prevent further disability. There is much debate about the first choice of treatment. One choice is a medicine called immunoglobulin, which is a product made from purified antibodies from human donor blood and which is given via injection into a vein. Steroid drugs and plasma exchange (a treatment in which the plasma element of a person's blood is replaced), are known to be effective. 
Study characteristics 
Eight randomised controlled trials including 332 participants with CIDP were eligible for this review. These compared IVIg with placebo (dummy treatment), plasma exchange, or steroid drugs. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
We found five randomised trials which together prove that IVIg improves disability more than placebo (dummy treatment). The results showed that three people would need to be treated for one person to improve. In the three trials that compared IVIg with other treatments, results with IVIg were similar to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone. The evidence was of moderate or high quality. In this review, there were mild and short‐term side effects in around half of those who received IVIg. Six per cent of those treated with IVIg had serious side effects, which is a similar rate as with plasma exchange or corticosteroids.
