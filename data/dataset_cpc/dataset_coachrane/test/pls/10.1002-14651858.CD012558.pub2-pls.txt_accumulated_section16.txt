Why is improving dementia diagnosis important?
Dementia refers to a group of brain conditions that lead to progressive problems with memory, working‐things‐out, or functioning in everyday life. Doctors use a variety of tests to diagnose dementia. People have often reported that it can take a long time to get a diagnosis of dementia from initially presenting to a healthcare provider with symptoms suggestive of dementia. 
Cognitive impairment is a broader term that includes people whose brain is not functioning as well as expected given their age, but they do not have dementia, as well as people with dementia. Some people with cognitive impairment who do not have dementia may have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Some people with MCI (but not all) will develop dementia over time. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The review authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgement of general practitioners (GPs) for diagnosing dementia, and cognitive impairment, in primary care. 
What was studied in the review? 
The authors included extracted data from 11 studies, including 10 with complete data on diagnostic accuracy. The authors included eight studies in the statistical summary with a total of 2790 people, of whom 826 (30%) had dementia. The authors included four studies that investigated cognitive impairment as the condition to diagnose, with a total of 1497 people of whom 594 had cognitive impairment (40%). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The results of the review indicate that in theory, if GPs used their clinical judgement in practice for dementia, they would correctly identify 58% of the people who have dementia as having the condition (sensitivity) and 89% of the people who do not have dementia as being free of the condition (specificity). 
The results of the review indicate that in theory, if GPs used their clinical judgement in practice for cognitive impairment, they would correctly identify 84% of the people who have cognitive impairment as having the condition (sensitivity) and 73% of the people who do not have cognitive impairment as being free of the condition (specificity). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In this review there were some technical problems with the design of the original studies, and there were differences between studies that made it difficult to compare them to each other. This means that it is difficult to be certain how applicable these findings are in clinical practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Researchers who conducted the studies in the review carried out their investigations mostly in Europe, with one study in the USA and one study in Australia. All studies included people attending their GP. Average age ranged from 73 years to 83 years (weighted average 77 years). The percentage of female participants in studies ranged from 47% to 100%. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of dementia was between 2% and 56% across studies (a weighted average of 21%). If applying these findings in settings with fewer number of people with dementia then the accuracy of the test may be different. 
What are the implications of this review? 
If these studies are indeed representative of GPs practice, then if GPs used their clinical judgement alone to diagnose dementia then this might mean that some people with dementia are incorrectly 'missed', and it is important to do further tests to confirm that the person does not have a problem. However, if a GP thinks someone has dementia there is a good chance that the diagnosis is correct and the test to confirm dementia might be different and potentially less time consuming and burdensome. The studies included in this review suggest that clinical judgement could be a useful test to determine what to do next.
