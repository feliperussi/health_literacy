Inositol in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome
Review question Does the administration of supplementary inositol reduce adverse outcomes in preterm infants with or without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)? 
Background Inositol is an essential nutrient for cells, with high concentrations in breast milk (particularly in the breast milk of mothers whose babies have been born early). A drop in inositol levels in babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) can be a sign that their illness will be severe. Inositol is thought to be an important nutrient in development before and after birth.

Study characteristics Six published randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 1177 infants enrolled. This update includes the results from two high‐quality studies conducted in 760 infants of less than 30 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). 
Key results In our previous update of our review, in 2015, we found that the initial evidence regarding inositol supplementation in preterm babies with RDS was promising. Inositol supplementation lowered rates of death and bleeding in the brain, with an important reduction in eye problems as well. Inositol did not have serious adverse effects. We suggested that further research was warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. Such research has now been published from two high‐quality studies that included 760 infants of less than 30 weeks' PMA, the most vulnerable population. All results indicate that there are no reductions in adverse outcomes associated with inositol supplementation, including infant death, eye problems, bleeding in the brain, infections, chronic lung problems and gastrointestinal problems. Thus inositol supplementation in preterm infants is not recommended. Infants enrolled in these studies should be followed into childhood for assessment of any neuro‐developmental problems. 
Quality of evidence According to GRADE (a method to score the quality of the trials supporting each outcome), the quality of the evidence varied but was moderate to high for the important outcomes in the analyses for repeated high doses of inositol in infants born at less than 30 weeks' postmenstrual age.
