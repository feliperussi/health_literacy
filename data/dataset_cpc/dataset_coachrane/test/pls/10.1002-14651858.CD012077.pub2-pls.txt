Interventions during pregnancy and childbirth for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of Cochrane reviews 
What is the issue? 
Cerebral palsy is a term that includes a group of conditions affecting people's ability to move, and is the most common physical disability in childhood. Cerebral palsy is usually due to events before, during, or after childbirth that lead to injury in babies' developing brains. There is no single cause of cerebral palsy. For many children, the cause of cerebral palsy is unclear, however, there are many known risk factors. The biggest risk factor is birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm birth). Other risk factors for mothers include some medical conditions (including thyroid problems), abnormalities of the placenta, pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine), and some bacterial and viral infections. For babies, risk factors include congenital and genetic abnormalities, having a low birthweight or growth restricted as a fetus, being a twin or triplet, some infections, and prolonged loss of oxygen during birth. 
Why is this important? 
As there are different risk factors and causes for cerebral palsy, it is likely that various different interventions (treatments) may be needed to prevent cerebral palsy by reducing risk factors. This overview summarises the evidence about preventing cerebral palsy from Cochrane reviews of interventions during pregnancy and childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 7 August 2016. We identified 15 Cochrane reviews that assessed interventions during pregnancy or childbirth that reported on cerebral palsy, with information from 27 randomised controlled trials involving 32,490 children. The reviews were all high quality, but the quality of the evidence about cerebral palsy ranged from very low to high. 
The interventions assessed were for treating mild to moderate hypertension (two reviews), treating pre‐eclampsia (two reviews), diagnosing or preventing fetal compromise (when the unborn baby may not be well) during labour (one review), preventing preterm birth (four reviews), maturing or protecting babies' lungs or brains before preterm birth (five reviews), and managing fetal compromise of preterm babies (one review). 
We found high‐quality evidence that one intervention was effective for cerebral palsy prevention: preterm children born to mothers who received magnesium sulphate before birth were less likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers received a placebo (five trials, 6145 children). 
We found moderate‐quality evidence that two interventions were probably ineffective, and could cause harm: (i) children born to mothers who had received antibiotics for preterm labour when their waters had not broken were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than children whose mothers did not receive antibiotics (one trial, 3173 children); and (ii) preterm children who were born immediately when there was suspected fetal compromise were more likely to develop cerebral palsy than those for whom birth was postponed (one trial, 507 children). 
We found moderate‐quality evidence that there was no clear difference in the chance of children to develop cerebral palsy whether their mothers received one or more courses of corticosteroids before preterm birth (four trials, 3800 children). 
There was low‐quality evidence as to whether the other interventions prevented, increased, or had no impact on cerebral palsy, although we did find that children born to mothers who received corticosteroids to help mature their lungs before preterm birth were potentially less likely to develop cerebral palsy than those born to mothers who received a placebo (five trials, 904 children). 
What does this mean? 
We identified one intervention that was effective in preventing cerebral palsy (magnesium sulphate before preterm birth), two that appeared to cause harm (preventive antibiotics for women in preterm labour when their waters have not broken, and immediate birth for preterm babies with suspected compromise), and one that did not appear to make a clear difference (more than one course of corticosteroids before preterm birth). For the other interventions assessed, there was not enough evidence to reach any conclusions. Further good quality randomised controlled trials, assessing interventions that might impact cerebral palsy risk factors, with long‐term follow‐up to measure cerebral palsy, are needed. We identified over 60 other Cochrane reviews that may provide more information in the future.
