How effective are initiatives that aim to speed up the diagnosis of brain tumours?
Why this question is importantA brain tumour is a group of cells in the brain that develop in an abnormal and uncontrollable way. There are two main types of brain tumour: 
‐ Non‐cancerous (benign) brain tumours: these grow slowly and do not spread throughout the body.‐ Cancerous (malignant) brain tumours: these grow faster and can spread to other parts of the body. 
Brain tumours that start in the brain are known as primary tumours. If they have spread to the brain from elsewhere, they are called secondary tumours. 
All types of brain tumour are a serious health threat, since the brain controls all the functions of the body. Both benign and cancerous brain tumours can be fatal. Even when they are not, they can be very disabling. Symptoms can include: 
‐ Headaches‐ Epileptic seizures (fits)‐ Persistent nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, and drowsiness‐ Changes in behaviour or personality, trouble thinking, memory problems‐ Weakness, or paralysis that develops on one side of the body‐ Problems with speech or vision 
It is difficult to diagnose brain tumours, because symptoms can all be mistaken for those of less serious conditions. It may take some time before their true cause – a brain tumour – is identified. Yet diagnosing a brain tumour as early as possible is important, because the bigger a tumour grows, the more difficult it is to treat, and the greater the potential for the treatment to cause collateral damage.
