Pharmacological interventions to prevent and treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding in neonates 
Review question To assess how different medications for reducing stomach acidity (proton pump inhibitors, histamine 2 receptor antagonists, antacids) or for protecting the stomach lining (sucralfate or bismuth salts) given to preterm and term infants help to prevent or treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding, reduce suffering of other illnesses and deaths. 
Background Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common in sick newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care. It may be associated with reflux of milk (gastroesophageal reflux) or allergy to milk proteins. Common symptoms include vomiting of material which can be either bloodstained or like coffee grounds in appearance; and black, tarry stools. When occurring in otherwise well newborns it is typically a mild, self‐limiting condition. However, upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be severe particularly when associated with other underlying conditions. 
Study characteristics We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The search is up to date as of 12 July 2018. 
Key results We found 11 trials with 818 infants. We considered no trial to be at low risk of bias. 
Four trials included 329 infants in neonatal intensive care units and used a histamine 2 receptor antagonist for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These four trials demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, but no change in mortality. Outcomes such as serious gastrointestinal problems (e.g. necrotising enterocolitis) and infections were not reported. 
Seven trials with 489 infants enrolled sick newborn infants with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and used either a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor for treatment. Use of a histamine 2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in a treatment context was associated with a reduction of both duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however it did not affect mortality or requirement for blood transfusion. No long‐term follow‐up was reported.
