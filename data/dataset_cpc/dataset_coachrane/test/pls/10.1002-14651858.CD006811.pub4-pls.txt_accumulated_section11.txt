Treatments to reduce body temperature to 35 ºC to 37.5 °C in people who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury occurs as a result of direct impact to the brain, such as after a road traffic accident or fall from a height. It is a major cause of death and disability, experienced by about 5.5 million people worldwide every year. Damage occurs in two stages: firstly, at the time of impact; and secondly, in the hours and weeks following injury. Management of a traumatic brain injury aims to reduce the impact of this secondary damage. There is some evidence to suggest that people with a normal body temperature after injury may have a better outcome than those with a higher temperature.  
Review question 
This review assessed whether medicines or physical cooling treatments that do not use medicine, given to reduce body temperature to between 35 °C and 37.5 °C, affect outcomes in adults or children who are in hospital after a traumatic brain injury. 
Search date 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 28 November 2019. RCTs assign participants to treatment group by chance, and provide the most reliable type of evidence. 
Study characteristics 
We found only one small study with 41 people who had recently been admitted to the intensive care unit after a traumatic head injury. This study assessed the effects of paracetamol, given intravenously (through a needle or tube inserted into a vein) for 72 hours, compared to an intravenous salt solution that was disguised to look like the paracetamol solution. 
We found no full reports of studies that gave people with traumatic brain injury other medicines or physical cooling treatments, such as blankets, fans, or ice to cool the surface of the skin, or cooled intravenous fluids. We found a short report about one very small study of a physical cooling treatment. The report did not give enough information for us to include its data, but we may include it in future if more information becomes available. 
We also found four ongoing studies, which may provide more evidence for the review once they have completed. Some studies include participants who have other types of brain injury. We will only be able to include these studies in the review if they report the findings for people with traumatic brain injury separately from people with other conditions.
