Animal‐source foods for growth and development in children 6 to 59 months of age
What is the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of animal‐source foods on the growth and development of children between 6 and 59 months of age. 
What is the rationale for studying this? 
The nutrition a child receives during the first five years of life is important for his or her growth and development. Animal‐source foods such as meat, fish, eggs, or dairy provide critical nutrients. Compared to foods such as iron‐fortified cereal products, the nutrients in animal‐source foods may be better absorbed by, and used in, the body. 
What studies were included? 
We included 6 studies with a total of 3036 children aged between 5 months and 50 months of age at enrollment. The interventions were conducted in China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, USA, and Zambia, and lasted between 5 and 12 months. 
Three studies compared animal‐source foods to a fortified (iron‐fortified or iron and zinc‐fortified) or unfortified cereal product. Two studies compared animal‐source foods to no intervention. One study compared meat to dairy. The types of animal‐source foods provided included beef, pork, eggs, yogurt, cheese, and powdered whey protein. 
Three studies were funded in part by government entities and in part by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies; we rated these studies as at unclear risk of other bias. One study was supported by a nonprofit organization. Two studies did not report a funding source.
