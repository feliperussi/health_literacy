Early or delayed surgical removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis 
Review question 
What are the risks and benefits of early versus delayed removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis? 
Background 
The human appendix is a tube at the connection of the small and the large intestines. Possible functions of the appendix may be to protect the body against infection and to maintain healthy levels bacteria in the gut when recovering from diarrhoea. Appendicitis covers a variety of clinical conditions resulting from inflammation of the appendix. 
Complicated appendicitis is defined as appendiceal phlegmon (simple inflammatory mass without pus located in bottom right of the appendix) or appendiceal abscess (pocket of pus surrounding an acutely inflamed and/or ruptured appendix). People with this condition usually need surgical removal of the appendix to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of surgical removal of the appendix is controversial. Immediate surgery is technically demanding. Some experts question the appropriateness of delayed appendectomy, as people are unlikely to experience a recurrence after a successful non‚Äêsurgical treatment. However, the true diagnosis could be uncertain in some cases, and postponing the appendectomy may delay diagnosis of underlying disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials up to 23 August 2016. We identified two trials involving 80 participants. One compared early versus delayed open appendicectomy in 40 children and adults with appendiceal phlegmon. The other trial compared early versus delayed keyhole (laparoscopic) appendicectomy (where surgery is performed through a very small incision) in 40 children with appendiceal abscess. Studies took place in the USA and India. The age of the individuals in the trials varied between 1 year and 84 years, and 27.5% were females.
