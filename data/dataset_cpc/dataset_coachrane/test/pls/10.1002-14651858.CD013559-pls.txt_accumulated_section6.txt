Intense‐pulsed light (IPL) therapy for the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction
Background: dry eye is an eye condition that can cause eye soreness or irritation and changes to vision. One of the main causes of dry eye is known as 'meibomian gland dysfunction' (MGD), which causes problems in the meibomian glands (glands located in the eyelids). These glands produce an oily substance (known as meibum). Meibum is important for keeping the tears and surface of the eye healthy. In MGD, the meibomian glands become blocked and the meibum is abnormal. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is a light treatment applied to the skin near the bottom eyelids. IPL therapy has been suggested as a treatment for MGD. 
Aim of the review: to summarise research on the use of IPL for treating MGD. We were interested in whether the treatment improved dry eye symptoms. We considered whether there were any side effects from IPL. We were also interested in several clinical tests, such as corneal sodium fluorescein staining (a test that uses orange dye (fluorescein) to detect damage to the surface of the eye). These tests give us information about whether the treatment improves the working of the meibomian glands. 
Study characteristics: we searched for studies that had been published up to 1 August 2019. We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 114 adults (228 eyes) from three countries (New Zealand, Japan and China) that had been published between 2015 and 2019. The maximum time that people in the studies were followed up for after the treatment was nine months. 
Key findings: because of very low‐quality evidence, we are unclear about the effect of IPL on dry eye symptoms. IPL may be helpful to improve some of the clinical signs of MGD (such as tear stability and tear composition ‐ both signs of how healthy the tears produced by the eye are). We are uncertain about the effect of IPL on meibomian gland blockage or corneal sodium fluorescein staining. 
As most studies did not report side effects, we are uncertain about the safety of IPL as a treatment for MGD. Very low‐quality results from individual studies suggest there may be some side effects, including mild eye pain and burning, and partially losing eyelashes (due to mistakes when using the IPL device).
