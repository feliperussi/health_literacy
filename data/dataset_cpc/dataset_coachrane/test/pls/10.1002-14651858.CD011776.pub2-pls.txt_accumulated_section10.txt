Managing symptoms in motor neuron disease
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments for managing symptoms in motor neuron disease (MND)?
Background 
Motor neuron disease (MND), which is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is an uncommon, incurable disease that affects the nerves involved in movement. MND gets worse over time and affects muscles of the limbs, speech, swallowing and breathing. People with MND experience a wide range of symptoms, including a number of physical ability limitations, pain, spasticity, cramps, swallowing problems and difficulty breathing. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to show that a treatment is effective for several reasons that are not related to the effects of the treatment itself, for example when there are too few people in a trial, or investigators choose an ineffective dose of a drug. 
Review characteristics 
We searched for Cochrane Systematic Reviews of treatments aiming to manage symptoms of MND. We found nine reviews that fitted the objectives of this study. These reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for pain, cramps, spasticity, and sialorrhoea, and assessed the effects of mechanical ventilation (non‐invasive ventilation), enteral tube feeding, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), therapeutic exercise, and multidisciplinary care. The trials compared the treatment with an inactive treatment (placebo drug or sham therapy) or usual care. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
There are currently many treatments in clinical use for pain, but no robust information currently exists on their effectiveness in people with MND. 
There is evidence that memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol are probably ineffective for cramps in ALS and that vitamin E may be ineffective. There is too little information from RCTs on the effects of other treatments studied, including L‐threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen. The review did not report adverse events other than for riluzole.
