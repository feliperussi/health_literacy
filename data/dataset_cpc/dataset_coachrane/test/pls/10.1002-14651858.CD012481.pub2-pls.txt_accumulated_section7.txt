Benefits and harms of drug‐eluting versus bare‐metal stents in people with acute coronary syndrome 
Background 
Acute coronary syndrome is a term applied to heart attacks as well as chest pain during rest. The syndrome is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart due to either a narrowing of the vessels supplying the heart or a blood clot. According to the World Health Organization, 3.7 million people died from acute coronary syndrome in 2012. Percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as coronary angioplasty, is used to treat the narrowed or blocked vessel of the heart by inflating a balloon to allow blood to flow through the vessel again. Coronary stents are then inserted into the vessel to ensure it remains open. Two types of stents are available for use, a stent that is coated with a drug intended to reduce the risk of future blockages (drug‐eluting stent) and an uncoated stent (bare‐metal stent). In this review, we aimed to assess the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents compared with bare‐metal stents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases from their inception to January 2017 and found 25 trials where people were randomly allocated to either a group receiving drug‐eluting stents or a group receiving bare‐metal stents. The 25 trials (26 comparisons) included 12,503 adults with a mean age of 60.8 years. 
Key results 
The people receiving drug‐eluting stents did seem to have a reduced risk of experiencing a serious adverse event compared with those receiving bare‐metal stents, without affecting the risk of dying from any cause or specifically heart disease, or of having a heart attack. The serious adverse event likely to be avoided by those receiving drug‐eluting stents seems to be repeat balloon angioplasty. No data were reported on quality of life or chest pain (angina) after receiving the stent.
