We did not combine the results from the studies because of differences in comparison (called control) treatments and study design. One study compared propofol with no agent. This study used polysomnography (which records brain waves, oxygen level in blood, heart rate, breathing, and eye and leg movements) to measure sleep quality and quantity. It reported no improvement in duration of sleep with propofol but participants woke up less often and for shorter lengths of time and described their sleep quality as being improved with propofol. One study compared a higher dose of propofol at night described as additional night sedation, with a constant day‐time and night‐time dose. This study used the Ramsay Sedation Scale (which is normally used by anaesthetists to assess how easily a person is roused) and reported that participants appeared to have an improved sleep rhythm. Two studies compared propofol with benzodiazepines (a tranquilizing medicine; flunitrazepam in one study and midazolam in one study). These studies used the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure quantity and quality of sleep. The study with flunitrazepam reported fewer awakenings of reduced duration with propofol but similar total sleep time in each group and the study with midazolam reported no difference in sleep quality. The study with flunitrazepam also measured sleep with Bispectral Index (used by anaesthetists to assess depth of anaesthesia) and reported longer time in deep sleep, with fewer awakenings. The study with midazolam reported higher levels of anxiety and depression in both groups, and no difference when participants were given propofol. No study reported on side effects.
