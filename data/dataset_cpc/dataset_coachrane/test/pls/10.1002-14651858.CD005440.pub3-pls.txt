Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis
The liver produces bile which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for people with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key‐hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis (inflammation) of the gallbladder is one of the indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis can occur suddenly, with symptoms such as fever along with intense pain in the right upper tummy. This is called acute cholecystitis. In comparison, chronic cholecystitis is a smouldering inflammation of the gallbladder which presents with less intense pain in the right upper tummy. For many years, surgeons have preferred to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the inflammation settles down completely (which usually takes about six weeks) because of the fear of higher complication rates including injury to the bile duct (a tube through which the bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel). Injury to the bile duct is a life‐threatening condition which requires urgent corrective operation in most instances. In spite of the corrective surgery, people have poor quality of life several years after the operation due to repeated instances of bile infection caused by obstruction to the flow of bile into the small bowel. Another reason for the surgeons' preference for delaying the operation is to avoid an open operation, as there has been a perception that early operation increases the risk of an open operation. However, delaying the surgery exposes the people to the risk of complications related to gallstones. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within seven days of people presenting to doctors with symptoms) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after the initial admission). A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information. 
Six trials providing information on the review question were identified. A total of 488 people with acute cholecystitis were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed early (within seven days of people presenting to the doctor with symptoms) in 244 people while it was performed after at least six weeks in the remaining 244 people. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias (and might have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). All the people included in the trials were discharged home alive after operation in the five trials from which this information was available. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury, surgical complications, or who required conversion from key‐hole to open operation between the two groups. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups. Only one trial reported the time taken for employed people to return to work. The people belonging to the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group returned to work 11 days, on average, earlier than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related complications during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related complications, including two people with cholangitis. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trial. Approximately one‐sixth of people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. Based on information from a varied number of participants as well as trials at high risk of bias, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis appears safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence one cannot rule out that future trials may show that one treatment or another may be better in terms of complications. However, the trial size required to show such differences involves a clinical trial on more than 50,000 people and so it is unlikely that such large trials will be performed. Several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.
