Fixed‐dose combinations for treating pulmonary tuberculosis
What are fixed‐dose combinations and how might they improve care of people with tuberculosis 
Tuberculosis (TB) is an important health problem, especially in developing countries. The treatment for pulmonary TB in new patients includes four oral medicines taken for six months, sometimes as fixed‐dose combinations (FDCs) that are combined in one tablet, or taken separately as single‐drug formulations. The World Health Organization recommends prescribers use fixed‐dose combinations to reduce the number of tablets that people take. On the supply side, this might reduce prescribing errors and improve drug supply efficiency; on the patient's side, FDCS simplify treatment and improve adherence. 
We conducted a review to assess the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of FDCs compared with single‐drug formulations for treating people with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB. 
What the research says 
We searched for relevant trials up to 20 November 2015, and included 13 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 5824 people. Trials were published between 1987 and 2015 and included participants in treatment with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB in countries with high TB prevalence. Only two trials reported the HIV status of included participants. 
There is probably little or no difference in FDCs compared to single‐drug formulations for treatment failure (moderate quality evidence); relapse may be more frequent (low quality evidence); and the number of deaths were similar (moderate quality evidence). 
There is little or no difference in sputum smear or culture conversion (high quality evidence), and no difference was shown for serious adverse events (moderate quality evidence) or adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (low quality evidence). 
Authors’ conclusions 
We concluded that fixed‐dose combinations have similar efficacy to single‐drug formulations for treating people with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.
