Cell‐based therapy using different sources and different treatment regimens for 'no‐option' CLI patients 
Background 
Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is characterised by severe leg pain on walking and at rest and hard‐to‐heal wounds, which may lead to disability and death. The procedure that aims to improve blood flow to the affected limb, known as 'revascularisation', is the gold standard therapy. However, 25% to 40% of people with CLI are not suitable for or have failed previous revascularisation therapy. Therefore, for these patients, the only option for relieving pain and stopping wound infection from spreading is limb amputation. These patients are commonly referred to as 'no‐option' CLI patients. 
Cell‐based therapy is increasingly recognised as a promising novel treatment for CLI. Most of the data for this novel approach have been obtained from studies based on patients' own cells, also known as 'autologous cells'. However, current data on the efficacy of autologous cells are limited because available information about the sources used to obtain these cells (e.g. bone marrow, peripheral blood), the doses used (e.g. high or low cell dose), and the method of cell administration selected (e.g. cell injection into muscles or into blood vessels) is limited. In this review, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of autologous cell‐based therapy derived from different sources and prepared as different treatment regimens for 'no‐option' CLI patients. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We analysed the findings of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 359 CLI patients revealed by our literature search, which was current to 16 May 2018. 
We evaluated two main sources of stem cell treatment, namely, 'bone marrow‐mononuclear cells (BM‐MNCs)' and 'mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs)'. Limited data suggest that BM‐MNCs or mPBSCs resulted in similar rates of limb amputation and death. Also, the two cell sources appeared to yield similar numbers of patients with improved rest pain, ulcer healing, and lower limb blood flow parameters as measured via the ankle‐brachial index (ABI). However, data from one RCT show that mPBSC implantation resulted in improved transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcO₂) readings when compared to BM‐MNC. Data from one RCT show no clear difference in amputation rates between patients receiving high cell dose and low cell dose, and no difference in clinical outcomes whether patients received cell doses via intramuscular or intra‐articular routes. Study authors reported no significant short‐term adverse effects attributed to autologous cell implantation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence for all outcomes varied but was mostly low to very low owing to limitations in study design and lack of data for several important outcomes. Taken together, there is insufficient high‐quality evidence to assess the effects of using a particular source or treatment regimen of cell‐based therapy for CLI in clinical practice. Larger trials with longer follow‐up are needed to evaluate the long‐term benefits and safety of various cell‐based products for patients with CLI.
