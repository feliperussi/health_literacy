Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of exercise on bone mass in postmenopausal women. 
The review shows that for postmenopausal women 
‐        Exercise will improve bone mineral density slightly.
‐        Exercise will reduce the chances of having a fracture slightly.
These results might have happened by chance.
What is osteoporosis and exercise 
Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall. 
Exercise interventions are typically those that stress or mechanically load bones (when bones support the weight of the body or when movement is resisted for example when using weights) and include aerobics, strength training, walking and tai chi. 
Best estimate of what happens to postmenopausal women who exercise 
Bone mineral density at the spine 
People who exercised had on average 0.85% less bone loss than those who didn't exercise.
People who engaged in combinations of exercise types had on average 3.2% less bone loss than those who did not exercise. 
Bone mineral density at the hip 
People who exercised had on average 1.03% less bone loss than those who didn't exercise.
People who exercised by strength training had on average 1.03% less bone loss.
Fractures 
4 less women out of 100 who did exercise had a fracture.  (Absolute difference 4%).
7 women out of 100 who exercised had a fracture.
11 women out of 100 who did not exercise had a fracture.
