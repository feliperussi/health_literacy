Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis
Review question Does vitamin D supplementation reduce disease activity in people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? 
What is the issue? Several epidemiological, immunological, and genetic studies have reported an association between low vitamin D, measured as low blood 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels, and MS before and after the disease is triggered. Hence people with MS are screened for vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D preparations are given along with immunomodulatory therapy. Whether vitamin D supplementation improves relevant clinical outcomes (recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability) or decreases the number of lesions observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not clear. 
What did we do? We evaluated the benefits and harms of vitamin D in people with MS. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo, routine care, or low doses of vitamin D. 
What did we find? Our systematic search identified 12 studies enrolling 933 people with MS. Research shows that vitamin D has no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or new MRI gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions. Its effects on health‐related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Our confidence in these results is very low because vitamin D has been evaluated in only a few small trials that we judged as having high risk of bias. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe for people with MS included in our review, but available data are limited. 
Conclusions For people with MS, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no effect on relevant clinical outcomes or new MRI lesions. Vitamin D supplementation at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven trials are ongoing; they will likely provide further evidence for a future update of this review.
