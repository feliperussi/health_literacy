Optical coherence tomography measurement of central retinal thickness to diagnose diabetic macular oedema 
Background Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a thickening of the central part of the retina, the macula, that may affect people with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which the retina (a layer of tissue at the back of the eye) becomes progressively damaged. Diabetic macular oedema is detected by means of visual examination by an ophthalmologist. The most severe form of DMO ‐ clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO) ‐ is associated with sight loss in the long‐term. This condition is treatable. Laser photocoagulation (where a laser is used to burn off blood vessels) has been used for many years to reduce the risk of visual loss. More recently, antiangiogenic therapy (which prevents fluid leakage from retinal vessels) has been approved to try to improve vision. 
Review question Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is based on how light is reflected. It can be used to measure retinal thickness. We originally aimed to assess the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing diabetic macular oedema (DMO), as well as to investigate differences in diagnostic performance. However, the role of OCT is expanding so in the update of this review we also aimed to assess whether OCT might be considered the new standard for diagnosing DMO. 
Search date This review is updated as of June 2013. 
Study characteristics Our review included 10 studies (830 participants, 1387 eyes) published between 1998 and 2012. Nine of these studies investigated the ability of OCT to diagnose CSMO. 
Study funding sources There were no overt declarations of potential conflicts of interest in terms of the manufacturer of the OCT device being involved in funding the research. 
Key results We found that OCT retinal thickness measurement is not sufficiently accurate to detect CSMO, involving the centre of the macula, using clinical fundus examination as the reference standard. Of 10 patients with diabetic retinopathy, 5 of whom have CSMO, 1 of 5 with no CSMO would be wrongly diagnosed as having CSMO, and about 1 of 5 with CSMO would be missed.
