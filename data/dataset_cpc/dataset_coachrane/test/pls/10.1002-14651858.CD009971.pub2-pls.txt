Perioperative statin use to improve outcomes during and after noncardiac vascular surgery 
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often have widespread atherosclerosis and are at high risk of complications during and after the operation. (Atherosclerosis is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of an accumulation of fatty deposits such as cholesterol.) Statins are widely used to treat raised cholesterol levels but also confer beneficial effects on the inflammatory and circulatory systems. Their long‐term use in patients with vascular disease is well established. Accumulating evidence suggests that short‐term treatment with statins may reduce complications after cardiac surgery, but it is not yet clear whether there are any benefits for vascular surgery patients.    
In July 2012 we searched medical databases for controlled trials of participants who had undergone aortic or arterial surgery and were randomly assigned to either statins or placebo (or standard care). Many vascular surgery patients are already taking statins; therefore we also included trials that randomly assigned participants to different doses of statin. Statin treatment should have been started any time between the decision to operate and performance of the operation and continued for at least 48 hours after the operation. We wanted to investigate the effect of this short‐term statin therapy on the risk of death and cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke within 30 days of surgery. We also considered adverse effects of statins such as muscle pain. 
We found five studies that compared participants receiving statins with a control treatment or with placebo, but only three of these reported outcomes could be combined in the meta‐analyses. These three studies were of high quality but studied only 178 participants in total. This means that evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether statins improved patient outcomes after surgery. We were also not able to establish whether any adverse effects such as muscle pain were associated with statin use. 
We found that two studies had compared different doses of atorvastatin, but evidence was insufficient to determine whether any benefits or risks were associated with using a higher dose.   
Given the limited quantity of data obtained from randomized controlled trials, further studies are required to allow investigators to gather better information about whether prescribing statins around the time of vascular surgery can improve outcomes. However, widespread use of statins in patients before they need surgery may make these studies impracticable.
