Treatment with botulinum toxin type A or anticholinergic drugs for people with cervical dystonia (involuntary posturing of the head) 
The review question 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review. We assessed whether botulinum toxin type A (BtA) was more effective (reduction in severity, disability, and pain) and safer than anticholinergic drugs for people with cervical dystonia (involuntary positioning of the head). 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disorder that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition, affecting 57 to 280 people per million. It can be very disabling, and have a negative affect on a person's quality of life. In most cases, the cause is unknown; there is no cure. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disorder, it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin type A and anticholinergic drugs are powerful chemical substances that cause a diverse range of responses in the human body. BtA causes severe localised paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is injected). Anticholinergics, usually taken by mouth, cause more widespread symptoms, and can result in a dry mouth, visual disturbances, bowel and bladder difficulties, increased heart rate, sedation, and confusion or disorientation. Both can be used to treat many conditions, in particular, those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature to July 2020. We found one study that compared treatment with BtA (Dysport) versus an anticholinergic drug (trihexyphenidyl) for 12 weeks. The study included 66 participants, who had experienced cervical dystonia for an average of 9.4 years, but had never received BtA treatment. On average, they had moderate impairment. The average age of people in the study was 50.7 years. The trial was funded by the BtA drug manufacturer. 
Key results 
The results show that Dysport, when compared with trihexyphenidyl, may improve symptoms of cervical dystonia, pain, and quality of life. The risk of having an unpleasant or undesirable event, particularly dry mouth and memory issues, was increased in people taking trihexyphenidyl. 
We found no information on the effects of different doses of BtA, different formulas of BtA or types of anticholinergics, the usefulness of guiding injections by electromyography, or how long the effects lasted. 
Certainty in the evidence 
Due to limitations in the study methods and size of the study, we have very little confidence in the results. 
These conclusions may not apply to all people with cervical dystonia. They do not apply to long‐term use of either treatment.
