Chondroitin for osteoarthritis
We conducted a review of the effects of chondroitin sulfate for people with osteoarthritis. We found 43 studies with 9,110 people after searching for studies up to November 2013. Majority were studies of knee osteoarthritis (few hand, one hip) ranging from 1 month to 3 years. Several studies were funded by makers of chondroitin. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis: 
‐ Chondroitin may improve pain slightly in the short‐term (less than 6 months);
‐ Chondroitin improves knee pain by 20% in slightly more people;
‐ Chondroitin probably improves quality of life slightly as measured by Lequesne's index (combined measure of pain, function, and disability); 
‐ Chondroitin has little or no difference in adverse and serious adverse events versus other agents; and 
‐ Chondroitin slightly slows down the narrowing of joint space on X‐rays of the affected joint. 
We identified a lot of studies in which unsound methods were used to assess the effects of chondroitin. For some outcomes, there was not enough data. In some studies, whose methodological quality was better, chondroitin showed no improvement in pain and in physical function. Other analyses based on different methodological quality criteria reported improvement in pain and physical functionality when chondroitin was given. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is chondroitin? 
Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage, but this bone growth may make the situation worse. This can make the joint painful and unstable, which can affect physical function or ability to use the joint. 
Chondroitin is an over‐the‐counter nutritional supplement made primarily of chondroitin sulfate. It is said to work by stopping the degradation of cartilage and restoring lost cartilage. It also contains sulfur‐containing amino acids, which are essential building blocks for cartilage molecules in the human body. 
What happens to people with osteoarthritis who take chondroitin? 
Pain level after 6 months (lower score is better) 
‐ People who took chondroitin scored 10 points lower on 0 to 100 pain scale than those who took a placebo (10% absolute difference). 
‐ People who took chondroitin rated their pain at 18 on a 0 to 100 scale.
‐ People who took placebo rated their pain at 28 on a 0 to 100 scale.
In studies longer than 6 months, we are uncertain whether pain is reduced more by chondroitin than placebo. 
Reduction in knee pain by 20% (as measured by the WOMAC1 Pain subscale) 
‐ 6 more people out of 100 experienced improvement of 20% in their knee pain (6% absolute difference). 
‐ 53 people out of 100 who took chondroitin experienced improvement in their knee pain compared to 47 people out of 100 who took placebo. 
Lequesne’s index (a combination index of pain and physical function, indicating quality of life) after 6 months 
‐ People who took chondroitin scored 2 points lower (better) on Lequesne's index (score range 0 to 24). 
‐ People who took chondroitin scored 5 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index.
‐ People who took placebo scored 7 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index.
Radiographic outcome: reduction in minimum joint space width (mm) (smaller decrease in reduction in minimum joint space width is better) after 2 years 
‐ People who took chondroitin had 0.18 mm less reduction in minimum joint space width than those who took placebo. 
‐ People who took chondroitin had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.12 mm. 
‐ People who took placebo had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.30 mm.
Serious adverse events 
‐ 3 fewer of 100 people who took chondroitin experienced serious adverse events (such as a serious lung infection or tuberculosis). 
‐ 3 of 100 people experienced a serious adverse event with chondroitin compared to 6 of 100 people who took placebo.  
 People who dropped out of the studies for adverse events 
‐ People who took chondroitin had no difference in the risk of dropping out of the studies for adverse events than those who took a placebo.This may have happened by chance.
