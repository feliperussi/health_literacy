Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence).
