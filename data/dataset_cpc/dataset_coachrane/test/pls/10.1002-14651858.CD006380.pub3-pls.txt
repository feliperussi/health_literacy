Drugs to treat phantom limb pain in people with missing limbs
Background 
People can experience pain in a missing body part, for example after limb amputation. This is known as phantom limb pain. Various medications have been tried as treatments for phantom limb pain. It is uncertain whether any of the following medications work: botulinum toxin A, opioids, N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (e.g. ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan), anticonvulsants, antidepressants, calcitonin, and local anaesthetics. It is unclear whether these medications can help with pain, function, mood, sleep, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and safety (e.g. adverse events) in the short and long term. 
Key results 
For this updated review, we repeated the search for relevant clinical trials in April 2016. We found one new trial, including 14 studies with a total of 269 participants. One small initial report showed that botulinum toxin A did not reduce phantom limb pain compared to lidocaine/methylprednisolone. Morphine, gabapentin, and ketamine provided short‐term pain relief compared with placebo, but the findings were mostly based on small studies. The results for calcitonin (versus placebo; versus ketamine) and local anaesthetics (versus placebo) were variable. The trials were very different, which made it difficult to combine results for the different drugs. Most studies did not report sleep, depression or mood, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment, or the number of people who did not finish the study. 
As they relied on a few small studies, results must be interpreted with caution. There was not enough information about long‐term effectiveness and safety. Large, good‐quality studies with longer follow‐ups and outcomes that are important to patients are needed. Bigger and better studies will help us to make firmer conclusions on the best pain relief available for these patients.
