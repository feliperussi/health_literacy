Interventions to optimise prescribing for older people in care homes
Background 
Older people living in care homes (also called nursing homes, residential homes, skilled‐nursing facilities, assisted‐living facilities or aged‐care facilities) have many complex physical and mental health problems. Care home residents are prescribed many medicines compared to people who live in their own homes, with an average of eight medicines being common. International research has shown that these medicines are often not well managed, with some residents prescribed medicines inappropriately. This has the potential to lead to harmful side effects and a loss of benefit. For these reasons, it is important to make sure that care home residents are prescribed the right medicines at the right doses. This is an update of a previously published review (Alldred 2013). 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies involving 10,953 residents in 355 care homes in ten countries that evaluated interventions to optimise prescribing for care home residents. Most of the interventions had several components, often involving a review of medicines with a pharmacist and doctor. Some interventions included a teaching component and one study used Information Technology (IT). 
Key results 
We found no evidence of benefit of the interventions with respect to reducing adverse drug events (harmful effects caused by medicines) or death. One study led to residents having fewer days in hospital; however, the majority of studies did not show a benefit in relation to reducing hospital admissions. One study led to a slower decline in health‐related quality of life. Problems relating to medicines were found and addressed through the interventions used in the studies. Prescribing was improved based on criteria used to assess the appropriateness of prescribing in five studies.
