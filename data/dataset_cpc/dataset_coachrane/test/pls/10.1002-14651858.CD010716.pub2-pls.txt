Surgery versus non‐surgical management for unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction in newborns and infants less than two years of age 
Review question 
Do children with unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction do better with or without surgery? 
Background 
Some newborn and infants less than two years of age are shown using ultrasound to have an enlargement of the pelvis of the kidney. This is the anatomical structure where the urine collects before it is transported down the ureter to the bladder. Enlargement of the pelvis of the kidney is a concern due to possible blockage of urine flow, not unlike how a river widens in front of a dam. 
Longer‐term blockage of the urine flow for months and years may damage the kidney and lead to other problems such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones. Surgery can remove a blockage if it occurs, but it also has downsides including risks of complications. It is unclear whether these operations are necessary. 
Results 
We searched for studies up to 13 June 2016 and found two trials that compared groups of newborns and infants less than two years of age, including a total of 107 children who had surgery or no surgery and were followed for up to five years. Based on very low‐quality evidence, we found that short‐term kidney function (after six and 12 months) was similar in the two groups. Very low‐quality evidence also showed that after surgery, the pelvis of the kidney was smaller and urine seemed to flow better from the kidney down the ureter. However, due to the methods and size and of the studies, we are very uncertain about these results. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether one group of participants did better longer term, had fewer complications, or had better quality of life.
