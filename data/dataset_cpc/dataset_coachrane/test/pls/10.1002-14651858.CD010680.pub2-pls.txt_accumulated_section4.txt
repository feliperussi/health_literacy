Ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial disease
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the legs affects 13% of people over 50 years of age. Sometimes PAD is "silent" and people are unaware they have it, but PAD can cause pain in the legs, especially with walking, and this type of symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of people in the Western world between the ages of 55 and 74 years. In PAD, fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) and blood clots cause the arteries to narrow and block. This leads to poor blood flow to the muscles during exercise, causing the classical symptom of muscle pain during walking that goes away after rest (intermittent claudication). In severe cases of PAD, symptoms of rest pain, ulceration and gangrene may develop and, if untreated, can lead to lower limb amputation. People with PAD are also at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. 
The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a test that is used to facilitate diagnosis of PAD. This test uses a device for measuring blood pressure with an inflatable cuff, and blood pressure measurements are taken at the upper arm and the ankle. The equipment can be manual or digital with automatic electronic calculation of blood pressure. The ABI is widely used for assessment of PAD by specialist nurses, physicians, surgeons and podiatrists working in hospitals. Dividing blood pressure recorded at the ankle by that recorded at the arm produces a ratio. Ratios of 0.90 to 1.30 are considered normal for adults, and ratios less than 0.8 indicate that PAD is present. Lower readings (< 0.7) suggest that the disease is severe and people might develop ulcers and gangrene. People with mild to moderate PAD can arrive at a diagnosis by several routes when using the ABI: during routine diabetic foot checks in general practice, in community health clinic or hospital settings, as a screening test for PAD in people who have no symptoms and during assessment of people presenting with exertional leg pain suggestive of PAD. Once a diagnosis of PAD is established, treatment will include prescribed secondary prevention therapy and lifestyle advice (exercise, smoking cessation, diet, weight), and for those with impaired quality of life, treatment may include supervised exercise therapy, or revascularisation, which commonly involves endovascular treatment rather than surgery. 
In hospitals, other tests may be used to diagnose PAD. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) shows blood flow in the arteries and is non‐invasive, but only an experienced radiologist can achieve useful images. Hospital staff can use other tests to image the blood vessels, namely, computerised tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and catheter angiography.
