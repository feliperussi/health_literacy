Vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy
Taking vitamin C supplements in pregnancy 
What is the issue? 
Does vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy improve outcomes for mothers and babies, and does it have any adverse effects? 
Why is this important? 
Having a low intake of vitamin C could be associated with complications in pregnancy such as high blood pressure with swelling of the hands, feet and face (pre‐eclampsia), anaemia and having a small baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
This review included data from 29 trials involving over 24,000 pregnant women from 17 different countries. Four trials did not contribute data to the review. The overall risk of bias of the trials was low to unclear, and the evidence was moderate to high quality. The most common daily dosage of vitamin C was 1000 mg, which was used in 15 studies. The findings indicated that routine supplementation with vitamin C during pregnancy, either alone or in combination with other supplements (mainly vitamin E) did not improve outcomes for women and their babies. There was a 36% relative reduction in the placenta coming away early from the uterine wall (placental abruption) in women given vitamin C supplements (eight studies, over 15,700 women); this was rated as high‐quality evidence. However, it was unclear whether this finding was due to vitamin C or another agent, as most trials gave women vitamin C combined with vitamin E. In the studies that gave women vitamin C only, there was a reduction in prelabour rupture of the membranes (PROM) occurring either preterm or at term. However, there was an increased risk of term PROM in the studies that gave women vitamin C and vitamin E. Therefore, further research is required to examine the role of vitamin C in reducing placental abruption and the development of PROM. The review found in one study only an increased risk of abdominal pain with vitamin C indicating there may be harms associated with vitamin C supplements in pregnancy. 
What does this mean? 
Taking vitamin C supplements during pregnancy does not help to prevent problems in pregnancy including stillbirth, the death of the baby, preterm birth, pre‐eclampsia or low birthweight babies.
