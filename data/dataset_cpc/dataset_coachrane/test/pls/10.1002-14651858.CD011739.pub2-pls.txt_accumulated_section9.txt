Use of different methods of detecting if a baby is large‐for‐gestational‐age, to improve health outcomes 
What is the issue? 
A baby may sometimes grow to be bigger than expected and be born with a high birthweight. When overgrowth of the baby is suspected during a pregnancy the mother can have extra scheduled antenatal visits and tests to assess her health and the health of her developing baby. 
Why is this important? 
Tests can detect if there are signs of any deterioration in the baby’s condition, or development of complications in the mother. The specified frequency and combinations of tests vary with local protocols and policies. Tests may include fetal movement counting, fetal heart rate assessment (cardiotocography), checking the mother's blood sugars or the use of ultrasound for fetal growth scans, Doppler ultrasound examination of fetal blood vessels and assessing the volume of fluid around the baby. 
Large babies are associated with increased risks to both the mother and baby, including increased risk of intra‐uterine death and stillbirth. At birth the baby is at a higher risk of low oxygen levels, shoulder dystocia, nerve injuries, bone fracture, low blood sugar levels, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Maternal complications include prolonged labour, operative births including caesarean section, perineal trauma, postpartum haemorrhage and uterine rupture. 
Interventions that may slow growth acceleration and improve health outcomes for the mother and her baby include dietary advice, lifestyle modification, and in women with diabetes or gestational diabetes blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies on 10 August 2015 but did not find any randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of performing extra tests on health outcomes in pregnant women with overgrowth of the baby after 20 weeks gestation.
