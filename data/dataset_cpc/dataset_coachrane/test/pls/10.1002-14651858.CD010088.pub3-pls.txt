Routine vaginal examinations in labour
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if routine vaginal examinations for assessing labour progress are effective and acceptable to women, and to compare the use of these examinations to other methods of assessing labour progress. 
Why is this important? 
Labour is usually monitored to ensure that it is progressing as expected, and that there are no signs of abnormal progress that might be harmful to mother or baby. The method most commonly used is routine vaginal examination (undertaken at regular time intervals), which provides information on how dilated the woman's cervix is and the position of the baby. Very slow labours can be a sign of underlying problems that may require interventions to speed up labour and birth (augmentation). However, slow labours can also be a normal variation of labour progress, and recent evidence suggests that if mother and baby are well, length of labour or cervical dilation alone should not be used to decide whether labour is progressing normally. 
Other methods to assess labour progress include the use of ultrasound, assessing how the mother behaves, and external physical signs of progress, such as a purple line that develops between the mother's buttocks as labour progresses. However, these methods are not standard practice. The most effective method to assess labour progress has not been established. 
Vaginal examinations can be uncomfortable, painful, and distressing. If slow but normal labours are misdiagnosed as being abnormal, this can lead to unnecessary interventions, such as augmentation or caesarean section. Some women may not want these interventions, and their use can cause emotional and physical harm. Misdiagnosis of labour progress either way can be physically and emotionally devastating. Women's views and experiences of the methods used to assess labour progress should be considered, alongside evidence of effectiveness. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched in February 2021 and included four studies, with data for 744 women and babies. Overall, the evidence was uncertain or very uncertain due to the study methods and the inclusion of small numbers of women and babies. 
Routine vaginal examinations versus routine ultrasound (one study, 83 women and babies)  
Study in Turkey involving women with spontaneous onset of labour and who had given birth before: routine vaginal examinations may result in a slight increase in pain compared to routine ultrasound to assess labour progress.  
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; augmentation of labour; spontaneous vaginal birth; chorioamnionitis (inflammation or infection of the membranes around the baby); neonatal infection; admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 
Routine vaginal examinations versus routine rectal examinations (one study, 307 women and babies)  
Study in Ireland involving women in labour at term. Compared with routine rectal examinations, routine vaginal examinations may have little or no effect on: augmentation of labour; spontaneous vaginal birth; neonatal infections; admission to NICU.  
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; maternal pain. 
Routine four‐hourly vaginal examinations versus routine two‐hourly examinations (one study, 150 women and babies)  
UK study involving women having their first baby in labour at term. Compared with routine two‐hourly vaginal examinations, routine four‐hourly vaginal examinations may have little or no effect on augmentation of labour or spontaneous vaginal birth ‐ the results were compatible with both a benefit and harm. 
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes: positive birth experience; chorioamnionitis; neonatal infection; admission to NICU; maternal pain. 
Routine vaginal examinations versus vaginal examinations as indicated (one study, 204 women and babies)  
Study in Malaysia involving women having their first baby and being induced at term. Compared with vaginal examinations as indicated, routine four‐hourly vaginal examinations may result in more women having their labour augmented. There may be little or no effect on spontaneous vaginal birth, chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection, or admission to NICU.  
The study did not assess our other primary outcomes of positive birth experience or maternal pain. 
What does this mean? 
We cannot be certain which method for assessing labour progress is most effective or acceptable to women. Further evidence is needed to identify the best way to assess labour progress and how this may affect women's birth experiences.
