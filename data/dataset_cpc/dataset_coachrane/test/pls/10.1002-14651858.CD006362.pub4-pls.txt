Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for the common cold
Review question  We carried out a review on the effects of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating pain or respiratory symptoms such as cough associated with the common cold. 
Background  The common cold is the most common and widespread illness known to humans. NSAIDs, for example, aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, have analgesic (pain‐reducing) and antipyretic (fever‐reducing) effects. NSAIDs have been widely used for over a century for the treatment of pain and fever associated with the common cold. 
Study characteristics  The evidence is current to April 2015. This review found nine studies (1069 participants of both genders, including children, adults and older people from the USA, Japan, Belgium and Denmark) that compared various NSAIDs either with each other or with an inactive substance that has no treatment value (placebo). 
Key results  Our findings suggest that NSAIDs may improve most analgesia‐related symptoms caused by the common cold (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain), but there is no clear evidence that NSAIDs are effective in improving coughs and runny noses caused by the common cold. Some of the included trials reported gastrointestinal complaints, rash and oedema (fluid retention) in the NSAIDs group. 
Quality of the evidence  The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for each outcome is quite small. 
Conclusion  NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving the discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using NSAIDs for colds.
