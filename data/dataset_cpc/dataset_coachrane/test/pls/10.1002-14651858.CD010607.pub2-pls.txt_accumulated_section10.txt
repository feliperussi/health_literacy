Interventions for treating severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum) 
What is the issue and why is it important? 
Although severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum) rarely causes death, it is an important cause of ill health with emotional, physical, and economic consequences. Women may need hospital treatment and may not be able to work and it occasionally causes pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes for babies such as low birthweight. Many pharmaceutical, complementary, and alternative therapies are available and the objective of this review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum. 
What evidence did we find? 
Twenty‐five trials (involving 2052 women) were included examining 18 different comparisons covering a range of interventions including acupressure/acupuncture, outpatient care, intravenous fluids, and various commonly used anti‐sickness drugs. The quality of included studies was mixed and for most outcomes findings were from single studies with low numbers of women taking part and the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality. We have described findings for selected important comparisons below, the remaining comparisons are described in detail in the main text. 
There was no clear evidence of differences between acupuncture and placebo for symptoms of anxiety or depression, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth or perinatal death. 
There was insufficient evidence to identify clear differences between acupuncture and metoclopramide (an anti‐nausea medication) for reduction or cessation in nausea or vomiting. 
Women taking vitamin B6 had a slightly longer hospital stay compared with placebo but there was no clear evidence of differences in other outcomes including the average number of episodes of vomiting, hospital readmission rate, or side effects. 
A comparison between two anti‐nausea medications, metoclopramide and ondansetron, identified no clear difference in the severity of nausea or vomiting, but more women taking metoclopramide complained of drowsiness and dry mouth. In a study comparing metoclopramide with promethazine, more women taking promethazine reported drowsiness and dizziness but there were no clear differences between groups for other important outcomes including quality of life and other side effects. In a study looking at ondansetron versus promethazine women spent similar lengths of time in hospital but there was increased sedation with promethazine. 
Regarding corticosteroids, there was no difference in days of hospital admission compared to placebo, but there was a decreased readmission rate. For other important outcomes including pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital abnormalities, preterm birth and side effects, there was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups.
