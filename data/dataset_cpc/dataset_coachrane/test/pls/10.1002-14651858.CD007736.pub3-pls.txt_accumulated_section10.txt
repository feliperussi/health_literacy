Do supportive, educational and behavioural interventions improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea? 
What is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)? 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. People with OSA spend more time in light sleep and less time in deep sleep and consequently experience daytime sleepiness, which may affect their daily life. 
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a treatment that delivers pressurised air to keep the airway open. CPAP treatment involves a machine with three main parts: a device that fits over nose and mouth, a tube that connects the mask to the device's motor; and a motor that blows air into the tube. 
Review question 
We already know that CPAP treats OSA effectively in most people by improving symptoms resulting from OSA. However many people do not use their CPAP machine as much as is recommended. We wanted to look at interventions designed to educate and motivate people with OSA to use their CPAP machines more. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at evidence from randomised, parallel‚Äêgroup, controlled studies. Following a comprehensive literature search and assessment of trials, we included 41 studies (number of participants = 9005). Most people experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and had newly diagnosed OSA. Duration of studies ranged from 28 days to two years. 
Results 
We grouped the trials into those that gave people a) education, b) a supportive intervention, c) behavioural intervention, and d) a mixed intervention (using all thee techniques).
