Interventions for anaemia in dialysis patients who are resistant to erythropoietin
Many people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis develop anaemia (too few or poor quality red blood cells). Drugs in the erythropoiesis‐stimulating family increase the production of red blood cells to resolve anaemia. Although ESAs have been highly beneficial for many, about 10% of people get either low or no benefit from treatment. Inability to control and stabilise anaemia can lead to poor rates of survival and increased risk of stroke so it is important to find effective treatment to manage anaemia in people who do not respond adequately to ESA therapy. 
We searched the literature to find evidence about how best to treat people who do not benefit from ESA treatment. We found two studies: one that assessed intravenous vitamin C and another that looked at high‐flux dialyser fluids as possible therapies. These studies were small (total of 90 participants) and were selective: they included haemodialysis, but not peritoneal dialysis, patients. This meant that the results of these studies could not be applied to all people with CKD on dialysis who were receiving ESA therapy. The lack of evidence meant that we could not determine or recommend an alternate treatment for people who do not respond to ESA. 
More powerful and rigorous studies are needed to systematically assess all therapies that are aimed to treat people who do not respond to ESA therapy. Until such evidence is available, no therapy can be confidently recommended for this problem.
