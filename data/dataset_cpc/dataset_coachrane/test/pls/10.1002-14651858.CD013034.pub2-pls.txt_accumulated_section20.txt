Surgery for patella tendinopathy (jumper's knee)
Background 
Patella tendinopathy is a painful condition that commonly affects jumping athletes who train a lot, for example those who play volleyball and basketball. Many people with the condition are unable to continue their chosen sport at the same level of competition or intensity of training. There are many treatments for the condition, the most common of which is a particular type of exercise called eccentric exercise (where the tendon is under tension while the muscle lengthens). 
Other treatments for patella tendinopathy include oral and topical analgesia (pain‐relief medication taken orally or applied to the skin), various injectables (e.g. corticosteroids) and surgery. Surgery is used if other treatments fail, and is the treatment assessed in this review. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to July 2018. We searched online databases for all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) that compared surgical treatment with non‐operative treatment in adults with patellar tendinopathy. We found two studies; they compared open surgical removal to eccentric exercises (one study involving 40 people) and arthroscopic surgery to sclerosing injections (these scar and block the blood vessels supplying nerve fibres to the diseased tendon) (one study involving 56 people). The studies were performed in an outpatient setting in two countries (Norway and Sweden). The majority of people in the studies were male, with a mean age ranging from 27 to 31 years, and mean symptom duration of 24 to 33 months. Trials were conducted without funding (financial support) from industry (medical or device companies), but some authors from the one study received funding from pharmaceutical companies in addition to research funding from non‐industry sources. 
Key results 
Compared with eccentric exercises, open surgery offered little benefit at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows). 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better) or by 0.4 points on a scale of zero to 10 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 1.3 points.
People who had eccentric exercises rated their pain as 1.7 points.
Global assessment of success (those who reported no pain at 12 months) 
10% fewer people had no pain (ranging from 38% less to 18% more), or 10 fewer people out of 100. 
Twenty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with surgery.
Thirty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with eccentric exercises.
Withdrawals 
No participants in either group withdrew from the study.
The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). 
Compared with sclerosing injections, arthroscopic (keyhole) surgery offered some reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows; further studies are likely to change these results).
