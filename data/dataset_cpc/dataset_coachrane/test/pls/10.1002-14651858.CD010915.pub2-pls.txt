Programs for preventing pregnancy and disease through using two methods of contraception
Use of two contraceptive methods (dual‐method use) refers to using condoms plus another modern method of contraception. The latter method is usually hormonal (like birth control pills) or a non‐hormonal intrauterine system. Unprotected sex results in disease and death in many areas of the world due to HIV/STI. Millions of women, especially in lower‐resource areas, also have an unmet need for preventing unplanned pregnancy. We examined studies of dual‐method use, which can better prevent pregnancy and protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
Through January 2014, we did computer searches for studies of programs to improve use of dual‐methods. We wrote to researchers to find missing data. Studies examined a behavioral intervention for improving dual‐method use. The educational program had to address preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI by using condoms plus another modern contraceptive. The intervention was compared with a different program, usual care, or no intervention. 
We only found four studies to include. Three were randomized trials and the fourth was a pilot study for one of the included trials. The programs differed from one another. They included computer‐delivered sessions tailored for each person; phone counseling added to clinic counseling; and case management plus a peer‐leadership program. In the latter study, more women in the intervention group reported regular use of dual methods, namely birth control pills plus condoms, than the control group. The pilot study reported a trend toward more regular dual‐method use for the intervention group compared to the control group. The other two trials did not show any major difference between the study groups in reported use of dual methods or in test results for pregnancy or STIs. 
We found few programs to improve use of dual methods, and only one showed an effect. The reports gave enough information on how the interventions were conducted. The studies had adequate follow‐up periods of 12 to 24 months. However, the overall quality of results was low, mainly due to study design and losing many women to follow up.
