Nortriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines to those used for pain from damaged tissue. Medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen are not usually effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. 
Nortriptyline is an antidepressant from the same class of medicines as amitriptyline, which is widely recommended for treating neuropathic pain; nortriptyline may also be useful in these painful conditions. 
In January 2015, we performed searches to look for clinical trials where nortriptyline was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. We found six studies, with 310 participants with various neuropathic pain conditions. Studies were randomised and double‚Äêblind, but often with small numbers of participants. It was not possible to combine information from the different studies, but individually most studies indicated equivalent benefit from nortriptyline (usually at a dose between 50 mg and 100 mg daily) when compared with amitriptyline or chlorimipramine (other antidepressants), gabapentin (an antiepileptic), morphine (an opioid), or placebo (very low quality evidence). More people experienced adverse events with nortriptyline than with placebo, but numbers were similar for nortriptyline and other active medicines (very low quality evidence). 
There was too little information of adequate quality to be sure that nortriptyline works as a pain medicine in the type of neuropathic pain studies in this review. Other medicines have been shown to be effective.
