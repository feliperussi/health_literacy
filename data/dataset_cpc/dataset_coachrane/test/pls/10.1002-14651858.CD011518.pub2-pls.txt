Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for women with breast cancer
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) benefits women with breast cancer. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 14 studies, most of which included women with early breast cancer. 
Key messages 
The women's health was monitored at different time points: straight after completing MBSR, up to six months after completing MBSR and up to two years after MBSR. 
MBSR may slightly improve quality of life at the end of the intervention but result in little to no difference in women's overall well‐being (quality of life) later on. MBSR probably reduces anxiety and depression, and probably improves quality of sleep at both the end of MBSR and up to six months later. Women reported being less tired just after completing MBSR but not up to 6 months later. There was no information available on survival or adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
Women with breast cancer mostly experience diagnosis and treatment as a severe and life‐threatening situation that may drastically affect their quality of life, causing symptoms such as sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Previous research shows that MBSR seems to benefit patients with lung cancer, mood disorders or chronic pain, so it may also benefit women with breast cancer. 
MBSR is an eight‐week programme that aims to reduce stress by developing mindfulness, meaning that one practises moment‐by‐moment awareness in a non‐judgmental and accepting way. We wanted to study whether MBSR benefits women with breast cancer with regard to quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue and quality of sleep. We also looked at its influence on survival and adverse events related to cancer therapy. 
We searched for studies that compared MBSR versus no treatment, and we studied the results at the end of the intervention, up to six months after the intervention and up to 2 years after the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 14 relevant studies including mostly women with early breast cancer. Most studies considered women who had completed cancer treatment. We could analyse only the results of 10 studies including 1571 participants; the other four studies did not report (usable) results; queries to the authors were unsuccessful. Of the 10 studies analysed, 6 were from the USA, 3 from Europe, and 1 from China. 
The review shows MBSR may improve quality of life slightly at the end of the intervention but may result in little to no difference up to six months or up to two years after completing MBSR. At the end of the intervention, MBSR reduces depression, probably slightly reduces fatigue and anxiety, and probably improves quality of sleep. Up to six months later, MBSR probably slightly reduces anxiety and slightly improves quality of sleep, and it slightly reduces depression. There was a benefit on fatigue at the end of the intervention but not up to six months later. However, for all beneficial effects except for short‐term depression, the results we found could be due to chance. Up to two years after the intervention, MBSR probably results in little to no difference in anxiety, depression and quality of life. No long‐term data were available for fatigue or quality of sleep. No study reported data on survival or adverse events.
