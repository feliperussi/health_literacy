Single crowns or routine fillings for the restoration of root‐filled teeth
Review question 
This review (an update of the original published in 2012) has been conducted to assess whether there is a difference in the effects of restoration of root‐filled teeth (with or without post and core) by indirect restorations (commonly crowns, inlays, or onlays) compared to conventional filling materials placed directly into the tooth. 
Background 
Root filling is a fairly routine dental procedure in which the injured or dead nerve of a tooth is removed and replaced by a root canal filling. However, the restoration of root‐filled teeth can be quite challenging as these teeth tend to be weaker than healthy ones. A dentist may use crowns (restorations made outside of the mouth and then cemented into place) or conventional fillings (direct filling with materials such as amalgam or composite/plastic resin). Although crowns may help to protect root‐filled teeth by covering them, conventional fillings demand less in terms of time, costs and removal of tooth structure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature until 26 March 2015. This review includes one study with 117 participants in which a tooth (117 premolars) received a carbon fibre post, and was restored with either a fused porcelain to metal crown or a routine white filling. The study was of short duration (three years), included a relatively small number of participants, and was assessed to be at a high risk of bias due to missing results for people who dropped out of the study.
