Use of rapid point‐of‐care testing for infection to guide doctors prescribing antibiotics for acute respiratory infections in primary care settings 
Review question  We reviewed the evidence of the effect and safety of a rapid test of infection at point‐of‐care for using antibiotics in people with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) (e.g. common colds) in primary care. 
Background  Antibiotic treatment is common in ARIs despite the fact that the vast majority are caused by viruses, against which antibiotics are ineffective and unnecessary. The concern is that antibiotics may cause side effects and are directly associated with antibiotic resistance in common bacteria, causing treatment failure and complications, including death. Antibiotics have a modest, if any, effect against the majority of ARIs. Their use must be balanced against risking higher levels of antibiotic resistance, side effects and costs. Biomarkers of infection are proteins or components of the immune system that participate in the body's acute response to infection. No tests are currently able to provide perfect diagnostic accuracy for infections. This could lead to over‐ as well as under‐diagnosis. Some tests have been developed that assess the presence of infections by looking for certain of these biomarkers. These are rapid tests that may be used during the consultation by primary care doctors when people go to see them with symptoms of an ARI. In the correct clinical context these point‐of‐care tests could assist primary care doctors by identifying people with infections that are most likely to respond to antibiotics. We looked at the evidence for these tests to assess the possible harms and benefits of implementing such a strategy in primary health care.
