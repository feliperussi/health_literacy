Corticosteroids for preventing serious breathing problems in the newborn after caesarean section at term 
What is the issue? 
Babies born at term (at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy) by planned (elective) caesarean section, before onset of labour, are more likely to develop breathing complications than babies born vaginally. Giving injections called corticosteroids to the mother has been shown to reduce the risk of breathing problems in babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy, but it is not clear if they are also useful for babies born by caesarean section at term. 
Why is this important? 
Caesarean section increases the risk of a term newborn developing breathing problems, such as rapid breathing over the first few days (known as transient tachypnoea of the neonate) and the more serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The affected babies may need treatment in special care units. This risk decreases from 37 weeks to 39 weeks of gestation, at which stage it is low. Most caesarean sections are performed after 39 weeks of gestation, but there are some instances when babies need to be born earlier. The aim of this review was to investigate if corticosteroids can reduce the rates of breathing problems prior to caesarean section, without causing problems for the mother or the infant. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies that met our criteria for being trustworthy and compared the effects of corticosteroids against a placebo (dummy) treatment or against usual care. We rated our confidence in the findings based on factors such as the number of studies, study methods, number of women and babies involved, the number of events and the variability of the findings.
