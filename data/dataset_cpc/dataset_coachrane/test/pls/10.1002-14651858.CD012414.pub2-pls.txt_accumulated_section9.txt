Penile rehabilitation for post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction
Review question 
How well do treatments work to restore men's ability to have erections after surgery for prostate cancer? 
Background 
Many men have problems with erections after having their prostate removed for prostate cancer. Studies suggest that taking certain medicines or using devices to help with erection may help men's erections recover faster and better when used on a regular, scheduled basis (like daily or twice a week) rather than as needed. However, it is unclear how well these treatments actually work. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1699 participants. Five trials compared the scheduled use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (a type of medicine) to either no treatment or a placebo (a pretend drug with no effect). Two studies compared the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors either as a daily prescription or as needed. One study compared the daily use of either a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or a medicine called prostaglandin E1 that is placed into the tip of the penis like a suppository. The main outcomes of this review that we felt were most important to men were how good they thought their erections were (self‐reported potency), how good their erections were based on a specialised erection questionnaire (quality of erections) and any whether there were any major unwanted side effects. 
Key results 
We found that the men who used these medicines on a scheduled basis may have had similar self‐reported erections and quality of erections (based on questionnaires they filled out) as men who took no medication regularly or use it as needed. They also had similar rates of serious unwanted side effects and similar rates of stopping the drug before the end of the treatment duration. However, we are very uncertain of these findings. We were unable to research whether these results would be different in different groups of men based on whether the surgeon tried to preserve the nerves that help with erections or not, based on men's age and how good their erections were beforehand because we found no studies.
