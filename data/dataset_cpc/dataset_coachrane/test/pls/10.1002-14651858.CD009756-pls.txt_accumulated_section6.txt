Mobile phone text messaging to help patients with HIV infection take their antiretroviral medications every day 
More than 34 million people are presently living with HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help these people to live longer, healthier lives, but because of side‐effects, adherence (taking these medications every day) can be difficult. Mobile phone text‐messaging has the potential to help promote adherence in these patients. 
Two randomised controlled trials from Kenya were included in the review. One trial compared short weekly text messages against standard care. The other trial compared short daily, long daily, short weekly and long weekly messages against standard care. 
In the trial comparing only short weekly messages to standard care, text messaging was associated with lower risk of non‐adherence at 12 months, and with the non‐occurrence of virologic failure at 12 months. 
Combining the data from both trials, weekly mobile phone text‐messaging was associated with greater ART adherence at 48‐52 weeks. The effect of short weekly text‐messaging was also significant. 
In the trial that compared different intervals and lengths for text‐messaging to standard care, long weekly text‐messaging was not significantly associated with a lower risk of non‐adherence compared to standard care. Patients receiving weekly text‐messages of any length were at lower risk of non‐adherence at 48 weeks than were patients receiving daily messages of any length. There were no significant differences between weekly text‐messaging of any length and between short or long messaging at either interval. Compared to standard care, any daily text‐messaging, whether short or long, did not reduce the risk for non‐adherence.
