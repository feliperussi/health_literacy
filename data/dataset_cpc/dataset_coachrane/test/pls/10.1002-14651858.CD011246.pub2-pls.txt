Drug or psychological interventions for preventing depression in people with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
People with long‐term illness or other physical health conditions have a higher risk than other people of developing depression. This can reduce their quality of life. Depression is characterised by symptoms such as low mood, feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in things that once gave pleasure, and other symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances. People with long‐term physical conditions who develop depression are more likely to worsen in their illnesses and are more likely to die. Therefore, preventing depression in people with long‐term physical conditions should be an important goal in healthcare. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
We wanted to know whether standard interventions for treating depression (i.e. psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs) can also safely be used to prevent the onset of an depressive episode in those adults at high risk for depression due to their long‐term physical condition, but who do not yet show depressive symptoms. We also wanted to know whether these interventions worked in preventing recurrent depression, in those patients with long‐term physical conditions who had a history of depression. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical and mental health care providers (including physicians and psychologists) and pharmacists, as well as adults with long‐term physical conditions, their relatives and care‐givers. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
This review includes 11 trials comparing a psychological intervention (problem‐solving therapy) to treatment as usual; or comparing pharmacological antidepressant interventions (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine/nortriptyline, milnacipran, or melatonin) to placebo. For the psychological intervention, we found only one trial, including 194 people with age‐related macular degeneration (an eye disease). For pharmacological interventions, we included 10 trials comprising 1009 people. Due to some participants not completing the studies, we could only analyse data for 837 participants. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Our analyses show that people with long‐term physical conditions may be less likely to develop depression during treatment with problem solving therapy, or with different types of antidepressants. However, these interventions appear to be beneficial only during treatment. Three to 12 months after treatment, there was no significant difference in onset of depression between the groups that had the interventions and those that did not. Therefore, preventive interventions might be effective in preventing depression onset only for the duration of the intervention. Our conclusions are based on evidence of very low certainty. In addition, there is not enough adequate information on the tolerability (unpleasant but generally medically less important adverse events due to the intervention, e.g. dry mouth) and acceptability (willingness to go through with the intervention even in the presence of adverse events) of these treatments. The interventions may be unsafe, irrespective of their potential to prevent depression. 
How‐up‐to date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 6 February 2020.
