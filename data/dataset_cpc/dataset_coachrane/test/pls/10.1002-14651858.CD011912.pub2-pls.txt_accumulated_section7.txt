Pulse oximetry for diagnosis of critical congenital heart defects
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the accuracy of pulse oximetry for detection of critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in asymptomatic newborn infants. 
Background 
CCHDs occur in around two in 1000 newborn infants and are a leading cause of infant death. Timely diagnosis is crucial for best outcomes for these babies, but current screening methods may miss up to 50% of affected newborn infants before birth, and those sent home before diagnosis frequently die or endure major morbidity. However, babies with CCHD often have low blood oxygen levels, which can be detected quickly and non‐invasively by pulse oximetry, using a sensor placed on the newborn infant’s hand or foot. A pulse oximeter is a machine that can measure, non‐invasively, the amount of oxygen carried around the body by red blood cells. Oxygen from the lungs is bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin. If oxygen is not bound, de‐oxyhemoglobin is formed. In health, almost all hemoglobin is oxyhemoglobin, and so oxygen saturation (ie, the percentage of hemoglobin that has bound oxygen) is close to 100%. The pulse oximeter measures this by passing light through peripheral blood vessels (eg, a fingertip in an adult, in a hand or foot in a baby). Oxyhemoglobin and de‐oxyhemoglobin absorb this light in different ways, and the proportion of light absorbed can be analyzed by software within the oximeter, which then calculates the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. 
Study characteristics 
We searched until March 2017 for evidence on use of pulse oximetry to detect CCHD in newborn infants and found 21 studies. These studies used different thresholds to define a pulse oximetry test as positive. We combined all studies using a threshold around 95% (19 studies with 436,758 newborn infants).
