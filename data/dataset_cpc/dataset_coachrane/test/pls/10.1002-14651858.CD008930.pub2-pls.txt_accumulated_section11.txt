Is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during the postoperative period useful?
Review question 
Does continuous positive airway pressure during the postoperative period help reduce death and major lung complications after major abdominal surgery? 
Background 
General anaesthesia can lead to reduced lung volumes and collapse of the alveoli as well as to reversible, patchy collapse of areas of lung (atelectasis) and subsequent low oxygenation. These problems are worse in those patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery, in those who have predisposing factors such as obesity and chronic lung disease and in smokers. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a type of therapy that uses a high‚Äêpressure gas source to deliver constant pressure to the airways throughout both inspiration and expiration in spontaneously breathing people; oxygen is added in appropriate amounts. CPAP uses a variety of masks, which are placed over the nose or mouth. The aim of this technique is to improve the oxygenation of patients while preventing common postoperative complications in vulnerable people, especially smokers and the obese. 
This review was conducted to determine whether any difference can be found in death and major chest complications following major abdominal operations between patients treated with CPAP and those given standard care (oxygen by mask and physiotherapy). 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature until 15 September 2013. We included all adults who underwent elective major abdominal surgery. We included only studies in which the intervention was started postoperatively. 
We employed the standard methods of the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group for data collection and analysis. A total of 709 participants were included in the 10 selected trials. Considerable differences between studies were noted in the populations studied, duration of treatment and supportive care provided. 
Key results 
Two controlled trials (413 participants) reported deaths; no clear evidence showed a difference between CPAP and control groups. Six trials (249 participants) reported on atelectasis, which was reduced in the CPAP group. Pneumonia was reported in five trials (563 participants), and the rate of pneumonia was reduced in the CPAP group. The need for further respiratory support with artificial ventilation (reintubation) was reported in two studies, which favoured CPAP. No clear evidence revealed a difference between CPAP and control groups in rates of admission to intensive care units, nor were severely low oxygen levels reported.
