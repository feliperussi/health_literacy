Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
Review question 
How effective are diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years? 
Background 
Across the world, more adolescents are becoming overweight and obese. These adolescents are more likely to suffer from health problems in later life. More information is needed about what works best in treating this problem. 
Study characteristics 
We found 44 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups delivered to 4781 overweight or obese adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Our systematic review reports on the effects of multidisciplinary interventions, dietary interventions and physical activity interventions compared with a control group (no intervention, 'usual care,' enhanced usual care or some other therapy if it was also delivered to the intervention group). The adolescents in the included studies were monitored (called follow‐up) for between six months and two years. 
Key results 
The average age of adolescents ranged from 12 to 17.5 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m2). We summarised the results of 28 studies in 2774 adolescents reporting BMI, which on average was 1.18 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 20 studies in 1993 adolescents reporting weight, which on average was 3.67 kg lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. BMI reduction was maintained at 18 to 24 months of follow‐up (monitoring participants until the end of the study), which on average was 1.49 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. The interventions moderately improved health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) but we did not find firm evidence of an advantage or disadvantage of these interventions for improving self‐esteem, physical activity and food intake. No study reported on death from any cause, morbidity (illnesses) or socioeconomic effects (such as days away from school). Three studies reported no side effects, one reported no serious side effects, one did not provide details of side effects and the rest of the studies did not report whether side effects occurred or not.
