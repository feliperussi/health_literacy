Interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effect of different interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women. We found two randomised controlled trials, the highest quality of research evidence. 
Background  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are key to better outcomes. Since many women will discover a breast symptom themselves, it is important that they are breast cancer aware i.e. that they have the knowledge, skills and confidence to notice any breast changes and visit their doctor promptly. 
Study characteristics  A search for trials investigating interventions on breast cancer awareness in women was run in January 2016. We found two trials with a total of 997 women. 
The Promoting Early Presentation (PEP) study, funded by Breast Cancer UK, involved randomising 867 women to receive one of three interventions: (1) a written booklet and usual care, (2) a written booklet and usual care plus one‐to‐one discussion with a healthcare professional or (3) usual care only. Women were aged between 67 to 70 years and recruited into the study at breast cancer screening units in the UK. 
The Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS) study involved randomising 130 women into two groups that received either: (1) an educational programme using written and oral materials that focused on "breast cancer preventive behaviours" (e.g. having a healthy diet and positive beliefs towards breast self‐examining behaviour) or (2) no intervention. Women were employed at ZUMS and aged between 35 and 39 years. 
Key outcomes  Study outcomes were measured differently in the two studies. The PEP study assessed outcomes at one month, one year and two years after the intervention. The ZUMS study measured outcomes at one month after the intervention. Since the studies were very different in terms of the participants' age, interventions, outcomes and time points measured, the results are reported separately. 
Knowledge of breast cancer symptoms  In PEP: women's knowledge of breast cancer symptoms seemed to somewhat improve after receiving either the written booklet or written booklet plus verbal interaction. These results improved when compared to usual care at 2 years postintervention. In ZUMS: women’s awareness of breast cancer symptoms increased one month after the educational programme.  Knowledge of age‐related risk of breast cancer  In PEP: knowledge of age‐related risk increased for women who had received a written booklet and interacted with a healthcare professional compared to usual care at 2 years postintervention. For women who only received the booklet, there was less of a comparable increase in knowledge. In ZUMS: this study only measured if women perceived themselves to be at risk of getting breast cancer. This self‐perception of risk did increase at one month following the intervention. 
Self‐reported breast checking  In PEP: women's reported monthly breast checking increased, but not significantly, at 2 years postintervention compared to usual care. In ZUMS: women's reported "breast cancer preventive behaviours" increased one month after the intervention. Specifically, this refers to their positive beliefs towards breast self‐examining behaviour.
