Are local opinion leaders effective in promoting best practice of healthcare professionals and improving patient outcomes? 
Background 
In order to improve patient outcomes, it is important to translate evidence‐based research into practice. One way of doing this may be through the use of local opinion leaders (OLs). OLs are people who are seen as likeable, trustworthy and influential, and who through the use of different methods, e.g. community outreach visits and small group teaching, can educate healthcare professionals and persuade them to use the best available evidence. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether OLs can persuade healthcare professionals to follow evidence‐based guidelines when treating patients with the goal of improving patient health outcomes. This is an update of a systematic review published in 2011. 
Key messages 
The use of OLs probably improves the ability of healthcare professionals to follow evidence‐based guidelines, but we do not know if patient outcomes are improved. To optimise the use of OLs, we need to know more details about what they actually do and how they do it. 
What was studied in this review? 
Cochrane review authors searched for all relevant studies evaluating the effects of OLs and found 24 relevant studies. 
The healthcare professionals targeted by the OL intervention were usually physicians. The clinical condition varied across studies, with the most common being cancer. 
The main comparison was between any intervention including OLs as compared to no intervention or interventions that did not involve OLs. We also wanted to find out whether the effects of OLs would vary depending on a) the method used by researchers to identify OLs; b) the educational methods used by OLs to encourage practice change; or c) whether a single OL, or a multidisciplinary OL team delivered the intervention. 
We examined whether the intervention had an effect on healthcare professional compliance with evidence‐based practice, patient outcomes, and costs. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 24 studies, involving 337 hospitals, 350 primary care practices, 3005 healthcare professionals, and 29,167 patients (not all studies reported this information). Most studies were from North America (N = 20) and all were conducted in high‐income countries. Eighteen of the 24 studies reported the effects of healthcare professional compliance with evidence‐based practice.
