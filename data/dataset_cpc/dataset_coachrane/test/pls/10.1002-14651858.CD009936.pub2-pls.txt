Local versus general anaesthesia for adults undergoing vitrectomy surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of general anaesthesia compared to different types of local anaesthesia in vitreo‐retinal surgery (surgery involving the inner substance of the eye and the retina (the light‐sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball)). 
We did not find any eligible studies for our review.
Background 
Vitrectomy refers to the removal of the jellylike substance inside the eye. It is an approach used to treat disease of the retina including diabetic retinopathy as well as retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a process where the retina peels off the back of the eye. With the ageing global population as well as an increased frequency of diabetes, vitrectomy is becoming a more commonly performed procedure. Traditionally, this procedure has been performed with general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is a drug (given as a gas or inhaled) to bring about a reversible loss of consciousness. Local anaesthesia involves the administration of local anaesthetic to the desired area to cause a loss of sensation in a specific part of the body. There is a perception in the medical community that local anaesthesia may be slightly safer than general anaesthesia. There have so far been no good‐quality reviews addressing this issue. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the databases until July 2016 but found no suitable studies.
Key results 
This review did not find any relevant clinical evidence in the form of prospective randomized trials to determine which type of anaesthesia may be better for adults undergoing this procedure. It is important to conduct well‐designed studies in the future which could help us to decide the answer to this question. 
Quality of evidence 
We did not analyse the quality of evidence as we did not find any suitable studies to include in our review.
