Vitamins and minerals for subfertility in women
Review question:Do supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, with no treatment/standard treatment or with another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women? 'Standard treatment' includes less than 1 mg of folic acid. 
Background:Many subfertile women undergoing fertility treatment also take dietary supplements in the hope of improving their fertility. This can be a very stressful time for women and their partners. It is important that these couples are given high‐quality evidence that will allow them to make informed decisions on whether taking a supplemental antioxidant when undergoing fertility treatment will improve their chances or cause any adverse effects. This is especially important, as most antioxidant supplements are uncontrolled by regulation. This review aimed to assess whether supplements with oral antioxidants increase a subfertile woman's chances of becoming pregnant and having a baby. 
Search date:The evidence is current to September 2019. 
Study characteristics:The review includes 63 randomised controlled trials that compare antioxidants with placebo or with no treatment/standard treatment, or with another antioxidant, in a total of 7760 women. 
Funding sources:Funding sources were reported by only 27 of the 63 included trials. 
Key results:We are uncertain whether the use of antioxidants will increase live births, as the evidence was of very low quality. Based on our results, we would expect that out of 100 subfertile women not taking antioxidants, 20 would have a baby, compared with between 24 and 36 women per 100 who would have a baby if taking antioxidants. Low‐quality evidence suggests that antioxidants may be associated with increased clinical pregnancy rates. Adverse effects were poorly reported, but the use of antioxidants did not appear to lead to more miscarriages, multiple births, digestive effects or ectopic pregnancies. 
Low‐quality evidence suggests that there is no difference in live birth or clinical pregnancy rates when comparing a lower dose of melatonin to a higher dose. Here we would expect that out of 100 subfertile women taking low‐dose melatonin, 24 would have a baby, compared with between 12 and 40 women per 100 who would have a baby if taking higher‐dose melatonin. 
Three trials reported on miscarriage in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison (two used doses of melatonin and one compared N‐acetylcysteine versus L‐carnitine). There were no miscarriages in either melatonin trial. Multiple pregnancy and gastrointestinal disturbances were not reported, and ectopic pregnancy was reported by only one trial, with no events. 
The study comparing N‐acetylcysteine with L‐carnitine did not report live birth rate. Very low‐quality evidence shows no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy. Low quality evidence shows no difference in miscarriage. The study did not report multiple pregnancy, gastrointestinal disturbances or ectopic pregnancy. 
Quality of the evidence:The overall quality of evidence was limited by serious risks of bias associated with poor reporting of methods, imprecision and inconsistency.
