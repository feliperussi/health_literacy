Dressings for the prevention of surgical site infection
Review question 
This review aimed to assess whether use of different wound dressings (or leaving a wound exposed without a dressing) has an impact on the number of people who get wound infections following surgery where the wound is closed with stitches, staples, clips or glue. We also investigated whether different dressings resulted in less pain, less scarring or were more acceptable to patients and health professionals. 
Background 
Millions of surgical procedures are conducted globally each year. The majority of procedures result in wounds in which the edges are brought together to heal using stitches, staples, clips or glue; this is called 'healing by primary intention'. Afterwards, wounds are often covered with a dressing that acts as a barrier between it and the outside environment. One possible advantage of a dressing may be to protect the wound from infection (surgical site infection). Many different dressing types are available for use on surgical wounds. However, it is not clear whether one type of dressing is better than any other in preventing surgical site infection, or, indeed, whether it is better not to use a dressing at all. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted a review of all available, relevant evidence about the impact of dressings on the prevention of surgical site infections in surgical wounds healing by primary intention. This review examined data from 29 randomised controlled trials (which provide the most reliable evidence). These investigated the use of dressings in surgery that had a low risk of surgical site infection (clean surgery) and surgery with a higher risk (potentially contaminated surgery). 
Key results 
We found no clear evidence to suggest that one dressing type was better than any other at reducing the risk of surgical site infection, nor that covering wounds with any dressing at all reduced the risk of surgical site infection. Additionally, there was no clear evidence that any dressing type improves scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of removal. Currently decision makers may opt to make decisions about whether and how to dress a wound based on patient and clinician preferences and dressing costs. 
Certainty of the evidence 
It is important to note that many trials in this review were small and the evidence was of low or very low certainty meaning that current information is uncertain.
