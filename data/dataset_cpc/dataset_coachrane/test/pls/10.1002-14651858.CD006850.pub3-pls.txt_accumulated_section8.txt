Braces for idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of bracing on pulmonary disorders (lung diseases), disability, back pain, quality of life, and psychological and cosmetic issues in adolescent with idiopathic scoliosis. We found seven studies. We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective controlled cohort studies (CCTs). 
Background 
Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is curved in three dimensions (from the back the spine appears to be shaped like an 's' and the trunk is deformed). It is often idiopathic, which means the cause is unknown. The most common type of scoliosis is generally discovered around 10 years of age or older, and is defined as a curve that measures at least 10° (called a Cobb angle; measured on x‐ray). Because of the unknown cause and the age of diagnosis, it is called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). 
While there are usually no symptoms, the appearance of AIS frequently has a negative impact on adolescents. Increased curvature of the spine can present health risks in adulthood and in older people. Braces are one intervention that may stop further progression of the curve. They generally need to be worn full time, with treatment lasting until the end of growth (most frequently, from a minimum of two to four/five years). However, bracing for this condition is still controversial, and questions remain about how effective it is. 
Study characteristics 
This review included seven studies, with a total of 662 adolescents of both genders. AIS from 15° to more than 45° curves were considered. Elastic, rigid (polyethylene), and very rigid (polycarbonate) braces were studied. The evidence is current to October 2013. Funding sources were not reported or external governmental or scientific agencies.
