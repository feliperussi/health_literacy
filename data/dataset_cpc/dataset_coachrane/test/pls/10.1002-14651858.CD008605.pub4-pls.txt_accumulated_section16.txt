Can dopamine agonists prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing fertility treatment with IVF or ICSI? 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether dopamine agonists are effective and safe for preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women at high risk of OHSS (e.g. women with polycystic ovaries or a high number of eggs following ovarian stimulation) undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). How effective are these medicines compared to other types of medicines or withholding ovarian stimulation for a few days (called coasting))? 
Background 
IVF (eggs and sperm are mixed in a laboratory and the resulting embryo inserted into the womb) or ICSI (an IVF procedure where a single sperm cell is injected directly into an egg in a laboratory and the resulting embryo inserted into the womb) are treatments for infertility. To do these, the ovaries (female reproductive organs) are stimulated to produce more eggs by giving women a hormone medication. OHSS is a complication of the stimulation of the ovaries in IVF or ICSI treatment where too many eggs develop, the ovaries swell up, and fluid leaks into other parts of the body, resulting in bloating of the stomach, blood clots, and a reduction in blood and oxygen to important organs. In most cases, the condition is mild and resolves without treatment, but some women develop a moderate or severe form of OHSS that requires hospitalisation. There is no cure for OHSS other than waiting for it to settle down and managing the symptoms until they disappear. 
Dopamine agonists are a medicine that could prevent the leaking of fluid from the blood vessels to other parts of the body, which is a major problem in OHSS. 
Several treatments have been suggested to prevent OHSS. For example, coasting, or medications that keep fluid in the blood vessels (dopamine agonists, human albumin, hydroxyethyl starch, calcium, or diosmin) or support organ function (prednisolone). 
What we found 
We found 22 randomised controlled trials (a type of study that gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment) involving 3171 women at high risk of OHSS that evaluated three dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine, and quinagolide). Six studies are new in this update. The main outcome measures were the number of new cases (incidence) of moderate or severe OHSS and live birth rate. The evidence is current to 4 May 2020. 
Key results 
Dopamine agonists versus placebo/no treatment 
Dopamine agonists appear to reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS in women at high risk of OHSS compared with placebo (a pretend treatment) or no treatment. This suggests that of every 100 women having IVF or ICSI, 27 women taking placebo or no treatment will have moderate or severe OHSS, compared to eight to 14 women taking dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists may improve pregnancy outcomes, but we remain uncertain if it might increase mild side effects, such as stomach upsets, feeling sick, or dizziness. We are uncertain of the effect of dopamine agonists on pregnancy outcomes, as, pregnancy data were scarcely reported. 
Dopamine agonist plus another treatment versus another treatment 
Taking dopamine agonists combined with another active treatment may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS compared to women taking another active treatment alone. This means that of 100 women having treatment with another active treatment alone for OHSS, 11 women will have moderate or severe OHSS compared to three to nine women using dopamine agonists plus another active treatment. We remain uncertain if dopamine combined with another treatment improves pregnancy outcomes and side effects. 
Dopamine agonist versus another treatment 
We are uncertain whether the dopamine agonist cabergoline decreases OHSS rates compared to other active treatments (e.g. hydroxyethyl starch, prednisolone, calcium infusion or coasting). We are uncertain whether cabergoline improves pregnancy outcomes compared with other interventions. There were no side effects in the only study for this comparison.
