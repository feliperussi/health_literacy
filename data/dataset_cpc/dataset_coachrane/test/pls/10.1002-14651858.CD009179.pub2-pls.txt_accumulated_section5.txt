Opioids for abdominal pain in acute pancreatitis
The pancreas is a gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It produces digestive juices, amylase, secreted into the small intestine and releases hormones, insulin and glucagon, into the bloodstream. Acute pancreatitis refers to a sudden inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive juices become active inside the pancreas, causing swelling, bleeding and damage to the pancreas and its blood vessels. It is a serious condition and can lead to further problems. Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment is usually a few days in hospital for fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain, delivered by drip. 
If there is severe pain, at least one type of pain relief (e.g. paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, opioids) is generally used. Opioids, such as morphine and its derivatives, are commonly used, but without firm evidence for their effectiveness and safety. It is possible that they may hide the resolution of the disease, and may increase pain by causing spasms. The aim of this review is to clarify the appropriate use of opioids for abdominal pain in acute pancreatitis. 
We searched a number of electronic databases up to June 2013. We include five randomised clinical trials (RCTs), with a total of 227 participants in this review. The opioids evaluated were buprenorphine, pethidine, pentazocine, fentanyl and morphine. 
For participants needing additional pain relief, combined analysis of opioids (pentazocine and morphine) showed a significant benefit when compared with non‐opioid treatments. Two trials showed that buprenorphine and pentazocine were each more effective than procaine. Our confidence in the stability of these effects is low, however, due to limitations in the number of studies and participants, and the low quality of the way the trials were run and reported. No serious or life‐threatening adverse events were linked to the drugs being studied. One death was reported, in a procaine group, across all the included trials.
