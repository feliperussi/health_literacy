Iron treatment for adults and children with reduced kidney function
What is the issue? 
Anaemia (reduction in the number of circulating red blood cells) often occurs in people who have kidney damage, especially those who need dialysis treatment. Anaemia can cause tiredness, reduce exercise tolerance and increase heart size. A common cause of anaemia is reduced production of a hormone, erythropoietin. Iron deficiency can make anaemia worse, and reduce the response to medications that stimulate erythropoietin production. Iron can be taken orally (by mouth) or injected intravenously (via a vein). Intravenous (IV) iron is given under supervision in hospitals. There is uncertainty about whether IV iron should be used rather than oral iron. 
What did we do? 
We reviewed 39 studies (3852 participants) which compared IV iron supplements with oral iron in participants with chronic kidney disease. 
What did we find? 
We found that IV iron may increase blood levels of haemoglobin and iron compared with oral iron. However, IV iron may increase the number of allergic reactions though it may reduce side effects such as constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting seen with oral iron. We did not find sufficient evidence to determine whether IV iron compared with oral iron improved quality of life, altered overall death rate or death due to heart disease. 
Conclusions 
Although the results suggest that IV iron compared with oral iron may be more effective in raising iron and haemoglobin levels, we found insufficient data to determine if the benefits of IV iron are justified by improved quality of life or mortality despite the small risk of potentially serious allergic effects in some patients given IV iron.
