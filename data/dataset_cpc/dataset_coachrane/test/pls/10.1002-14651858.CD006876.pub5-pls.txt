Electromechanical‐assisted training for improving arm function and disability after stroke 
Review question 
To assess the effects of electromechanical and robot‐assisted arm training for improving arm function in people who have had a stroke. 
Background 
More than two‐thirds of people who have had a stroke have difficulties with reduced arm function, which can restrict a person's ability to perform everyday activities, reduce productivity, limit social activities, and lead to economic burden. Electromechanical and robot‐assisted arm training uses specialised machines to assist rehabilitation in supporting shoulder, elbow, or hand movements. However, the role of electromechanical and robot‐assisted arm training for improving arm function after stroke is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 45 trials (involving 1619 participants) up to January 2018 and included them in our review. Twenty‐four different electromechanical devices were described in the trials, which compared electromechanical and robot‐assisted arm training with a variety of other interventions. Participants were between 21 to 80 years of age, the duration of the trials ranged from two to 12 weeks, the size of the trials was between eight and 127 participants, and the primary outcome (activities of daily living: the most important target variable measured) differed between the included trials. 
Key results 
Electromechanical and robot‐assisted arm training improved activities of daily living in people after stroke, and function and muscle strength of the affected arm. As adverse events, such as injuries and pain, were seldom described, these devices can be applied as a rehabilitation tool, but we still do not know when or how often they should be used. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was high.
