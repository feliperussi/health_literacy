The use of epinephrine (adrenaline) in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn 
Review question: Does epinephrine reduce the duration of oxygen therapy and the need for respiratory support in newborns with transient tachypnea? 
Background: Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing); it typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn is usually improves without treatment, it is associated with wheezing syndromes in late childhood. The idea behind using epinephrine for transient tachypnea of the newborn is based on studies showing that medicines called β‐agonists, such as epinephrine, can accelerate the rate of clearance of fluid from small cavities within the lungs called alveoli. This review reported and critically analyzed the available evidence on the effectiveness of epinephrine in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics: In medical literature searches complete to March 2016, we identified and included one trial with 20 newborns comparing epinephrine with placebo. 
Results: Epinephrine did not reduce the duration of treatment with oxygen, the need for respiratory support or any other relevant measurements in newborns with transient tachypnea. 
Conclusions: Due to the small number of newborns included in the one included trial, this review did not find either a benefit or a detrimental effect of epinephrine and did not provide a definitive answer to the review question.
