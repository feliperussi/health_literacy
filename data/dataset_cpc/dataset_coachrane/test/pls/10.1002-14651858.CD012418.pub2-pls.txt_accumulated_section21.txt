Communication skills interventions for medical students
What are the best ways to teach medical students how to talk to patients? 
Teaching interpersonal skills 
We use interpersonal skills every day when we talk and interact with other people. Interpersonal skills include communication skills such as listening, speaking, and asking questions. Good communication between doctor and patient is vital for all medical consultations. Doctors need to build relationships, show empathy, gather information, explain concepts, and plan treatment with their patients. 
Medical students need to prove they are competent in interpersonal and communication skills before they graduate. Approaches to teaching medical students these skills include face‐to‐face teaching, online courses, programmes that give students personalised or tailored feedback, and use of role‐play with peers or with actors playing the role of the patient. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Medical schools and universities around the world use different approaches to teach interpersonal and communication skills. We wanted to find out which types of educational programmes work best. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills to medical students. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to September 2020. 
What we found 
We found 90 relevant studies involving 10,124 students, conducted in the USA and in countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. These studies assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills, including individual role‐play and feedback, and large group demonstrations. Programmes were delivered by face‐to‐face teaching, by video, or online. In most studies, results were assessed immediately after the educational programme concluded, and up to 12 months later. 
We compared the results of studies conducted to find out how the different programmes affected: 
· overall communication skills;
· understanding of what another person is feeling (empathy);
· relationship building or understanding one another's feelings or ideas (rapport);
· gathering of information, including patients' satisfaction, understanding, or views; and 
· explaining and planning (giving of information).
What are the main results of our review? 
Comparing interpersonal programmes against the usual educational programmes or being on a waiting list for an interpersonal programme showed that these programmes: 
· may slightly improve students' overall communication skills (evidence from 18 studies, with 1356 students) and empathy (6 studies; 831 students);
