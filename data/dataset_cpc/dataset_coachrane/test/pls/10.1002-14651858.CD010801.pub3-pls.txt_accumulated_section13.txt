Transfusion of red blood cells stored for a shorter duration versus red blood cells stored for a longer duration for all conditions 
Review question 
In people needing a blood transfusion, is it better to give blood that has been stored for a shorter time compared to a longer time? 
Background 
After donation, red blood cells (blood) can be stored for up to 42 days before being transfused to a person in need of a blood transfusion. It is not known whether blood stored for this long might be harmful, particularly in vulnerable patient groups, such as those needing intensive care. 
Study characteristics 
We investigated the consequences of giving transfusions of:
‐ blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a longer duration, and
‐ blood stored for a shorter duration versus blood stored for a standard length of time ('standard practice storage duration'; this period varies between hospitals) 
to anyone needing a blood transfusion.
We searched the medical literature to 20 November 2017. We identified 22 studies, which included a range of 42,835 participants (newborn babies less than 4 weeks old (neonates), children, and adults). Eleven studies (2249 participants) compared transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus transfusion of blood stored for a longer duration, and the other 11 studies (40,588 participants) compared transfusion of blood stored for a shorter duration versus transfusion of standard practice storage duration blood. 
Quality of evidence 
We assessed the quality of evidence for our results, which ranged from very low to moderate quality. These judgements are based on the number of trials and participants contributing data to each result, how similar the results were between trials, and the reliability of the trial methods used. Future research is highly likely to change the findings of results judged to be of very low quality, but is less likely to change the findings of other results, such as risk of death, for which we rated the evidence as moderate.
