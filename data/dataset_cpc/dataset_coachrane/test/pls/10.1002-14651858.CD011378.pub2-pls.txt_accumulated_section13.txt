Dietary supplements for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out whether nutritional supplements or special diets are effective in treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) to answer this question and found nine studies for inclusion. RCTs are medical studies where the treatment or care people receive is are chosen at random. This type of trial provides the most reliable health evidence about whether different approaches to treatment or care make a difference. 
Key messages 
Of the nine studies that we identified, eight reported the outcomes we were interested in, primarily impact on ulcer healing. Findings from five studies showed very low‐certainty evidence regarding the effect of oral nutritional supplements in tablet form on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. These five studies did not measure healing in such a way that we could be certain of the results, and they did not have enough participants for us to be certain of the effects. The results of three other studies also showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplements in other forms have any impact on ulcer healing. Two of these studies showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplement drinks have any impact on other outcomes such as death, likelihood of amputation, reduction in numbers of new ulcers, or people's quality of life. These studies were not well conducted and did not have enough participants involved for us to be certain of the effects. 
What was studied in the review? 
People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers. These are often due to reduced blood supply, reduced sensation, foot deformity, the presence of trauma, or a combination of all or some of these causes. Foot ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes and can result in serious consequences such as amputation. 
It is thought that foot ulcers, like other wounds, heal better, and more quickly, if people are well‐nourished. Food supplements containing certain vitamins and protein can be given to people with foot ulcers and diabetes to help to treat their wounds. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found nine relevant studies dating from 2004 to 2019, involving 629 participants, 72% were men, aged, on average, 59.2 years. Most studies took place in hospital outpatient clinics. Three studies explored a different nutritional supplement drink and compared this with a drink that looked the same but did not have any added nutritional supplement. Five studies explored the effects of different types of nutritional tablets and compared these with tablets that did not contain any active ingredient, or nutritional supplement. One study compared two different doses of a vitamin D injection. One study did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Two of the studies were sponsored by the manufacturers of the nutritional supplement, five studies were sponsored by Iranian university research funding. 
Findings from eight studies are unclear as to whether nutritional interventions improve the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation. One study reported adverse events and two studies reported numbers of amputations. Results are unclear as to whether there is a difference in the numbers of amputations or deaths between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. It is also unclear if there is a difference in health‐related quality of life or number of ulcers that recur between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. 
Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. None of the studies had enough participants, five did not measure outcomes in such a way that we could be certain of the results and the studies were not well conducted, so we are not very confident in the results. Additional studies at low risk of bias and of high‐certainty evidence are needed to clarify the role of nutritional interventions for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.
