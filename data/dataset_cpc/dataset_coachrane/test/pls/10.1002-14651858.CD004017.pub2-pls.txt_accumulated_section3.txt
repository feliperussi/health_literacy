Physical activity programs for older adults
To improve health, is it better to do an exercise programme at home or at a hospital center?  To answer this question scientists from the Cochrane Group found and analyzed 6 studies. These studies tested over 370 people over 50 years old who had heart disease (or high risk of heart disease), Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COPD). The studies compared people who did an exercise programme at home to those who did an exercise programme at a hospital or center up to 2 years. This review provides the best evidence we have today. 
What is the difference between exercise programmes at home or at a center? Why research whether one is better than the other?  Active living benefits the health of people 50 years and older. One of the important benefits is being able to do your everyday activities better and walking better (physical function). There are many ways to increase activity. You can do an exercise programme at home on your own, at your own convenience and at maybe a cost to you, but no cost to the health care system. Or you can join a programme at a center or hospital run by trained health care professionals. Most times these programmes are covered and do not cost you anything but they do cost the health care system. It is therefore important to know which type of programme improves health more, which programme people will stick with in the long run and which programme is worth the cost.
