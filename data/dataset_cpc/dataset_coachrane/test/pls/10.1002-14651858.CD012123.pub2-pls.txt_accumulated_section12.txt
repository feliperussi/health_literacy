N‐acetylcysteine for acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol overdose
Background 
Acute liver failure is a condition where previously healthy liver cells are severely damaged. This damage results in loss of important liver functions, which include clearing the body of wastes and toxins and producing proteins to help blood clot. People with acute liver failure are at high risk of death. The most common cause of acute liver failure is ingesting too much paracetamol (acetaminophen). Other reasons for acute liver failures include viral infections (e.g. hepatitis), drug‐related liver injury, the body's immune system attacking the liver, or lack of liver blood flow. 
For acute liver failure that is caused by ingesting too much paracetamol, N‐acetylcysteine is a treatment that seems to work well and is the standard treatment for people who ingested too much paracetamol. For all other causes of acute liver failure, transplanting a liver is the usual accepted treatment, but it has many limitations (e.g. organ availability). Certain clinicians have started N‐acetylcysteine administration also in patients with acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol. 
Systematic review question 
We investigated the effects and safety of using N‐acetylcysteine in people with acute liver failure even when it is not related to too much paracetamol ingestion.

Trial funding sources 
The two randomised clinical trials included were both primarily funded by grants from the National Institute of Health, a US government agency. Pharmaceutical companies provided the study drug, but they did not take part in the rest of the study. 
Key results 
The review authors looked for all studies of N‐acetylcysteine in people with acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol to determine whether this treatment reduced the chance of dying or needing a liver transplant. Two randomised clinical trials were eligible to be included: one in adults and one in children. Both studies compared N‐acetylcysteine to placebo. The review authors found one additional study, but are waiting for more information so this study was not included. Because the randomised clinical trials were so different, it would be inappropriate to combine the data. When review authors analysed the randomised clinical trials individually, they found that N‐acetylcysteine did not improve survival nor did it lower the number of liver transplants. The current randomised clinical trials do not support the use of N‐acetylcysteine in people with acute liver failure who do not have paracetamol overdose.
