Life skills programmes for chronic mental illnesses
Having a mental health problem can cause difficulties and obstacles in all areas of life, even those as simple as washing, shopping, talking openly with other people, brushing teeth, cleaning the house, managing money, making friends, shaving and being independent. Having a mental health problem, combined with the sleep‐like haze of many antipsychotic medications, limits people’s ability to look after themselves, socialise with other people, take part in education or career development and find work.  
Life skills programmes attempt to remedy some of these difficulties by encouraging independent living, so enhancing quality of life. Life skills often have several components: communication and talking; financial awareness and money management; domestic tasks (such as cooking, washing‐ up dishes, hoovering, doing the laundry and running a home); and personal self‐care (such as washing, bathing, cleaning teeth, shaving, combing hair and getting dressed). Other life skills include training on coping with stress, shopping for and eating healthy food, knowing the time, taking medication, improving social skills, using transport and forward planning.   
Rehabilitation or getting better is slow, complex and difficult. There are many ways of engaging with people during this process, including: creative therapies (art, drama, music, poetry, education, dancing, singing); life skills (as described above); work‐based therapy to enhance employment; and recreational activities (such as group walks, swimming, sport, reading, writing a diary, watching television, going to parties, events and day trips).  
This review looks at different types of rehabilitation therapy for people with mental health problems. It compares life skills training with occupational therapy and peer support (where a group of people with mental health problems were encouraged to help each other). Comparison was also made with standard or usual care. Life skills, occupational therapy and peer support all aim to promote health by enabling people to perform meaningful and purposeful activities. 
In the main, the authors of the review conclude that there is no great difference between those that receive life skills, occupational therapy, peer support and standard care. It is questionable if people should be put under pressure to attend life skills and not known whether life skills are a benefit or perhaps even harmful. Professionals and service users invest much time in life skills and this may cost both time and money. However, the quality of scientific evidence is low and uncertain. The authors note that life skills are still a simple and easy way that has the potential to make great benefits for people who are almost disabled by mental health problems.
