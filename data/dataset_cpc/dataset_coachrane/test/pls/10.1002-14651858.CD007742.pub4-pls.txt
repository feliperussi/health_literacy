Interventions for an acute internal hordeolum
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane review was to investigate whether treatments such as warm compresses, over‐the‐counter topical medications and lid scrubs, antibiotics, steroids, and lid massages were useful treatments for an internal hordeolum (a swelling that develops on the inside of the eyelid). Cochrane researchers searched for all relevant studies to answer this question and found no studies. 
Key messages  Many common treatments are available to treat an internal hordeolum. At present, there is no evidence to show whether any of these treatments work. 
What was studied in this review?  A hordeolum is a common, painful lump in the eyelid that is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The infection affects the oil glands in the eyelid and results in a lump. Often, the infected lump drains and heals by itself, with no treatment. However, the infection can sometimes spread to other glands in the eyes, and can become long lasting. It can also turn into a cyst (known as a chalazion). Hordeola can be internal (on the inside of the eyelid), or external (on the outside of the eyelid near the eyelashes). A hordeolum on the outside of the eyelid is known as a stye. Hordeola can also be acute (appearing suddenly and healing in a short time), or chronic (long lasting). Common treatments for hordeola include warm compresses applied at home, topical medications and lid scrubs available over‐the‐counter, prescribed antibiotics or steroids, and lid massages. 
What are the main results of the review?  Cochrane researchers looked for studies of people with an acute internal hordeolum. They did not look for studies of people with styes or long‐lasting hordeola. They found no relevant studies that had compared treatments. Thus, no evidence was found for or against using any of the common treatments for hordeola. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 2 December 2016.
