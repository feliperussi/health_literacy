Thirty‐three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co‐administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e. diosmectite or infant formula) or no treatment. The studies were short‐term, ranging in length from 5 days to 12 weeks. Analyses showed that probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate reduction (11% fewer will suffer diarrhea). For every 9 children treated, probiotics will prevent one case of diarrhea. Further, evidence suggests that higher dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) reduce the incidence of AAD. Eight per cent (162/2029) of the high dose probiotics group had AAD compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate to large reduction (15% fewer suffer diarrhea). Probiotics were generally well tolerated, and minor side effects (e.g. rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, constipation) occurred infrequently. . Evidence suggested that probiotics are effective for a moderate reduction in duration of diarrhea (almost one day). Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day appear most appropriate for preventing AAD in children receiving antibiotics. It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of 'other' probiotic agents for preventing AAD. Although no serious probiotic‐related side effects were observed among the mostly otherwise healthy children who participated in the studies, serious side effects have been reported in observational studies not included in this review, including severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter (a flexible tube used to give medicines) use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation (the passage of bacteria from the gut to other areas of the body).
