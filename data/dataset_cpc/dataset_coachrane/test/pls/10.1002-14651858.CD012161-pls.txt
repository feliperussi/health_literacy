Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues more useful than regular human insulin for adults with type 1 diabetes? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach); it controls the blood levels of glucose. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce any insulin so the person has to inject insulin to control their glucose levels and keep well. Short‐acting insulin analogues (such as insulin lispro, insulin aspart and insulin glulisine) act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. 
Study characteristics 
We found nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the insulin analogues, insulin lispro and insulin aspart, to regular human insulin delivered to 2693 participants. The people in the included studies were monitored (called follow‐up) for between 24 and 52 weeks. 
This evidence is up‐to‐date as of 15 April 2015.
Key results 
According to our analysis, short‐acting insulin analogues were slightly better than regular human insulin regarding long‐term glycaemic control (where blood glucose is at controlled levels) and showed similar episodes of low blood sugar (called hypoglycaemia), especially with regard to severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia. We found no information on late diabetes complications such as problems with the eyes, kidneys or feet. The studies did not report costs and they were too short to investigate death from any cause reliably. We also found no clear evidence for a marked effect of insulin analogues on the health‐related quality of life (which is physical, mental, emotional and social health). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was low or very low, mainly because none of the studies was carried out in a blinded way (where healthcare professionals and participants do not know which treatment they received) so that risk of bias, especially for outcomes such as hypoglycaemic episodes, was present in all of the studies. Furthermore, several studies showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results.
