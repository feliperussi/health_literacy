Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes.
