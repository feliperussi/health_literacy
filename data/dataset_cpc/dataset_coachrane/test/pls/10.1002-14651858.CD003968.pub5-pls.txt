Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents 
Bottom line 
Psychological therapies reduce pain frequency immediately following treatment for children and adolescents with chronic headache and reduce pain intensity for children and adolescents with mixed chronic pain conditions. Psychological therapies also reduce disability for children and adolescents with mixed chronic pain conditions immediately following treatment and up to 12 months later, and for children with headache conditions up to 12 months later. 
Background 
Chronic pain or pain that lasts for longer than three months is common in young people. Psychological therapies (e.g. relaxation, hypnosis, coping skills training, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy) may help people manage pain and its disabling consequences. Therapies can be delivered face‐to‐face by a therapist, via the Internet, by telephone call, or by computer programme. This review focused on treatments that are delivered face‐to‐face by a therapist, which includes therapies delivered by telephone or via a book with exercise instructions. For children and adolescents, there is evidence that relaxation by itself and cognitive behavioural therapy (treatment that helps people test and revise their thoughts and actions) are effective in reducing the intensity of pain in chronic headache, recurrent abdominal pain, fibromyalgia, and sickle cell disease immediately after treatment. 
Study Characteristics 
This review included 47 studies with 2884 participants. The average age of the children and adolescents was 12.6 years. Most studies included young people with headache (23 studies) or stomach pain (10 studies), The remaining studies investigated children with irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or included samples with various chronic pain conditions. 
Key results 
Psychological therapies reduced pain frequency immediately following treatment for children and adolescents with chronic headache, and pain intensity and anxiety for children and adolescents with other chronic pain conditions. Psychological therapies also reduced disability for children and adolescents with non‐headache chronic pain conditions immediately following treatment and for children with headache and mixed chronic pain conditions up to 12 months later. We did not find any benefit of psychological treatments on reducing anxiety for children with headache or for depression in children with headache or mixed chronic pain conditions. 
Quality of evidence 
We judged all outcomes to be low or very low‐quality, meaning our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect or we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; or the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.
