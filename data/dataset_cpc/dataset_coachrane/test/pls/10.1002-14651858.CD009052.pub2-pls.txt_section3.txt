We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 8 to 209. The comparisons included various drugs that affect the blood clotting (congealing) such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid; blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood); use of thromboelastography (a bedside measure of blood clot formation); and lowering the pressure in the veins with an aim to decrease the blood loss from veins. We found no significant difference in the risk of death or graft loss, or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There does not appear to be any consistency in the results between blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, low central venous pressure, and thromboelastography may lower blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, these findings are based on few trials with a high risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefits) and high risk of play of chance (random error due to small number of patients). There were no differences in the hospital stay or intensive care unit stay in any of the comparisons. Nor was there any significant difference in the intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the compared groups. Again, most of the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance).
