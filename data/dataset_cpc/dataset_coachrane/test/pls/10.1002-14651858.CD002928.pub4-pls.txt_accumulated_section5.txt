Do interventions to enhance one‐to‐one support provided by partners, family members, or 'buddies' help smokers quit? 
Background 
Smokers are more likely to quit when others in their social circle quit. They are also more likely to be successful when they receive active support to quit. Life partners, family members, friends, and others are all viable sources of support. This review investigated whether interventions designed to train or guide individuals to provide support to smokers trying to quit helped more smokers to quit than stop‐smoking programmes without a partner‐support element. 
Study characteristics 
This is an update of previous reviews. We searched for studies published up to April 2018, and found three new studies that we could include, giving a total of 14 studies with 3370 participants. Studies had to be randomised controlled trials that recruited smokers trying to quit, and measured whether participants had quit smoking at least six months after the beginning of the study. The study had to include at least one group who were part of a stop‐smoking programme to increase partner support, and at least one group who received a comparable stop‐smoking programme without partner support. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA. At recruitment the average amount participants smoked was between 13 to 29 cigarettes a day across studies. The smoking status of partners providing support varied, but most were non‐smokers. Intervention techniques ranged from low to high intensity; in some cases help was by a self‐help booklet and in other cases by face‐to‐face counselling. In some studies researchers did not make direct contact with 'partners' and the smokers themselves were encouraged to find a 'buddy', but in other studies both the smoker and their 'buddy' received face‐to‐face support.
