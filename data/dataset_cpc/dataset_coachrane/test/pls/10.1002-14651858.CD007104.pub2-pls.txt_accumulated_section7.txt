Does giving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both improve survival in people with rare (anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas) brain tumours? 
Background 
Traditionally, the standard of care for people with rare anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (brain tumours) has been surgery followed by radiotherapy. However, the benefit of adjuvant (post‚Äêsurgery) chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still unclear. In addition, the value of chromosome markers is also under investigation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the scientific literature up to March 2014 for studies of adults over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic oligoastrocytomas or anaplastic astrocytomas. After surgery, the participants had to have received radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. In the first review on this topic in 2009, we found two trials to include. In this update, we identified another trial for inclusion, and updates from the two previously included trials were taken into consideration. 
Key results 
Three randomized controlled trials, which included 931 participants, assessed the role of chemotherapy alone or in addition to radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone. One study was able to demonstrate a significant survival benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery, compared with radiotherapy alone. In addition, during examination of these brain tumour biopsy specimens, they found specific chromosome deletions and mutations in two studies, which helped to identify a group of participants with better survival outcomes. Furthermore, in one study, these specific chromosome deletions and mutations predicted which group of participants derived benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery.
