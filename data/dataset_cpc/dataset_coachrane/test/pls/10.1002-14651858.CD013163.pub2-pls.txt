Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants.
