A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The active cycle of breathing technique uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review.

Study characteristics 
While 19 studies comparing the active cycle of breathing technique with other airway clearance therapies are included in the review, only five studies (192 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the five studies compared different techniques: the active cycle of breathing technique was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high‐frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, and conventional chest physiotherapy. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (63%) were male. 
Key results 
We found that the active cycle of breathing technique was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference. 
Quality of the evidence 
Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross‐over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review. 
All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self‐reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function. 
Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups.
