Pregabalin for decreasing abdominal pain in people with chronic pancreatitis
Review question 
Is pregabalin useful in decreasing abdominal pain in people with chronic pancreatitis?
Background 
The pancreas is an abdominal organ that secretes several digestive enzymes into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also comprises the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones, including insulin. Chronic pancreatitis is long‐standing and progressive inflammation of the pancreas resulting in destruction and replacement of pancreatic tissue with fibrous tissue. This may lead to a shortage of digestive enzymes and insulin (helps regulate blood sugar), leading to diabetes (a lifelong condition in which a person's blood sugar level becomes too high). Alcohol is considered the main cause but others include: smoking, some drugs, and a variety of other disorders. Chronic abdominal pain is the major symptom of chronic pancreatitis. The pain is usually in the upper abdomen and is usually described as deep, penetrating, and radiating to the back. Various theories exist about the reason for pain in chronic pancreatitis. One theory is that the disease process affects the nerves supplying the pancreas. Pregabalin inhibits the transmission of pain through the nerves. Pregabalin may decrease pain in people with chronic pancreatitis, but may also produce a number of side‐effects. Some common side‐effects include: excessive sleepiness, blurred vision, double vision, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting, excessive wind, feeling excited, confusion, reduced sexual desire, irritability, feeling dizzy, feeling unsteady, tremors, speech difficulty, tingling or pricking ('pins and needles') sensation, and disturbances of attention and memory. Less frequent, but serious adverse events include: fainting episodes, heart failure, and reversible kidney failure. This review included all studies 22 June 2015, on the benefits and harms of using pregabalin to treat chronic pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. 
Study characteristics 
We only found one study funded by Pfizer that met our inclusion criteria. A total of 64 participants with chronic pain due to chronic pancreatitis received either increasing doses of pregabalin (150 mg per day to 600 mg per day; 34 participants) or matching placebo (sham treatment; 30 participants) on an outpatient basis. The decision about whether a participant received pregabalin or placebo was made using methods similar to toss of a coin, to ensure that the participants in the two groups were similar. Participants received pregabalin or placebo for three weeks, then the outcomes were measured. Potential participants taking other pain‐killers were allowed to take part in the study. Thus, this trial evaluates the role of pregabalin in addition to other analgesics for decreasing chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis. 
Key results 
Only the short‐term outcomes were available in this trial. This trial found that the changes in opiate use (drugs similar to morphine), and pain scores from baseline were better in participants taking pregabalin compared to those taking placebo. It was not clear whether these changes had a significant impact on the life of the participants.This trial also found that there were more side‐effects in participants taking pregabalin compared to those taking placebo. The differences between pregabalin and placebo were imprecise for short‐term health‐related quality of life, percentage of people with serious side‐effects, and percentage of people requiring hospital admissions.
