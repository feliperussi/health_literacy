Psychological treatments to help individuals with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers manage the disease 
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that damages many of the body's organs and can shorten a person's life span. The disease is progressive, stressful to manage, and needs complex and time‐consuming treatments, leaving patients and caregivers stressed due to the challenges of the treatment. Thus, individuals with cystic fibrosis and their family members often need help to cope better and to deal with their thoughts and feelings. They also need assistance in managing the demands of the prescribed treatment schedules. In addition, infection control guidelines recommend the isolation of people with cystic fibrosis from others with the same disease, leading to a lack of peer support and potential social isolation. 
We looked for studies of psychological treatments in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their families which aimed to reduce anxiety and depression, to improve adjustment, quality of life, and even medical outcomes, as well as knowledge, skills, and decisions regarding care. The review includes 16 studies with a total of 556 participants. Even though there many different psychological interventions, only a few have been evaluated for individuals with CF and their families. Due to the lack of high quality studies, it is not possible to currently show which psychological treatments are most helpful to those with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Five out of the 16 studies we found evaluated behavioural interventions to improve dietary intake. We found that in children aged 4 to 12 years receiving a nutritional intervention plus behavioural management training, consumed about 276 calories per day more than children just receiving the nutritional intervention. We also found that a structured decision‐making tool for adults considering lung transplantation improved their knowledge, assisted in setting realistic expectations, and reduced indecision.
