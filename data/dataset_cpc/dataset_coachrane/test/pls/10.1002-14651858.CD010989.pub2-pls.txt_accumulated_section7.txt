Is surgery or observation better for people who have a severe blunt injury to the liver? 
Background 
The liver is the most commonly affected organ when a person is injured in the abdomen. Abdominal injury is usually caused by motor vehicle crashes, falling, being punched in the stomach, or from other causes. When a person is badly injured in the abdomen, they have a 10% to 15% chance of death. According to previous research, the chance of death following a liver injury has not reduced over the past 30 years. 
Liver injury is classified on a scale from 1 to 6. A grade 1 injury is least severe, whereas a grade 6 injury is most severe. The majority of people with a grade 6 injury die. Usually, people with grade 1 and 2 liver injuries receive observation as their treatment; so their body can heal naturally. People with higher grade injuries may need surgery. During surgery doctors may stitch the liver together to help it heal. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether surgery or observation is better for people who have a severe blunt liver injury. Studies were included if people had a liver injury of grade 3, 4 or 5. We were interested in finding out if there is a difference in death, illness, or quality of life. 
We searched for every randomised controlled trial undertaken worldwide, of surgery or observation for people with grade 3, 4 or 5 liver injury. We searched for trials on 14 April 2014.
