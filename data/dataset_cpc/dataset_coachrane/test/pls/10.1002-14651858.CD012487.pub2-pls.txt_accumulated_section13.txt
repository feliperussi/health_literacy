Workplace interventions for increasing standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers 
Why is it important to increase standing or walking at work? 
The number of people working in sedentary jobs has increased in recent decades. Many of these people complain of musculoskeletal symptoms. Walking or standing interventions at work have been effective in reducing sitting time at work. However, it is still unclear if these interventions are effective in reducing the intensity or presence of musculoskeletal symptoms among office workers. 
The purpose of this review We wanted to find out the effects of interventions aimed at increasing standing or walking for decreasing musculoskeletal symptoms in sedentary workers. We searched the literature in various databases up to January 2019. 
What trials did review authors find? We found 10 studies conducted with a total of 955 employees with musculoskeletal complaints from high‐income countries. Four studies evaluated changes to the physical work environment through provision of sit‐stand or treadmill workstations, two studies evaluated individual approaches involving use of an activity tracker, and five studies used multi‐component interventions and counselling interventions. However, no studies solely targeted interventions at the organisation level. 
Effects of changes to the physical work environment 
The available evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of sit‐stand desk or treadmill workstations in reducing the intensity of low back and upper back symptoms. 
Effects of interventions targeted at the individual 
The effectiveness of an activity tracker compared to an alternative intervention or no intervention in reducing the intensity or presence of low back, upper back, neck, shoulder, and elbow/wrist and hand symptoms cannot be determined based on available evidence at short‐term follow‐up (less than six months). 
Effects of interventions targeted at the organisation 
No available studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions targeted solely at the organisational level. 
Effects of combining multiple interventions 
Available evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of combining multiple interventions in reducing the proportions of people with low back or upper back pain at short‐term follow‐up (less than six months), medium‐term follow‐up (between six and 12 months), or long‐term follow‐up (12 months or longer).
