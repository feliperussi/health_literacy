Stiripentol as an add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is one of the more common chronic neurological disorders; it affects 1% of the population worldwide. A large proportion of these people (up to 30%) continue to have seizures despite adequate therapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), used singularly (as monotherapy) or in combination (polytherapy). These individuals are regarded as having drug‐resistant epilepsy. Stiripentol is an AED that was developed in France and was approved in 2007 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as add‐on therapy with valproate and clobazam for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (a rare, drug‐resistant epilepsy that begins in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant). This review appraises evidence for the use of stiripentol as add‐on treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy in individuals taking AEDs. 
Results 
On the basis of our review criteria, we included only one study in the review (32 children with focal epilepsy). This study adopted a responder‐enriched design and found no clear evidence of seizure reduction (≥ 50%) nor of seizure freedom with add‐on stiripentol compared with placebo. Add‐on stiripentol led to greater risk of adverse effects considered as a whole (risk ratio (RR) 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.47) compared with placebo. Generalisation of study results to a more widespread population is limited by the fact that only responders to stiripentol (i.e. patients experiencing a decrease in seizure frequency of at least 50% compared with baseline) were included in the randomised, add‐on, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind portion of the study. Also, the very small sample size with the correspondingly high dropout rate prevents generalisation of study results. Finally, because of the adopted design, carry‐over and withdrawal effects probably influenced outcomes related to seizure frequency.
