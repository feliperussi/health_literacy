What do we know about the impact of hospital nurse staffing on patients, staff and the costs of care? 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if changes made to nurse staffing in hospitals improve outcomes for patients or nurses, or have an impact on the cost of health care. Nurse staffing can refer to the number of nurses per patient, the mix of different types of nurses in a hospital unit, or models used to allocate nurses to patients in a hospital unit. 
Key messages 
The research relating to hospital nurse staffing is very limited and the findings should be treated with caution. 
It is unlikely that adding nurses with advanced nursing skills (Nurse Practitioners (NPs)) or with expertise in a particular area of practice (Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs)) to hospital nurse staffing makes any difference to patient death rates. We cannot be sure what other effect it might have on patients, for example, if it reduces the time patients spend in hospital or the costs of patient care. We cannot be sure if changes to the way in which nurses are allocated to patient care reduces the numbers of nurses resigning, or if introducing unqualified nurses to the nursing workforce reduces costs, as the research here is very limited too. 
What was studied in the review? 
We found studies that looked at the effects of four main strategies or models of nurse staffing: adding advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce, introducing less‐qualified nursing personnel to the nursing workforce, changing the way in which nurses are allocated within a hospital unit to provide patient care, and changing the way hospital units schedule nursing shifts. We were most interested in the impact of these interventions on seven main outcomes: nursing‐staff resignations (turnover), patient deaths, patients being readmitted following discharge from the hospital, patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) for care following discharge, the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, and the costs of care. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies where advanced or specialist nurses were added to the nursing workforce. None of the studies reported the impact of this intervention on nursing‐staff resignations; three studies found that it may make little or no difference to patient deaths. We cannot be sure whether this intervention has an effect on reducing the number of patients being readmitted following discharge from hospital or attending an ED for care after discharge because the research is very limited. As well, we are uncertain about its effect on reducing the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, or healthcare costs, again because the research is very limited. 
We found one relevant study that looked at adding nursing assistants to the nursing workforce, which was aimed at reducing costs. We cannot be sure about the effect on costs as the research is very limited. 
We found five studies of primary nursing (where one nurse is responsible for the total care of a number of patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week) and two studies of nurse‐staffing models. One nurse‐staffing model study tested hospital units scheduling their own nursing shifts (self‐staffing), and the other study compared different ways to schedule nursing shifts. We cannot be sure about the impact of primary nursing or nurse‐staffing models on nurse resignations or costs because the research is very limited.
