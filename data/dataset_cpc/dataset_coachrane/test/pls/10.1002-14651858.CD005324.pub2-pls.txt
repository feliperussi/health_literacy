Bisphosphonate therapy for children and adolescents with secondary osteoporosis.
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in children and adolescents. The review shows that bisphosphonates: 
‐ may not lead to any difference in bone mineral density (bone thickness and strength).
There was not enough information in the included studies to tell whether bisphosphonates would make a difference to children's bone mineral content (the amount and type of minerals in the bone); the number of broken bones children and adolescents had or the condition of children's vertebrae (for example, new fractures detected on an x‐ray or other scan).   We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include the acute phase reaction (fever, chills, general malaise), low levels of calcium in the body, nausea, abdominal bloating and other digestion problems, damage to the esophagus, bone or muscle pain, dizziness, rash, and memory loss.   What is osteoporosis and what are bisphosphonates?  Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall. All the bones in your body are weaker if you have osteoporosis but not everyone who has osteoporosis gets a broken bone.   To find out whether a person's bones are weaker than normal, a bone mineral density test is done using a special x‐ray, a computed tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound.  In some children with a chronic illness, osteoporosis could be caused by condition they have or because of the medications they take for their condition. This is known as secondary osteoporosis.   Bisphosphonates are a type of medication that slows down the cells that break down the old bone. This means the cells that grow new bone have a chance to catch up and strengthen the bone.
