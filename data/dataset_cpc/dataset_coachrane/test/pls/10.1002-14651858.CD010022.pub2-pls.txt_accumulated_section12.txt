Alcohol intake reduction for controlling hypertension
Review question 
We evaluated whether an intervention to reduce alcohol intake has a greater impact than other kinds of interventions (or no intervention at all) in reducing blood pressure in people with high blood pressure and alcohol consumption. 
Background 
High blood pressure is associated with an increase in the risk of heart attack, stroke and mortality. Heavy drinking increases cardiovascular risk and has been associated with heart and vascular problems. Some studies have confirmed a relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension. 
Some studies have already assessed how alcohol intake can affect blood pressure. However, it is still unclear whether interventions to reduce alcohol intake can also modify blood pressure. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to June 2020.
Study characteristics 
We included one trial with 269 participants who were followed up for 24 months. We assessed data to identify differences in blood pressure, number of deaths and serious diseases between a group of people receiving psychological assistance to reduce alcohol intake and people not receiving this assistance. 
Key results 
Based on this limited information, although those participants who received psychological assistance were able to reduce their alcohol intake more than those without such assistance, we found no differencesÂ in the number of deaths, total heart problems and total vascular problems between people receiving psychological assistance to decrease alcohol intake and those not receiving such help. We also found no differences in blood pressure reduction. Data on quality of life or serious adverse effects were not available.
