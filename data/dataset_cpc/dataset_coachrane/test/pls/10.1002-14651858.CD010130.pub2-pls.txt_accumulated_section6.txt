Use of rapid point‐of‐care testing for infection to guide doctors prescribing antibiotics for acute respiratory infections in primary care settings 
Review question  We reviewed the evidence of the effect and safety of a rapid test of infection at point‐of‐care for using antibiotics in people with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) (e.g. common colds) in primary care. 
Background  Antibiotic treatment is common in ARIs despite the fact that the vast majority are caused by viruses, against which antibiotics are ineffective and unnecessary. The concern is that antibiotics may cause side effects and are directly associated with antibiotic resistance in common bacteria, causing treatment failure and complications, including death. Antibiotics have a modest, if any, effect against the majority of ARIs. Their use must be balanced against risking higher levels of antibiotic resistance, side effects and costs. Biomarkers of infection are proteins or components of the immune system that participate in the body's acute response to infection. No tests are currently able to provide perfect diagnostic accuracy for infections. This could lead to over‐ as well as under‐diagnosis. Some tests have been developed that assess the presence of infections by looking for certain of these biomarkers. These are rapid tests that may be used during the consultation by primary care doctors when people go to see them with symptoms of an ARI. In the correct clinical context these point‐of‐care tests could assist primary care doctors by identifying people with infections that are most likely to respond to antibiotics. We looked at the evidence for these tests to assess the possible harms and benefits of implementing such a strategy in primary health care. 
Study characteristics  We included six studies with a total of 3284 participants with ARIs from primary care settings (point‐of care test: C‐reactive protein). Two of the included studies received direct financial support from manufacturers. The evidence is current to January 2014. 
Key results  The only point‐of‐care biomarker of infection currently available to primary care identified in the review was C‐reactive protein. A reduction in antibiotic use is likely to be achieved by a C‐reactive protein point‐of‐care test but due to differences in the designs of the included studies, it was not possible to obtain a precise effect estimate of the reduction. There were no deaths in the studies and we did not find evidence suggesting that time to recovery from ARIs and their duration were longer, nor that levels of patient satisfaction or number of re‐consultations were affected in the C‐reactive protein group. However, a possible increase in the risk of hospital admission cannot be ruled out. 
Quality of the evidence  We ranked the evidence as of moderate quality according to the GRADE levels due to an imprecise effect estimation.
