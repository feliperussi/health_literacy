Early palliative care for adults with advanced cancer
Review question 
What is the evidence for the effects of early palliative care on quality of life, survival, depression, and symptom intensity in people with advanced cancer? 
Background 
Frequently, cancer is diagnosed at a late stage, and the disease might have progressed through anticancer treatment. Patients can choose to start or continue anticancer treatment at the potential cost of side effects. Standard care means that all patients are offered palliative care towards the end of life. However, patients may be able to receive palliative care a lot earlier. This approach, which is known as early palliative care, begins at the time of, or shortly after, the diagnosis of advanced cancer. Often, early palliative care is combined with anticancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Early palliative care, whether provided by the attending oncologist or by specialist teams, involves empathetic communication with patients about their prognosis, advance care planning, and symptom assessment and control. 
Study characteristics 
In October 2016, we searched for clinical trials on early palliative care in adults with advanced cancer. We included seven studies and found 20 ongoing studies. Most of the studies included participants older than 65 years of age on average, diagnosed with different tumour types and receiving treatment in tertiary care centres in North America. Most of these studies compared early palliative care with standard oncological (cancer) care. All studies were funded by government agencies. 
Key results 
When evaluated together in a meta‐analysis, studies showed that in patients with advanced cancer, early palliative care may slightly increase quality of life. It may also decrease symptom intensity to a small degree. Effects on survival and depression are uncertain. A single study reported side effects (adverse events), for example, more pain and reduced appetite. For the remaining six studies, information about side effects was not published, but trial authors told us they had not observed any. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We rated the certainty of the evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Evidence of very low certainty means that we have little confidence in the results. Evidence of high certainty means that we are very confident in the results. We found that certainty of the evidence was low for health‐related quality of life and symptom intensity, and was very low for depression and survival. We downgraded certainty of the evidence for various reasons, for example, problems in the way studies were carried out, differences between studies, and the small number of studies. We remain uncertain about the effects of early palliative care; therefore we have to interpret the results with caution. When published, ongoing studies may provide more evidence, and this may affect the certainty of the results.
