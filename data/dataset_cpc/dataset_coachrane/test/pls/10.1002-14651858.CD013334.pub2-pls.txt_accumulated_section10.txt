Low‐carbohydrate diets or balanced‐carbohydrate diets: which works better for weight loss and heart disease risks?  
Key messages 
• There is probably little to no difference in the weight lost by people following low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets (also known as 'low‐carb diets') compared to the weight lost by people following balanced‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets, for up to two years. 
• Similarly, there is probably little to no difference between the diets for changes in heart disease risks, like diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c, a measure of blood sugar levels over 2‐3 months) and LDL cholesterol (‘unhealthy’ cholesterol) up to two years. 
• This was the case in people with and without type 2 diabetes.
What are low‐carbohydrate and balanced‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets? 
People spend lots of money on trying to lose weight using diets, products, foods and books, and continue to debate about which diets are effective and safe. So, examining the scientific evidence behind claims made is important. Low‐carbohydrate diets are a broad category of weight‐reducing diets that manipulate and restrict carbohydrates, protein and fat in diets. There are no consistent, widely‐accepted definitions of these diets and different descriptions are used (such as, 'low‐carbohydrate, high‐protein’, 'low‐carbohydrate, high‐fat', or ‘very low‐carbohydrate’). 
Low‐carbohydrate diets are implemented in different ways, but they restrict grains, cereals and legumes, and other carbohydrate‐containing foods; such as dairy, most fruit and certain vegetables. These foods are then typically replaced with foods higher in fat and protein; such as meats, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, oils. Some low‐carbohydrate diets recommend eating as desired, while others recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten.  
Balanced‐carbohydrate diets contain more moderate amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fats, in line with current healthy eating advice from health authorities. When used for weight reduction, balanced diets recommend restricting the amount of energy eaten by guiding people to reduce their portion sizes and choose healthier foods (e.g. lean instead of fatty meat). 
Low‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets are widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'‐carbohydrate weight‐reducing diets.
