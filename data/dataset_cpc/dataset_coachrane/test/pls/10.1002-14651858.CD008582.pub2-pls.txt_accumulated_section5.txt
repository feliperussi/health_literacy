Relaxation for perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms
Review question: We wanted to discover whether relaxation techniques were better or worse than other interventions, such as acupuncture, in the management of menopausal symptoms. We reviewed the evidence on the effects of these techniques on hot flushes, night sweats and sleep disturbances in menopausal women. 
Background: Management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, depressed mood or sleep disturbances, has become more complicated because of increased awareness of the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Options include prescription drugs and self care strategies such as relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques are thought to be relatively harmless, but their effectiveness in treating hot flushes and sleep disturbances remains unclear. 
Study characteristics: We found four randomised controlled studies, with 281 participants. Relaxation was compared with electroacupuncture, superficial needling, paced respiration, placebo and no treatment. The age range of participants was 30 to 77 years. These trials were conducted in Sweden, the UK and the USA. No study was funded by an agency with commercial interest in the results of the study. The evidence is current to February 2014. 
Key results: Evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of relaxation techniques as treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, or to determine whether this treatment is more effective than no treatment, placebo, acupuncture, superficial needle insertion or paced respiration. No evidence indicates that relaxation reduces the number of hot flushes per 24 hours or their severity. None of the studies reported night sweats, sleep disturbances associated with night sweats or adverse effects as an outcome.
