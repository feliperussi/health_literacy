Buflomedil for acute ischaemic stroke
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of buflomedil on death, disability, and neurological functions in people with acute ischaemic stroke. 
Background 
Buflomedil has been used for people with diseases of the leg arteries and has shown some benefits for people with a previous stroke. The most common type of stroke is due to narrowing or blockage of an artery in the brain (i.e. ischaemic stroke). Buflomedil is a drug that can dilate brain blood vessels, which may have benefit for people with ischaemic stroke. However, it has not been approved to treat stroke in clinical practice. We wanted to discover whether buflomedil is effective and safe to treat people within the first few days after the onset of their ischaemic stroke. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to September 2014. We found 26 randomised controlled trials with 2756 participants. All these trials were conducted in China with adult stroke patients of both sexes. All participants were in hospital and within the first few days after the onset of their stroke. Most trials delivered buflomedil intravenously, with a daily dose of 200 mg for 14 days. 
Key results 
There was insufficient evidence to show whether buflomedil reduced the chance of dying or having less long‐term disability in stroke survivors. Although all trials assessed outcomes immediately at the end of treatment, there was no robust evidence on the effects of buflomedil on any short‐term outcomes. Also, there was insufficient evidence on the harms that the drug might cause.
