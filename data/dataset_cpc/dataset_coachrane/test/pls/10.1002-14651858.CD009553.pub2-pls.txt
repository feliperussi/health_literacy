Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for follow‐up of women treated for breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer undergo treatment involving surgery and radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both. With these major advances in breast cancer management, many patients still have to deal with short or long‐term side effects and psychological distress related to the disease and treatment, which have a substantial impact on their quality of life. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation aims to improve outcomes for women but the evidence base for its effectiveness is yet to be established. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes vary and include more than one intervention, usually selected from medical, exercise, education, and psychological counselling and support interventions. This review evaluated trials that assessed the effects of organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation during follow‐up in women treated for breast cancer. 
The review identified only two randomised controlled trials, involving 262 patients with breast cancer. The data from these studies provide low‐grade evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation in producing short‐term gains at the levels of impairment (range of shoulder movement), psychosocial adjustment and quality of life after breast cancer treatment. None of the studies reported the longer‐term functional outcomes of such care, the impact on caregivers or cost effectiveness of these programmes. 
Overall, the results of this review suggest that multidisciplinary rehabilitation is not harmful and may improve functional ability and quality of life in the short term. This review highlights the lack of robust trials in the field and the need for further high‐quality trial‐based research.
