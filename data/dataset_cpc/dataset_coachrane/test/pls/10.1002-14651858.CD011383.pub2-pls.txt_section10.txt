Overall, the short‐term death rate (mortality over a short time) was 30% and serious adverse events (side effects or complications) rate was 139 per 100 participants. The differences in short‐term mortality and percentage of people with serious adverse events were imprecise in all the comparisons. The number of serious adverse events and adverse events were fewer in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy. The complications resulting from the disease and treatment included heart failure (heart does not pump enough blood around the body at the correct pressure), lung failure (lungs do not remove waste products from the blood), kidney failure (kidneys do not remove waste products from the blood), and blood poisoning (micro‐organisms and their poisons are in the blood). The percentage of people with organ failure and the average costs were lower in the minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to open necrosectomy. The number of adverse events were more with the video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to the endoscopic‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach but the total numbers of procedures performed were less with the video‐assisted minimally invasive step‐up approach compared to the endoscopic minimally invasive step‐up approach. The differences in any of the other comparisons for number of serious adverse events, percentage of people with organ failure, number of adverse events, length of hospital stay, and intensive therapy unit stay were either imprecise or were not consistent. None of the trials reported long‐term mortality, infected pancreatic necrosis (in trials that included participants with sterile necrosis), health‐related quality of life (which measures physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning), percentage of people with adverse events, requirement for additional invasive intervention, time to return to normal activity, and time to return to work.
