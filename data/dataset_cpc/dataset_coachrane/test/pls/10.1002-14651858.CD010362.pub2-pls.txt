Drugs (with the exception of botulinum toxin) to treat spasticity after stroke
Question 
Are drugs (with the exception of botulinum toxin) better than a placebo or control in treating spasticity in people with stroke? 
Background 
We wanted to learn whether there was evidence for using drugs for spasticity in people with stroke, and if so, to identify whether drugs that acted on the whole body (systemic drugs) differed in their effects to drugs that acted in a localised area of the body (local drugs). 
Study characteristics 
We included seven studies involving a total of 403 participants. The evidence is current to May 2016. There were variations among the included studies. Two of the studies were placebo controlled, while the rest compared one drug to another drug. Two studies compared two systemic drugs against each other; two studies compared two local drugs against each other; and the fifth study compared a systemic drug against a local drug. 
Key results 
The results for the studies varied, meaning that we could make no clear conclusions. The two studies that used a placebo as a control provided conflicting results; when the results were combined we identified a slight benefit in favour of the treatment group. These two studies provided clear evidence that taking the treatment drug was likely to result in an increased risk of having an adverse event. This review identified a lack of studies and subsequent evidence relating to the use of pharmacological interventions (with the exception of botulinum toxin) to treat spasticity. Future research to identify the best time to start treatment and the optimal dose for treatment is recommended. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence varied. We judged all but one of the studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the six areas considered. The sample sizes in the included studies were relatively low for drug trials; three of the seven studies had 30 or fewer participants.
