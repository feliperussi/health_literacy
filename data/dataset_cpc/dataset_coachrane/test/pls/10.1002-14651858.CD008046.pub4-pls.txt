Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonist versus HCG for oocyte triggering in antagonist‐assisted reproductive technology cycles 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of GnRH agonists on final oocyte maturation triggering in GnRH antagonist IVF/ICSI treatment cycles. 
Background 
Oocyte maturation triggering is the final differentiation process of an immature oocyte before fertilisation in unstimulated or stimulated cycles with assisted reproductive techniques. Two hormones can be used to trigger oocyte maturation: human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), which is the standard treatment, and gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). In this review, we assessed the benefits and harms of GnRH agonists as oocyte maturation triggers. Evidence is current to September 2014. 
Study characteristics 
We included 17 studies of 1817 women. Researchers assessed fresh or donor cycles in women at varying risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The authors of four studies stated that the studies were commercially funded. Most studies failed to disclose their funding source. 
Key results 
GnRH agonist triggers significantly reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation but also lower the chance of pregnancy in fresh autologous IVF/ICSI treatment cycles compared with HCG. GnRH agonist use as an oocyte maturation trigger could be useful for women who choose to avoid fresh transfers (for whatever reason), women who donate oocytes to recipients or women who wish to freeze their eggs for later use in the context of fertility preservation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence was moderate for most comparisons. The main limitation in the quality of the evidence was risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods.
