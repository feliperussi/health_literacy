Thyroid hormones for acute kidney injury
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a number of causes including infection, trauma, kidney stones, toxic drugs, or acquired during hospital treatment. People with AKI suddenly lose kidney function leading to poor urine output and retention of body wastes. In every 1000 people who are discharged from hospital about 30 are diagnosed with AKI; about 6% of all critically ill patients have AKI. Many people with AKI will die from the disease. 
AKI treatment aims to restore kidney function using drugs, kidney dialysis, or both. Experimental animal studies of thyroid hormone therapy (a drug treatment) held promise, but uncertainty existed about its effectiveness and safety for people. 
We searched the medical literature to investigate the benefits and harms of thyroid hormone therapy for adults with AKI of any cause who were in hospital and found two studies that involved 97 people. There were many differences between study populations, particularly participants' kidney history (some had their own kidneys; others had transplants); and the drugs that were investigated. These differences meant that we were unable to statistically evaluate (meta‐analyse) study data. 
We found that risk of death from any cause was much higher among people with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy compared with those who received placebo in one study; no deaths were reported in the second study. Thyroid hormone therapy was found to be no better or worse than placebo in changing patients' needs for kidney dialysis or transplant. People with AKI who received thyroid hormone therapy needed dialysis for longer than those who received placebo in one study, but no differences in AKI and dialysis durations were noted in the other. Lengths of stay in intensive care units and hospital were similar in both those who received thyroid hormone therapy and placebo in one study; but not reported in the other study. Neither study reported if any participants progressed to end‐stage kidney disease. We had planned to analyse changes in kidney function and numbers of dialysis sessions, but data reporting was insufficient to make assessments.
