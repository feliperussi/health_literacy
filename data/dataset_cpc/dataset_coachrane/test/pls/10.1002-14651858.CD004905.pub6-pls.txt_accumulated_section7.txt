Vitamin and mineral supplements for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many women have poor diets and are deficient in nutrients and micronutrients that are required for good health. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are needed by the body in very small quantities, but are important for normal functioning, growth and development. During pregnancy, these women often become more deficient because of the need to provide nutrition for the baby too, and this can negatively affect their health, along with the health of the baby. 
Why is this important? 
Combining multiple micronutrients into one supplement has been suggested as a cost‐effective way to achieve multiple benefits for women during pregnancy. Micronutrient deficiencies are known to interact, and a greater effect may be achieved by multiple supplementation rather than single‐nutrient supplementation. However, interactions could also lead to poor absorption of some of the nutrients. High doses of some nutrients may also cause harm to the mother or her baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (23 February 2018). This systematic review included 21 trials (involving 142,496 women), but only 20 trials (involving 141,849 women) contributed data. The included trials compared pregnant women who supplemented their diets with multiple micronutrients (including iron and folic acid) with pregnant women who received iron (with or without folic acid) or a placebo. Overall, we found that pregnant women who received multiple‐micronutrient supplementation had fewer babies that were born too small (weighing less than 2500 g), fewer babies who were smaller in size than normal for their gestational age, and fewer births that occurred before week 37 of pregnancy. The evidence for the main outcomes of low birthweight and small‐for‐gestational age was found to be of high quality and moderate quality, respectively.
