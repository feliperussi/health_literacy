Knee length versus thigh length graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep vein thrombosis in postoperative surgical patients 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the related condition pulmonary embolism are the most common preventable causes of hospital‐related deaths, accounting for 10% of the deaths in UK hospitals. Based on these facts, the use of graduated compression stockings is widely accepted for all patients admitted into hospital. It is still unclear, however, whether knee length or thigh length stockings are more effective in preventing DVT (thromboprophylaxis). The pressure exerted is greatest at the ankle and then gradually decreases at the calf level. Thigh length graduated compression stockings distribute their mechanical effect over a greater proportion of the leg. The aim of this Cochrane review was to systematically analyse trials that evaluated the effectiveness of knee length versus thigh length graduated compression stockings in hospitalised patients following surgery. Three randomised controlled trials that involved 496 patients undergoing surgery were included in this review. 
Due to the limited number of patients and trials, and significant differences between the included trials, the conclusion may be weak. There was insufficient high quality evidence to determine whether or not knee length and thigh length graduated compression stockings differed in their effectiveness in terms of reducing the incidence of DVT in hospitalised patients. The majority of patients analysed in this review also received heparin and physiotherapy, along with the use of either knee length or thigh length stockings. A major multicentre RCT is required. In the meantime, the decision on which type of stocking to use in clinical practice is likely to be influenced by factors such as patient compliance, ease of use and cost implications.
