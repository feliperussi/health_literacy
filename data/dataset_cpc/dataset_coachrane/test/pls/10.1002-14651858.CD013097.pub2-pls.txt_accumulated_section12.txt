Educational programs and training to prevent lead uptake in workers exposed to lead
Background 
On a daily basis, workers in a wide range of industries come in contact with a harmful metal called lead. There is no known level of exposure to lead that does not cause harm to health, therefore, reducing exposure is essential. Educational programmes and training can prevent the uptake of lead in workers. 
What is the aim of this review? 
We searched five databases for randomised (RCT) and non‐randomised studies to assess the effectiveness of these educational programmes. 
Key messages 
Educational interventions may prevent lead poisoning in workers but we are very uncertain of this finding, therefore, more studies of better quality are required. 
What was studied in the review? 
We included four uncontrolled before‐after studies in this review. The studies assessed the effectiveness of educational interventions for preventing lead uptake in workers exposed to lead. We assessed a critical risk of bias in three studies and a moderate risk of bias in one. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Very low‐quality evidence from three studies with participants with high baseline blood lead levels, suggested a decrease in blood lead after education; one study with participants with low baseline blood lead found conflicting results. Very low‐quality evidence from one study suggested a decrease in urinary lead levels. 
There may be an effect, but we are very uncertain if educational interventions are effective in preventing lead poisoning in workers with high baseline blood lead levels and urine lead levels. For workers with low baseline blood lead levels, the results were inconclusive.
