Midazolam for sedation before procedures
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether midazolam makes medical procedures more comfortable for children and adults, as well as whether it makes the procedure easier to perform. 
Background 
Children and adults can become anxious during medical procedures and the procedures can be painful. Pain and anxiety can sometimes make the procedure more difficult to perform for the medical staff, due to movement or a lack of co‐operation from the patient. Sedative medications, including midazolam, are used to reduce pain and anxiety. They can be injected directly into the bloodstream (with an almost immediate effect), injected into muscle tissue, given as a nasal spray, or swallowed as a tablet or solution. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to January 2016. We included 30 trials involving 2319 participants. We looked at trials that compared midazolam with no active treatment ('dummy' treatment/placebo) or a different medication for sedation before a procedure. The trials involved children and adults having procedures to diagnose medical problems rather than procedures for treatment of a disease. We disregarded trials where people received a general anaesthetic or other medications for sedation or pain relief in addition to midazolam during their procedure. 
Key results 
Midazolam administered into the bloodstream compared with other medications did not seem to make the participants more drowsy, reduce anxiety or pain, or make the procedure easier to perform. This is based on the low‐quality evidence currently available. A potential benefit is that children and adults who received midazolam compared with no active treatment did not remember as much about the procedures. Midazolam made them drowsy, reduced anxiety and made it easier to perform a procedure. There is moderate‐quality evidence that a solution of midazolam given to children to drink before a procedure was not as effective as a different medication called chloral hydrate. A nasal spray of midazolam before a procedure made the participants drowsy and reduced their anxiety, but this did not make it easier to perform procedures on them. This review cannot be used to assess the harms of midazolam for sedation before a procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the evidence, in the main, as being of low quality. Particularly concerning was that many trials did not explain how participants were randomized to either midazolam or to a different treatment, and that the results did not give us a very clearly defined answer.
