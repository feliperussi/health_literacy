Maintenance treatments for opiate‐dependent adolescents
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of maintenance treatment either alone or associated with psychosocial intervention compared with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacological intervention, pharmacological detoxification or psychosocial intervention in adolescents (13 to 18 years). 
Background 
Substance abuse among adolescents (13 to 18 years old) is a serious and growing problem. It is important to identify effective treatments for those who are opioid‐dependent. The most common drugs used by young people worldwide are cannabis and inhalants. Psychostimulants (ecstasy and amphetamines), cocaine, LSD, heroin and other opioids are also used. Many adolescents who use heroin start by snorting it but some progress to injection. Heroin is used sporadically by the majority who use it, but it can become an addictive disorder. In adults, pharmacotherapy is a necessary and acceptable part of effective treatment for opioid dependence. Among adolescents, medications have been used infrequently and a choice has to be made between detoxification and maintenance treatment. Among maintenance treatment methadone and buprenorphine are the most frequently used drugs. Methadone needs daily doses, while LAAM (levomethadyl acetate hydrochloride) must be taken every two or three days. LAAM has been withdrawn from the market because of concerns about life‐threatening effects on the heart . 
Psychosocial interventions are interventions that use psychological or social strategy to achieve a therapeutic benefit in inpatient. The most common used approaches are: Cognitive‐behavioural therapy,methods based on the assumption that since substance abuse among adolescents is a learned behaviour it can be unlearned as well; contingency management ,which uses reinforcement and punishment contingencies to enhance motivation: family therapy which is based on the conceptualisation that adolescent substance abuse stem from maladaptive family interactions; drug counselling which includes a strong emphasis on abstinence, assistance with social, family and legal problems. It focuses on behaviours and external events rather than intrapsychic processes; therapeutic community and motivational approach which rather than confront the patient's resistance to abstinence in a direct and sometimes aggressive manner, "rolls with resistance". At he same time, he tries to help the patient develop more self‐motivation to stop using via specified techniques
