Opioids for cancer‐related pain in children and adolescents
Bottom line  
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or contradict the suggestion that opioids in any dose will reduce cancer‐related pain in children or adolescents. 
Background  
Childhood cancer is one of the leading causes of disease and death for children and adolescents in the world today. Its associated pain is a major health concern and specific data for children are not currently well known. Cancer‐related pain is generally caused directly by a tumour compressing on nerves or by organ inflammation, and can very distressing. 
Opioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most developed countries but access may be restricted in developing countries. For example, currently available opioids include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are used in varying doses and commonly administered via injection or oral tablets. 
Key results  
In February 2017 we searched for clinical trials where any opioids were used to treat cancer‐related pain in people aged from birth to 17 years. We found no studies that met the requirements for this review. Several studies tested opioids on adults with cancer‐related pain, but none in participants aged from birth to 17 years. 
Quality of the evidence  
We planned to rate the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. 
We were unable to rate the quality of evidence as there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the suggestion that opioids in any dose will reduce cancer‐related pain in children or adolescents.
