Surgery for rotator cuff disease
Background 
The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that holds the shoulder joint in place allowing people to lift their arm and reach overhead. Some people can develop pain in their shoulder related to wear and tear of the rotator cuff. There may also be inflammation of the shoulder tendons or bursa (another part of the shoulder that helps it move), and pressure on the tendons by the overlying bone when lifting the arm up (impingement). Often the pain is made worse by sleeping on the affected shoulder and moving the shoulder in certain directions. 
Surgery on your rotator cuff may include removing part of your bone to take the pressure off the rotator cuff tendons (acromioplasty), removing any swollen or inflamed bursa (the small sack of fluid that cushions the shoulder joint), and removing any damaged tissue or bone to widen the space where the tendons pass (subacromial decompression). Most rotator cuff surgery is now performed arthroscopically (surgical instruments are inserted through a small incision or key hole to perform surgery). 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to 22 October 2018. Trials were performed in hospitals in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the UK. We included eight trials (1062 participants), comparing surgery with placebo (fake) surgery or other non‐operative treatment, such as exercise in people with impingement of the shoulder rotator cuff tendons. 
The number of participants ranged from 42 to 313, mean age from 42 to 65 years, and duration of follow‐up from one year up to 12 to 13 years. Five trials failed to report funding sources, three received funding from non‐commercial foundations, and one trial author was paid by an instrument company.
