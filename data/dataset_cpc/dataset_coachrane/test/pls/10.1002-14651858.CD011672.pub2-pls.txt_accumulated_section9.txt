Surfactant therapy via thin catheter in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome 
Review question 
Is giving surfactant via a minimally invasive technique involving placement of a thin catheter in the trachea of a spontaneously breathing infant effective and safe? 
Background 
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is an important cause of disease and death in preterm infants. It is commonly treated with a medication called surfactant, which is given by a tube (called an endotracheal tube, or ETT). The ETT is placed in the windpipe (trachea). However, more infants with RDS are now being treated from the onset with non‐invasive respiratory support (through a mask) without use of an ETT. This means that the usual means of administering surfactant is not available. In such infants, surfactant therapy requires placement of an ETT, with or without the intent to remove it soon after the procedure. Surfactant improves clinical outcomes, but insertion of the ETT and mechanical ventilation (assisted breathing) can cause lung injury. This can contribute to development of a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and other problems. Alternatives to ETT insertion have been developed. The most popular method is the use of a thin catheter (tube) that is briefly inserted into the windpipe. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the electronic databases and found 16 randomised trials (18 publications) that met our selection criteria. These trials involved delivery of surfactant via a thin catheter. Evidence is up‐to‐date as of 30 September 2020. 
Key results 
Surfactant delivery via a thin catheter to spontaneously breathing preterm infants compared with surfactant administration through an ETT was associated with a decrease in the following: risk of death or BPD, need for assisted breathing in the first 72 hours of life, severe brain bleeding, death during first hospitalisation, and BPD among survivors. We are uncertain as to whether the intervention has an important effect on air leak requiring drainage because the results are imprecise. None of the studies reported on the outcome of death or survival with disability. The procedure had rates of adverse effects similar to surfactant administration through an ETT. These data suggest that treatment with surfactant via a thin catheter is preferable to surfactant therapy through an ETT. Further well‐designed studies of adequate size and power, as well as ongoing studies, are required to confirm and refine these findings, and to clarify whether surfactant therapy via a thin catheter provides benefits over continuation of non‐invasive respiratory support without surfactant.
