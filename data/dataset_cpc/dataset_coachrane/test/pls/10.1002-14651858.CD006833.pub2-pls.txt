Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression
Review Question 
This review summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials that test whether Reiki if beneficial for people with anxiety or depression. 
Background 
Reiki is a non‐drug treatment that is used on people with anxiety, depression or both. Reiki is a 2500 year old treatment, described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. But there is no systematic review of randomised trials evaluating whether it works in this group of people. 
Study characteristics 
We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy‐proven diagnosis of prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external‐beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community‐living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students.These studies included people with anxiety or depression or both, and reported their results separately. This included only 25 people with anxiety, 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression but which was not specified. The search is up to date as of 4 November 2014. 
Key results 
Very few people with anxiety or depression or both have been included in randomised studies. This means there is insufficient evidence to make any comment about the usefulness of Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression. 
Quality of the evidence 
At best, the quality of the evidence is moderate which, on top of a dearth of evidence, weakens the findings further.
