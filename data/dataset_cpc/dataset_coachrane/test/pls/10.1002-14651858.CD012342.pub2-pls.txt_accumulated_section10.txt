In people with bone marrow disorders, a comparison of giving platelet transfusions only when bleeding occurs to also giving them to prevent bleeding 
Review aim 
In people with bone marrow disorders bleeding can be a problem due to a low platelet count, or because the platelets do not work properly, or both. Platelet transfusions can be given when bleeding occurs in order to stop the bleeding, or before bleeding occurs in order to prevent it. 
In this review we investigated whether transfusions should be given only when bleeding occurs, or in advance as a preventative measure. Our target population was people of any age with bone marrow disorders. 
Background 
The bone marrow is where many types of blood cells are produced. Red blood cells are needed to bring oxygen to all parts of the body; white blood cells fight against infection; and platelets in the blood help to form clots and prevent bleeding. Bone marrow failure can have different causes and can happen at birth or later in life, and may result in too few of any or all of the three types of blood cells in the body. 
Too few platelets can put a person at risk of serious or life‐threatening bleeding. Platelet transfusions have been commonly used to prevent or treat bleeding in people with bone marrow disorders. However, there are risks involved with regular use of platelet transfusions, such as transfusion reactions and transfusion‐transmitted infections. 
It is currently unclear if the best transfusion policy is to give platelet transfusions only when bleeding occurs or to give them to prevent bleeding. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical studies (randomised controlled trials and well‐designed non‐randomised studies) of people of any age with bone marrow disorders and a low platelet count. The evidence is current to 12 October 2017. One study was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study was stopped after recruiting only nine participants because it had taken three years to recruit the nine participants (the study had planned to recruit 60 participants in two years). We found no ongoing studies.
