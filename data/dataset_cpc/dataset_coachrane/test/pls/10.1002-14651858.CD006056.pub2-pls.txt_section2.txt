Patients with severe lung disease, such as acute respiratory failure, may require invasive mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy until their underlying disease is either treated or stabilized. Both early suspension of or delay in withdrawing mechanical ventilation can however lead to complications that may delay the weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation and prolong their length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. Previous studies and systematic reviews suggest that a weaning protocol should be implemented in order to make daily assessments of patients who may be ready for weaning from mechanical ventilation. The ability to breathe spontaneously can be assessed with a spontaneous breathing trial using a T‐tube (T‐piece) or by reducing the applied airway pressure to provide low levels of pressure support (PS) (5 to 10 cm H2O). After removal of the endotracheal tube (extubation) the patients are monitored for 48 hours. If over this period ventilatory support does not need to be reintroduced, this is taken to indicate successful weaning. For this Cochrane systematic review we searched the medical literature databases until June 2012 and included nine studies with 1208 adult patients who had been on invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. The trials compared pressure support (PS) and the use of a T‐tube (622 patients randomized to PS and 586 randomized to a T‐tube). There was no clear evidence to confirm that PS was superior to a T‐tube with regard to the success of weaning, need for reintubation, ICU mortality, and other factors including long‐term weaning unit (LWU) length of stay, pneumonia and a rapid shallow breathing index. Among patients who received PS, a greater number of patients had a successful spontaneous breathing trial and the airway tube was removed. For respiratory rate and tidal volume outcomes PS was superior to using a T‐tube in two trials. Three studies reported that the weaning duration was shorter during PS, and in one study in which patients submitted to a T‐tube the weaning time was shorter. Because of limitations in the design of the studies and imprecision in the effect estimates we have rated the quality of the evidence to be low. We reran the search in December 2013. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.
