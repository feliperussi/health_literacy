Is endometrial resection or ablation more effective, safer or more acceptable than different routes of hysterectomy? 
Review question 
This review compares the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of endometrial resection or ablation (EA/ER) compared to different routes of hysterectomy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). 
Background 
Surgical treatments for HMB include: endometrial resection or ablation (removal or destruction of the endometrium (inside lining) of the uterus (womb)) and hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus). Hysterectomy can be performed by different routes: by a surgical cut to the abdomen (open), by a minimally invasive procedure that can be by the vagina, or by laparoscopy (a 'keyhole' operation that involves very small surgical cuts to the abdomen). Hysterectomy is effective in permanently stopping HMB, but it halts fertility and is associated with the risks of major surgery, including infection and blood loss. Endometrial resection/ablation is performed by the vagina and cervix (entrance to the uterus). 
Search date 
In July 2020, we searched for studies that compared endometrial resection/ablation versus hysterectomy for the treatment of HMB. We included 10 studies involving 1966 women. 
Study characteristics 
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing endometrial ablation or resection and hysterectomy as treatment for HMB. The studies excluded women who had gone through the menopause or had cancer (or precancer) of the uterus. 
Key results and conclusions 
Women having EA/ER are probably less likely to perceive an improvement in HMB and more likely to require surgery for treatment failure compared to women having open hysterectomy. They probably have a similar quality of life and satisfaction rates, and may also have similar proportions of serious side effects. Some uncommon but important complications, such as infection and bleeding, are more common during open hysterectomy than with EA/ER. 
Women having EA/ER may have a similar rate of perceiving HMB improvement, but may be less likely to have an objective decrease in blood loss, compared to women having minimally invasive hysterectomy. The EA/ER group probably have a lower quality of life and satisfaction rate. The rate of serious side effects is probably similar but women having EA/ER are probably at increased risk of surgery for treatment failure when compared to minimally invasive hysterectomy. The time taken for women to return to normal activity was shorter with EA/ER than with minimally invasive hysterectomy. 
Women having EA/ER may be less likely to perceive an improvement in HMB and an improvement in general health compared to women having an unspecified route of hysterectomy (or at surgeon's discretion). EA/ER probably increases the chances of having surgery for treatment failure, but decreases the chances of any serious side effects and has shorter time to return to normal activity if compared to the unspecified route of hysterectomy.
