Antidepressants for the treatment of people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence 
Review question 
This review investigated whether antidepressants reduce the severity of depression or alcohol dependence (or both) in people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence. 
Background 
The co‐occurrence of major depression in people entering treatment for alcohol dependence is common and increases the severity of the condition reducing the effectiveness of treatments. Treatment of these people with medicines is challenging. In this review, we compared the results obtained by people with co‐occurring depression and alcohol dependence treated with antidepressant medicines to those treated with placebo (a sham/pretend treatment) or other treatments.

Study characteristics 
We identified 33 medical trials involving 2242 participants: 68% were male, and the mean age was 42 years. 
Most studies compared antidepressants to placebo (22 studies), but some compared one antidepressant to antidepressant (five studies), to another type of medicine (four studies), or to psychotherapy (a talking treatment; two studies). The average duration of the trials was 10 weeks (range 3 to 26 weeks). A total of 18 trials took place in the USA, and the others were in Europe, Turkey, and Australia. The antidepressant used in most of the trials was sertraline; the others were: amitriptyline, citalopram, desipramine, doxepin, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, mianserin, mirtazepine, nefazodone, paroxetine, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and viloxazine. The studies used 49 different rating scales and varied in terms of design, quality, participant characteristics, tested medicines, services provided, and treatments administered. 
A total of 19 studies reported the source of funding (public funds: six studies; pharmaceutical industry: two studies; both funds: 10 studies). 
Only four trials reported a declaration of the authors reporting possible conflicts of interest. 
Key results 
In the 22 studies comparing antidepressants to placebo, antidepressants may have reduced the severity of depression but we are uncertain whether it increased the number of people with clinical beneficial effects from the reduction of depression severity (response to treatment, i.e. people who halved the severity of depression). However, we found no difference between antidepressants and placebo in other relevant outcomes related to the severity of depression, such as the number of people without depression at the end of the trial (remission). 
In addition, we found that the administration of antidepressants probably reduced alcohol consumption evaluated as the number of participants abstinent during the treatment (higher among participants who received antidepressants compared to placebo) and the number of drinks consumed per drinking days (lower among participants who received antidepressants compared to placebo). However, similarly to what we found for the severity of depression, we also observed that the administration of antidepressants did not affect other relevant outcomes related to alcohol dependence, such as the rate of abstinent days, number of heavy drinkers, and time before first relapse. 
In terms of safety issues, the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to side effects (undesirable effects such as dry mouth) may not differ between antidepressants and placebo.
