Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of dietary interventions on pain in children aged between five and 18 years with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). 
Background 
Recurrent abdominal pain, or RAP, is a term used for unexplained episodes of stomachache or abdominal pain in children. Recurrent abdominal pain is a common condition, and most children are likely to be helped by simple measures. However, a range of treatments have been recommended to relieve abdominal pain, including making changes to the child's eating habits by adding supplements or excluding certain foods. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to June 2016.
Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose‐restricted diet. 
All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. 
Key results 
Probiotics 
We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. 
Fibre supplements 
We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. 
Low FODMAP diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. 
Fructose‐restricted diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose‐restricted diets in children with RAP. 
Conclusion 
We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best.
