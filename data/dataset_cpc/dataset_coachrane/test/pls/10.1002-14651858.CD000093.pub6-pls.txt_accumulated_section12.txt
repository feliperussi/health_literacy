Metal implants used to fix broken bones near the hip joint in older adults
Key messages 
‐ Extramedullary implants produce very similar outcomes overall to cephalomedullary nails in the treatment of this type of hip fracture. 
‐ There is a reduced risk of infection and non‐union (in which the bone fails to heal) with cephalomedullary nails, but an increased risk of implant‐related fracture. 
Hip fractures in older people 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the thigh bone. In this review, we included people with a break near the hip joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. 
What are the treatments? 
A common way of mending this type of break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants.  
‐ During an operation, the surgeon may insert a metal rod (nail) through the top of the leg bone down towards the knee. This nail (called a cephalomedullary nail) is held in place with screws.  
‐ Alternatively, the surgeon may use a metal plate which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone (called an extramedullary implant) which is attached to the bone with screws. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared these two types of treatment. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies to see if we could find out if one treatment was better than another.
