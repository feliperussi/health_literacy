Pain relievers for children with acute middle ear infection
Review question 
We wanted to find out if pain relievers are effective for relieving pain in children with acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media (AOM)) and which medications, alone or together, provide the most effective pain relief. 
Background 
Acute middle ear infection or AOM is one of the most common childhood infections. Ear pain due to middle ear infection and pressure building up behind the eardrum is the key symptom of AOM and central to children's and parents' experience of the illness. Because antibiotics provide only marginal benefits, pain relievers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the cornerstone of AOM management in children.

Study characteristics 
We included data from three trials of low to moderate risk of bias of 327 children with AOM. One trial (219 children) compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus a dummy drug in children with AOM. In this trial, all children also received antibiotic treatment and those with fever > 39 °C may have received paracetamol in addition to the studied treatments. Two other trials compared the effects of paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol in children with fever and patients with respiratory tract infections, respectively. The authors of these two trials provided crude subgroup data on children with AOM (26 and 82 children, respectively). 
Study funding sources 
In one trial, paracetamol, ibuprofen and a dummy drug were supplied by a pharmaceutical company (Ethypharm). No further details were provided about the role of this company in the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of the trial. The other two trials were funded by governmental (non‐commercial) grants. In one trial the drugs were purchased from and provided by two companies (Pfizer and DHP Investigational Medicinal Products) which had no role in the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of the trial.
