Can ethical case interventions improve healthcare?
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether ethical case interventions could improve care for patients. Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. A typical example for situations in which ethical conflicts can arise are cases in which it is uncertain whether provision or limitation of treatment is in line with patients' will or patient welfare (or both). Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts discussing ethical challenges of patient care (specific patient situations) with different health professionals responsible for the care of the patient as well as the patient and his family. The aim of ethical case interventions is to support decision‐making in clinical practice. Researchers in Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies to determine whether ethical case interventions improve patient care and found four relevant studies published in six articles. 
Key messages 
It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention reduced the decisional conflict of those who need to make decisions about treatment, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We found no studies reporting effects of ethical case interventions on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, patients' quality of life or ethical competency. It was uncertain whether ethical case intervention increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. We need more high‐quality studies to evaluate ethical case intervention. 
What was studied in this review ? 
We chose the decisional conflict of participants affected by the decision, reduction of moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making and quality of life of patients as main outcome criteria to assess whether ethical case interventions improve health care. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review authors found four relevant studies with results published in six articles. All studies compared ethical case interventions with usual care in intensive care units. The studies used two different models of ethical case interventions – proactive and request‐based ethics consultation. In proactive ethics consultation, the ethicist himself/herself identifies potential ethical conflicts without being requested or ethics consultation is offered in response to latent conflicts. In request‐based ethics consultation, professionals, patients or their families specifically ask for an ethics consultation to resolve a specific ethical conflict. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. 
Three studies reported on proactive ethics consultation. We found no data on decisional conflict, moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency. One study assessed satisfaction with care. It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation increased satisfaction with care, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
One study reported on request‐based ethics consultation. The study assessed the level of consensus regarding decisions about the care of patients as an indirect criterion for the reduction of decisional conflict. It was uncertain whether request‐based ethics consultation increased consensus and, thus, reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. We found no data on moral distress, patient involvement in decision‐making, quality of life of patients or ethical competency.
