Cultural competence education for health professionals
This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors. 
The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes. 
The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.
