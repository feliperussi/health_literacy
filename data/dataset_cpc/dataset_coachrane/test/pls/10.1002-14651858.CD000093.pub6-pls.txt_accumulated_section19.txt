Metal implants used to fix broken bones near the hip joint in older adults
Key messages 
‐ Extramedullary implants produce very similar outcomes overall to cephalomedullary nails in the treatment of this type of hip fracture. 
‐ There is a reduced risk of infection and non‐union (in which the bone fails to heal) with cephalomedullary nails, but an increased risk of implant‐related fracture. 
Hip fractures in older people 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the thigh bone. In this review, we included people with a break near the hip joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. 
What are the treatments? 
A common way of mending this type of break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants.  
‐ During an operation, the surgeon may insert a metal rod (nail) through the top of the leg bone down towards the knee. This nail (called a cephalomedullary nail) is held in place with screws.  
‐ Alternatively, the surgeon may use a metal plate which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone (called an extramedullary implant) which is attached to the bone with screws. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared these two types of treatment. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies to see if we could find out if one treatment was better than another. 
What did we find? 
We found 76 studies, involving a total of 10,979 adults with 10,988 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 54 to 85 years and 72% were women; this is usual for people who have this type of fracture. 
We found that there is probably little difference between treatment with a cephalomedullary nail or an extramedullary implant in the number of people who die within four months of surgery or at 12 months. There may be little or no difference in the number of people who experience confusion (also called delirium) after their surgery, and little or no difference in hip function (ability to use the hip) at four months after surgery. There may also be little or no difference in the number of people who need an additional operation on their broken hip. We are unsure whether there is a difference in how well a person can perform their daily activities, or in their health‐related quality of life at four months. We are also unsure whether cephalomedullary nails improve a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick) at four months. 
We also looked at possible side effects (or harms) from the fracture itself or from using one or other of the implants. For most types of common side effects in hip fracture surgery, there was no evidence of a difference between these two types of implants. We found that fewer people had an infection at the site of surgery, or a broken bone that failed to heal (called a non‐union), when a cephalomedullary nail was used. However, more people had a fracture during or after surgery when a cephalomedullary nail was used.  
Are we confident in what we found? 
‐ We are moderately confident in the findings about how many people die after surgery. A large number of studies reported this, and the findings were often similar. 
‐ We were less confident about the evidence for delirium, hip function, and additional operations. These findings included the possibility of a benefit with one of the treatments (for example, fewer operations) as well as the possibility of harm (for example, more operations).
