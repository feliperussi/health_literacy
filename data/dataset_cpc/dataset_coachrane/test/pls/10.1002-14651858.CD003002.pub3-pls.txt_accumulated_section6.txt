Drug therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults
Background  Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is caused by collapse of the upper airway. The mainstay of medical treatment is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), delivered through a mask during sleep, aiming to keep the airway opened. Drug therapy has been proposed for individuals with mild OSA and those intolerant of CPAP. 
Review question  We wanted to look at the evidence from randomised controlled trials which compared drug therapy with placebo for sleep apnoea. 
What we did  We searched and reviewed all randomised placebo controlled trials of drugs to treat OSA in adult patients. Most of the trials had methodological flaws or were for only one or two nights, which is hardly long enough to find out whether the treatments are effective or acceptable to the people taking them. 
Results  Of 25 drugs tested, 10 had some impact on the severity of OSA (as measured by the apnoea hypopnoea index or AHI) and four altered symptoms of sleepiness, although in most people changes were only modest. 
Eszopiclone, acetazolamide, naltrexone, physiostigmine and nasal lubricant (phosphocholinamine) were trialled for one to two nights only and the long‐term effects are therefore unknown. A topical nasal steroid was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea and improved subjective daytime alertness in a specific subgroup of people with both OSA and rhinitis. Acetazolamide reduced the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep but did not reduce daytime sleepiness and was poorly tolerated long term. Paroxetine had only a small effect on the severity of OSA and while it was tolerated there was no useful effect on daytime symptoms. In contrast, participants reported a symptomatic benefit from protriptyline but there was no improvement in OSA, suggesting a different mechanism for their improved sense of well‐being. The antidepressant mirtazapine improved the severity of sleep apnoea in older trials, however two more recent, larger trials failed to demonstrated the same results; moreover, participants experienced side effects of sleepiness and weight gain. Donepezil, well established in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, improved oxygen saturation and the severity of OSA in patients with and without dementia. In people with no dementia it was shown to reduce sleepiness but the study was small and neither the AHI nor ESS were normalised. Further trials are needed to confirm these results. Eszopliclone reduced the severity of OSA in selected patients nonetheless larger scale trials are needed to verify the results.
