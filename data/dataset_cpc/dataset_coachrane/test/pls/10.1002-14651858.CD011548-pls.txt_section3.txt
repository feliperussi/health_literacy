Bile, produced in the liver and stored temporarily in the gallbladder, is released into the small bowel on eating fatty food. The common bile duct is the tube through which bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel. Stones in the common bile duct (common bile duct stones), usually formed in the gallbladder before migration into the bile duct, can obstruct the flow of bile leading to jaundice (yellowish discolouration of skin, white of the eyes, and dark urine); infection of the bile (cholangitis); and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can be life threatening. Various diagnostic tests can be performed for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones. Depending upon the availability of resources, these stones are removed endoscopically (usually the case) or may be removed as a part of the operation performed to remove the gallbladder (it is important to remove the gallbladder since the stones continue to form in the gallbladder and can cause recurrent problems). Non‐invasive tests such as ultrasound (use of sound waves higher than audible range to differentiate tissues based on how they reflect the sound waves) and blood markers of bile flow obstruction such as serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase are used to identify people at high risk of having common bile duct stones. Using non‐invasive tests means that only those people at high risk can be subjected to further tests. We reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests for detection of common bile duct stones. The evidence is current to September 2012.
