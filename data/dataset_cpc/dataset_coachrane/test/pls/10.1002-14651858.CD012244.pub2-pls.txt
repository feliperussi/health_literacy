Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation followed by three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary liver cancer. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high‐risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, a minority of the people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection (removal). Since transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a procedure to restrict the blood supply to a tumour) was introduced as a palliative (to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life) treatment in people with unresectable liver cancer, it has become one of the most common forms of intervention. More recently, the modern radiation technology of three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3‐DCRT), which shapes the radiation beams to the shape of the tumour, has been used to improve the adverse effects of conventional radiotherapy. It is predicted that the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT could enhance the treatment effect for hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, little is known about the benefits and harms of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT, and current studies are still controversial for the efficacy of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to compare the benefits and harms of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered to be unsuitable for surgical removal. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT for the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare their benefits and harms with TACE alone. We collected and analysed data from randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive TACE or 3‐DCRT. Evidence is current to May 2018. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
The review included eight trials with 632 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias. TACE followed by 3‐DCRT appeared to be superior to TACE in improving death from any cause and tumour response, despite an increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin (measured by a blood test to see how well the liver is working). No trials reported serious side effects. One trial reported health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), but this was ill‐defined. The review findings were uncertain because the included trials had methodological weaknesses. More high‐quality randomised clinical trials are needed to confirm or complete the review findings.
