Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease
Review question 
Can inhaled nitric oxide relieve pain crises in people with sickle cell disease and does it have other beneficial effects (such as lessening the severity of pain, shortening hospital stays, or decreasing how often crises happen again) or any harmful effects? 
Background 
Sickle cell disease is a condition that affects the red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are round, but in people with sickle cell disease some of the red blood cells can have an abnormal shape like a crescent (or a sickle, a tool with a curved blade). The abnormally shaped cells easily become stuck in blood vessels, which can cause episodes of severe pain known as pain crises. The pain can be in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body, and can last from several hours to days. 
Painkillers are the main treatment of these pain crises. Another suggested treatment is inhaled nitric oxide, a gas that can relax the blocked blood vessels so they can widen and allow the sickled cells to pass. We wanted to find out whether inhaled nitric oxide is effective in relieving pain in people with sickle cell disease.

Trial characteristics 
We included three trials with 188 people (equal numbers of males and females) with sickle cell disease who were experiencing a pain crisis. Most participants were adults, aside for one trial conducted in a children's hospital where most participants were children over 10 years of age. The trials compared inhaled nitric oxide with a placebo (dummy treatment, i.e. room air) which does not provide pain relief. Participants were assigned to one or the other treatment group at random. The treatments lasted for four hours in two trials and eight hours in the third trial. 
Key results 
Only one large trial (150 participants) reported time until the pain stopped, finding no difference between nitric oxide or room air. This trial was also the only trial to report on the frequency of pain crises in the follow‚Äêup period, and we found little or no difference between inhaled nitric oxide and room air for a return to the emergency department or for readmission to hospital. All three trials reported pain scores: the larger trial found no difference between nitric oxide or room air at each time point up to eight hours, but the two smaller trials (38 participants) reported a benefit of inhaled nitric oxide in relieving the pain after four hours; however, these trials were small and limited compared to the first trial. 
All three trials reported that inhaled nitric oxide had no effect on decreasing the use of painkillers, but there were no data that could be analysed. Two trials reported the average duration of stay in hospital: in the large trial those who were given room air had a shorter stay, whilst the smaller trial conducted at the children's hospital reported a shorter stay in those treated with inhaled nitric oxide. Only the larger trial reported on harmful effects of nitric oxide, finding little or no difference between treatment groups. 
We could not combine the available data from the three included trials due to differences in the reporting of outcomes. As a result, the currently available evidence is not enough to give a clear answer about the use of inhaled nitric oxide for people with sickle cell disease experiencing a pain crisis.
