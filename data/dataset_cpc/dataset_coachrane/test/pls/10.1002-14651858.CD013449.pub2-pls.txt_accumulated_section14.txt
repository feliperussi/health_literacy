Myofunctional therapy (oropharyngeal ‐ mouth and throat ‐ exercises) for people with obstructive sleep apnoea 
Background 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleeping disorder. People with OSA have periods where their breathing stops during the night. OSA can cause snoring, unsatisfactory rest, daytime sleepiness, low energy or fatigue, tiredness, initial insomnia and morning headaches. 
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the first treatment option for most people with OSA. However, adherence to CPAP is often poor. A CPAP machine uses a hose and mask or nosepiece to deliver constant and steady air pressure. People who use CPAP often say that using the machine is uncomfortable, causes nasal congestion and abdominal bloating. They can feel claustrophobic and the machine is noisy. The noise can disturb bed partners. 
Myofunctional therapy teaches people to do daily exercises to strengthen their tongue and throat muscles. Myofunctional therapy may reduce the intensity of the OSA symptoms and reduce daytime sleepiness on its own, or combined with CPAP. 
Key results 
We found nine RCT studies that analysed a total of 347 participants, 69 of them women, and 13 children. 
In adults, compared to sham therapy, myofunctional therapy probably reduces daytime sleepiness, may increase sleep quality, may result in a large reduction in Apnoea‐Hypopnoea Index (the number of apneas or hypopnoeas recorded during the polysomnography study per hour of sleep), may have little to no effect in reduction of snoring frequency and probably reduces subjective snoring intensity slightly. 
Compared to waiting list, myofunctional therapy may reduce daytime sleepiness, may result in little to no difference in sleep quality and may reduce AHI. 
Compared to CPAP, myofunctional therapy may result in little to no difference in daytime sleepiness and may increase AHI. 
Compared to CPAP plus myofunctional therapy, myofunctional therapy alone may result in little to no difference in daytime sleepiness and may increase AHI. 
Compared to respiratory exercises plus nasal dilator strip, myofunctional therapy may result in little to no difference in daytime sleepiness, probably increases sleep quality slightly and may result in little to no difference in AHI. 
Compared to standard medical treatment, myofunctional therapy may reduce daytime sleepiness and may increase sleep quality. 
In children, compared to nasal washing alone, adding myofunctional therapy to nasal washing may result in little to no difference in AHI.
