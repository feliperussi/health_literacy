Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment.
