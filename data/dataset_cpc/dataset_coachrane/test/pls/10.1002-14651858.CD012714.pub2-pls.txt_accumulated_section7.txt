Medications for daytime sleepiness in individuals with idiopathic hypersomnia
Review questionWe reviewed the evidence for the effects of different medications on daytime sleepiness in people with idiopathic hypersomnia. 
BackgroundWe wanted to know which medications are helpful for treating people with idiopathic hypersomnia, a disease that causes severe daytime sleepiness, and can sometimes cause people to sleep for very long amounts of time and have difficulty waking up and thinking or concentrating. It is called 'idiopathic' hypersomnia because the cause or causes of the disease are currently unknown. We wanted to find out which medications help with daytime sleepiness and other symptoms of the disease. We looked for studies testing any medication for idiopathic hypersomnia compared to a placebo (dummy pill) or another treatment. 
Search dateThe evidence is current to February 2021. 
Study characteristicsWe identified three studies. Two studies tested modafinil, and one study tested clarithromycin. 
The two studies testing modafinil included a total of 102 people with idiopathic hypersomnia. Most of these people slept fewer than 10 hours per night. Both studies included people from multiple sleep clinics. One study took place in Germany, and the other in Japan. Both studies compared modafinil to placebo, lasted for three weeks, and were funded by pharmaceutical companies with commercial interest in the results of the studies. 
The study testing clarithromycin included a total of 20 participants, from a single sleep clinic in the USA, 10 of whom had idiopathic hypersomnia. We only included information for the 10 people with idiopathic hypersomnia in the review. This study compared clarithromycin to placebo. Although the study lasted five weeks, we only included information from the first two weeks. This study was funded by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Foundation, a charitable organization.
