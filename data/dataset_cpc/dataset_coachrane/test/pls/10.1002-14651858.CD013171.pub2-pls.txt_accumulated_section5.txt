Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in term and late preterm infants. 
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in term and late preterm infants (greater than 34 weeks' gestation (time between becoming pregnant and giving birth)) with or without pre‐existing liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: infants who need nutrition through an intravenous line (tube into a vein) have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based lipid emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based LEs may be harmful and may contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD) and other side effects. The newer LEs from other lipid sources including fish oil may potentially improve clinical outcomes in term and late preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: the review authors searched the medical literature and identified nine eligible studies (including 273 preterm infants). Evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: there is a paucity of research in this field with a limited number of studies, many of which were terminated early. There is very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve some liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease. However, this evidence was based on very limited number of participants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, so that no certain conclusions could be drawn. There was no evidence of benefit in other clinically important outcomes, for example, sepsis, rate of growth or death with any LE including fish oil‐LE over another LE in term and late preterm infants with surgical conditions or liver disease. We found no studies in infants without surgical conditions or pre‐existing liver disease.
