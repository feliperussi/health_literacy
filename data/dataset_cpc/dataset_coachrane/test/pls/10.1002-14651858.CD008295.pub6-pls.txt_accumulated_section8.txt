Felbamate used with other antiepileptic drugs for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
Background 
Up to 30% of people with epilepsy still suffer epileptic seizures despite trying multiple antiepileptic drugs, whether separately or in combination. These people are described as having drug‐resistant epilepsy. Drug resistance is most common in people with focal epilepsy (epilepsy that initially begins in one area of the brain, but can progress to affect the whole brain). Felbamate is an antiepileptic drug that might be effective for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy when used with other antiepileptic drugs. 
Aim of the review 
This review investigated whether felbamate is effective and tolerable for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, when used with other antiepileptic drugs (add‐on therapy). 
Results 
After searching the available literature, we found four trials, involving 236 participants, that investigated the use of felbamate in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. We included the four trials in the review. 
Although three of the trials reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency, they all reported very different results. One reported a 36% reduction in seizure frequency with felbamate, one reported only a 4% reduction with felbamate, and the other trial reported that there was no difference between felbamate and placebo (an inactive, dummy drug). We therefore found no clear evidence to suggest that felbamate was better than placebo at reducing seizure frequency for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. Additionally, there was mixed evidence about whether more people withdrew from treatment with felbamate or placebo. Notably, less than 10% of people in each trial withdrew from treatment when they were receiving felbamate, suggesting that felbamate may have good tolerability. The side effects that were reported by all four trials ‐ suggesting that they are the most common ‐ were headache, dizziness and nausea.
