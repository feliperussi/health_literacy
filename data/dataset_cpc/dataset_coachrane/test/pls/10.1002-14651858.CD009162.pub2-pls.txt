Aloe vera for prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis
Infusion phlebitis is acute inflammation of a vein in the presence of intravenous therapy. In modern medical practice, more than 80% of inpatients will receive intravenous therapy during their admission, and about 20% to 70% of them may develop infusion phlebitis. Therefore infusion phlebitis is the most common complication of intravenous therapy. However, routine treatments for prevention or treatment of phlebitis such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory. 
This review examined 35 randomised controlled trials and eight quasi‐randomised controlled trials with 7465 participants. Twenty‐two trials with 5546 participants were involved in looking at prevention of phlebitis with Aloe vera, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in looking at Aloe vera for the treatment of phlebitis. The included trials mainly compared external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or with another non‐Aloe vera treatment such as a wet compress of 75% alcohol or 33%, 50% or 75% MgSO4 with no treatment or the same non‐Aloe vera treatment. The duration of intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias. The incidence of phlebitis at varying degrees of severity as well as the resolution rate and level of improvement of phlebitis were investigated. 
The available evidence suggests that external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or combined with other non‐Aloe vera treatment may be effective for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis resulting from the intravenous therapy. The conclusions should be cautiously interpreted due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.
