Treatments for melasma (darker than normal skin occurring in patches)
Melasma is a psychologically distressing skin disorder also known as ‘chloasma’ or ‘mask of pregnancy’. Darker patches of skin gradually develop on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. It is more common in women and is associated with pregnancy and medication containing hormones. Melasma is divided into three types: epidermal, dermal, and mixed melasma. Epidermal melasma is the most superficial with an increase in the skin pigment (melanin) in the top layer of skin (epidermis). In dermal melasma, there is increased skin pigment in the second deeper layer of the skin (the dermis). Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma. 
Conventional treatments for melasma include sunscreens, bleaching creams (e.g. hydroquinone), acne creams (e.g. azelaic acid), topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin), and facial peels where an acid solution is used to remove outer layers of the skin (e.g. glycolic acid peels). Some treatments incorporate a combination approach such as triple‐combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid). There is inadequate information available at present to determine the best treatment for melasma. 
We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Triple‐combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma when compared to hydroquinone alone or to dual combinations such as tretinoin and hydroquinone, tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide, or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide. Tretinoin was more effective at lightening melasma compared to placebo, as was the skin‐whitening complex Thiospot. However, many studies were of a poor quality with a only small number of participants. 
The side‐effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin. No serious side‐effects were seen.
