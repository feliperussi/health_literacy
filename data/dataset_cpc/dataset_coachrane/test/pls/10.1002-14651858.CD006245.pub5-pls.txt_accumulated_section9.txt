Care delivery and self‐management strategies for children with epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a disorder that affects the nervous system of children and adults. Epileptic seizures (fits) are the result of excessive and abnormal activity in the brain, which are unpredictable in frequency. Most seizures are well controlled with medicines and other types of treatments, although epilepsy can cause problems in social, school, and work situations, making independent living difficult. People with seizures tend to have physical problems (e.g. fractures, bruising, and a slightly increased risk of sudden death) as well as social problems because of the stigma attached to the illness. People with epilepsy and their families may lack social support or experience social isolation, embarrassment, fear, and discrimination, and some parents of children with epilepsy may also feel guilty. Self‐management of epilepsy refers to a wide range of health behaviours and activities that a person can learn and adapt to control their seizures and improve their well‐being. This approach requires a partnership between the person and the providers of services (e.g. specialist epilepsy outpatient clinics, nurse‐based liaison services between family doctors and specialist hospital doctors, specialist epilepsy community teams), as well as targeted services for specific groups (e.g. children, teenagers, and families). 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for studies in children and adolescents with epilepsy that looked at the effects of self‐management of epilepsy. We wanted to look at several outcomes to see how well people with epilepsy and their families generally cope with the condition. 
Search date 
We included evidence published up to January 2020.
Key results 
This review compared seven education‐ or counselling‐based self‐management programmes for children and adolescents with epilepsy, plus one new way of delivering nursing care. Each strategy appeared to improve some of the outcomes studied, although no intervention improved all the outcomes that were measured. The studies also had problems with their methods, which made their results less reliable. Whilst none of the interventions caused any harm, their impact was limited. There is insufficient evidence to support any single strategy as the best one for children with epilepsy.
