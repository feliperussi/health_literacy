Home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors
Background 
The demands are growing for effective multidimensional survivorship programmes in women who have had breast cancer. This review was conducted to evaluate the effects of home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes on the quality of life in women who had completed primary treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) for breast cancer in the previous 10 years. 
Study characteristics 
We found 26 studies with 2272 participants receiving home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes compared with control. The content and delivery approach of the home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes were diverse among the included studies. The survivorship programme could incorporate any combination of at least two of the three identified components: educational (such as the provision of information and advice on how to self‐manage); physical (such as exercise or resistance training); and psychological (such as counselling and cognitive therapies). Most of the studies used usual care (routine medical follow‐up services) as a comparator. A few studies used a lower level or different type of intervention (e.g. stress management or exercise) or attention control as the comparator. 
The results revealed that home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes in breast cancer survivors appear to have a short‐term beneficial effect of improving quality of life. Several other studies examined the effects of home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes on symptoms and psychosocial outcomes. Those breast cancer survivors who received home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes showed a reduction in fatigue, insomnia and anxiety, but the effect was in the short term. There was no difference between groups with respect to symptoms of depression, flushes and night sweats. We found that a group‐based approach may be more effective than an individual‐based approach to deliver the home‐based multidimensional survivorship programmes. However, we found no evidence for a difference in quality of life with educational, psychological or physical components of the survivorship programmes. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence across studies for quality of life ranged from moderate to very low, meaning that in some cases we were fairly confident about the results (e.g. quality of life improvements) while in other cases we were uncertain about the results (e.g. reductions in fatigue, insomnia and anxiety).
