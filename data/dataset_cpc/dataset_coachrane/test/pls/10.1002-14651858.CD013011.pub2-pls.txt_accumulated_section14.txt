IR methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults
What is the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of treating adults with ADHD with a stimulant drug called immediate‐release (IR) methylphenidate. 
Key messages 
Compared with placebo (a dummy pill), IR methylphenidate may promote a small reduction in the symptoms of ADHD and may increase the doctor’s perception of an improvement in symptoms. IR methylphenidate increased the risk of adverse effects such as loss of appetite, dry mouth, nausea and stomach aches. 
Compared with lithium (a drug to treat overactivity and excitement), IR methylphenidate may promote few or no changes in the symptoms of ADHD, anxiety and depression. 
These results are uncertain, and we do not know if we can trust them.
What was studied in this review? 
ADHD is a mental‐health impairment. The problem is diagnosed in adults who show signs of inattention (e.g. trouble concentrating), hyperactivity (e.g. unable to sit still) and impulsivity (e.g. doing things without thinking). 
We looked for trials comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with other drugs (including extended‐release formulations of methylphenidate where the drug is released slowly over time) or placebo, to treat ADHD in adults. We wanted to know the effect of IR methylphenidate on the symptoms of ADHD and if people had adverse events. We also wanted to know if people treated with the drug or their doctors perceived changes in their symptoms (getting worse or better), mental health (depression, anxiety) or quality of life. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 trials, involving 497 adults. Three trials were carried out in Europe and one in Argentina; the remaining trials did not report their location. Six trials compared IR methylphenidate with placebo. In the other trials, IR methylphenidate was compared to an extended‐release form of bupropion (an antidepressant), lithium, an extended‐release form of methylphenidate named osmotic‐release oral system (OROS), and Pycnogenol® (a medicine derived from the bark of a pine tree). People were treated for 6 to 18 weeks. Participants were mainly outpatients; some participants were inpatients for addiction treatment, or individuals willing to attend an intensive outpatient program for cocaine dependence. 
IR methylphenidate versus placebo 
One trial with 146 participants reported that IR methylphenidate may reduce symptoms of ADHD when judged by the doctors. When participants judge their own symptoms, there may be a moderate positive effect. We are however uncertain about these results and they may change with the addition of more data. IR methylphenidate appears to have little or no effect in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. We have concerns about the methods and conflicts of interest presented by this trial and the other nine trials that were evaluated.
