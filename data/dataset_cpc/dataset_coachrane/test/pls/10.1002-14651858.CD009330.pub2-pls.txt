Prolonged storage of packed red blood cells (storage of 21 days or more) in comparison with fresh cells on recipients of blood transfusion 
Review question 
We reviewed the clinical benefits and harms of prolonged storage of packed red blood cells (storage of 21 days or more) in comparison with the use of fresher packed red blood cells on recipients of blood transfusion. 
Background 
Blood transfusion is used to try to solve life‐ and health‐threatening conditions on a short‐term basis. Packed red blood cells are most often used for blood transfusion. Sometimes blood is transfused after prolonged storage of these cells but there is continuing debate as to whether transfusion of 'older' blood is as beneficial as transfusion of 'fresher' blood. 
Study characteristics 
We identified three studies, involving a total of 120 participants, comparing packed red blood cells stored for ≥ 21 days versus < 21 days. 
Key results 
The results of the studies for the outcome death from any cause were uncertain due to the small number of participants who contributed information. We could not exclude an effect on death with either longer or shorter storage. None of the trials considered the other outcomes of interest in this review, namely transfusion‐related acute lung injury, postoperative infections, and adverse events. The safety profiles of the two approaches are unknown. 
Quality of evidence 
The level of confidence in the results of this review is very low. The studies have limitations in the way they were designed and executed. Moreover, the limited number of people included in the studies led to imprecise results. We are aware of four large ongoing trials in this area which will help us to better understand the effects of storage on red blood cells in relation to outcomes for patients.
