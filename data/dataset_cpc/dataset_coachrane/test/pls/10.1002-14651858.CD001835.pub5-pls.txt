Surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms that do not cause symptoms
Background 
An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery (blood vessel), which, in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), occurs in the major artery in the abdomen (aorta). Ruptured AAAs cause death unless surgical repair is rapid, which is difficult to achieve. Surgery is recommended for people with aneurysms bigger than 5.5 cm in diameter or who have associated pain, to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of rupture and death. However, there are risks with surgery. Surgical repair consists of re‐lining the aorta with strong synthetic material, either by open surgery or endovascular repair (a minimally invasive keyhole procedure). Small asymptomatic (no symptoms) AAAs are at low risk of rupture and are monitored through regular imaging so they can be surgically repaired if they grow. 
Key results 
We found four well‐conducted trials that randomised 3314 participants with small (diameter 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm) asymptomatic AAAs to early repair or regular, routine ultrasounds to check for aneurysm growth (surveillance) (search current to 10 July 2019). In the surveillance group, the aneurysm was repaired if it was enlarging, reached 5.5 cm in diameter, or became symptomatic. The trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group because of the number of deaths within 30 days of surgery (operative mortality). The trials found no difference in long‐term survival between early repair (open or endovascular) and surveillance over three to eight years of follow‐up. After three years, about 31% of the participants randomised to surveillance eventually had the aneurysm repaired, rising to 75% after 12 years. 
Two trials reported costs. For the first 18 months, costs were lower with surveillance than either open repair or endovascular repair. After four years, one trial found similar total medical costs for early endovascular repair and surveillance groups. After 12 years, another trial found lower hospital costs with surveillance than with open repair. 
The four studies used different ways to measure quality of life and results were conflicting. The percentage of aneurysm ruptures in the surveillance group appeared higher in the trials using open repair but these have not restricted participants to those with aortic anatomy suitable for endovascular repair. Most ruptures were in people whose previous aneurysm diameter exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The methods within the studies using open repair were good and the reliability of the evidence was high to moderate for the two trials comparing open repair with surveillance. For the two trials comparing endovascular repair with surveillance, the risk of bias was unclear to high and the reliability of the evidence was low. The four trials suggest no overall advantage with early surgery for small AAAs (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm). The two trials comparing early open surgical repair to surveillance found this result holds true regardless of patient age or aneurysm size (within the range of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter). Furthermore, the two trials that focused on endovascular repair, also found no benefit over surveillance. Neither early open nor early endovascular repair of small AAAs is supported by the current evidence.
