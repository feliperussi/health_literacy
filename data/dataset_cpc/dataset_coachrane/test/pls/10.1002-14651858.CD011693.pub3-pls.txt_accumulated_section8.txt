What are the benefits and risks of minimally invasive (Trabectome) surgery for treating glaucoma (a common eye condition)? 
Why is this question important?Glaucoma is a common eye condition that affects the optic nerve. It can occur in people of all ages but is most common in adults over 70 years of age. 
There are several different types of glaucoma. The most common is ‘primary open‐angle glaucoma’. This tends to develop slowly over many years. It is caused by abnormally high pressure in the eye that develops when the eye’s drainage system does not work properly and fluid builds up in the eye. This increased pressure damages the optic nerve and can cause partial – or even total – blindness. 
Several different treatments are available for glaucoma. These include eye drops, laser treatment, and surgery. Surgery is usually used only if treatment with eye drops or laser has not worked. 
Standard surgery usually involves removing part of the drainage tubes in the eye to allow fluid to drain more easily. It may be performed under local anaesthetic (while the patient is awake) or under general anaesthetic (while the patient is asleep). Standard surgery often leads to complications (such as bleeding in the eye during and after surgery), and people may need the operation to be repeated. 
One possible alternative to standard surgical procedures is Trabectome surgery. Trabectome surgery is performed under local anaesthetic and involves using a specially designed instrument (a Trabectome) to remove a portion of tissue to improve the eye’s drainage pathway. Surgeons make a smaller incision in the eye than in standard surgery, and this could lead to fewer risks for the patient. 
To find out about the benefits and risks of Trabectome surgery, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence‐based on factors such as study methods and sizes and the consistency of findings across studies.
