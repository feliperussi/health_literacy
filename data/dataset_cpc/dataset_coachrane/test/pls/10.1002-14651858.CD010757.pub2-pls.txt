Follow‐up strategies for women following treatment for CIN: Impact of HPV testing
Background 
It is widely accepted that infection with high‐risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is associated with development of precancerous changes, namely, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. It is also accepted that women who develop high‐grade CIN and subsequently receive treatment with a procedure called large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), which uses a wire loop to remove abnormal cells, are at greater risk for developing further CIN than women who have never had CIN. Therefore, these women need regular follow‐up assessment to detect additional abnormalities. 
Main findings 
We searched for randomised control trials (RCTs) that compared follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment for CIN. We checked 1348 titles and abstracts of potentially relevant references, but we identified no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. We identified trials of interest, but they were deemed not relevant because of their focus on diagnostic outcomes and examination of how sensitive tests are, rather than on the effects of different follow‐up strategies on long‐term outcomes. Currently no evidence indicates whether hrHPV post‐treatment testing is better or worse in terms of important long‐term clinical outcomes. This review highlights the need for good quality trials in this area that do not focus solely on the diagnostic accuracy of testing. 
Conclusion 
We found no evidence from RCTs to inform decisions about the best surveillance strategy following treatment for CIN. A prognostic systematic review is needed to investigate the risks and benefits of different follow‐up strategies for women after LLETZ treatment.
