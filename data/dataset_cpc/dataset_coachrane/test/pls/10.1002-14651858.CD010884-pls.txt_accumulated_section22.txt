Resistance training (such as weight‐lifting) for fibromyalgia
Research question 
What are the effects of resistance exercise training for people with fibromyalgia on wellness, symptoms, fitness, and adverse effects? 
Background 
What problems does fibromyalgia cause? People with fibromyalgia have chronic, widespread body pain, and often have fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression and problems sleeping. 
What is resistance training? Resistance training is exercise that involves lifting weights, or using machines or elastic bands that provide resistance to movement. 
‐ This review only looked at resistance training programs supervised by a trained professional. 
‐ We compared resistance training to no exercise and to other types of exercise.
Study characteristics 
After looking for all related studies in March 2013, we found 5 studies with 219 women with fibromyalgia. Ninety‐five (95) of these women did resistance training. 
Only three studies looked at wellness, symptoms, and fitness in 54 women with fibromyalgia who did resistance training and 53 women with fibromyalgia who did not do resistance training. 
The 54 women with fibromyalgia who did resistance training:
‐ did supervised resistance training sessions using exercise equipment, free weights, and body weight 
‐ exercised 2 to 3 times a week
‐ exercised for 16 to 21 weeks.
Key results: what happened to women with fibromyalgia who took part in resistance training for 16 to 21 weeks compared to those who did not do resistance training during this time period? 
Overall well‐being (multidimensional function) on a scale of 0 to 100 units 
Women who did resistance training rated their well‐being 25 units better while women who did not do resistance training rated their well‐being 8 units better. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training rated their well‐being 17 units better at the end of the studies than those who did not do resistance training. 
Physical function (ability to do normal activities) on a scale of 0 to 100 units 
Women who did resistance training rated their ability to do normal activities 8 units better while women who did not do resistance training rated their ability to do normal activities 2 units better. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training rated their ability to function 6 units better at the end of the studies than women who did not do resistance training.
