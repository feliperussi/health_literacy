Topical antibiotics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if topical antibiotics are effective in treating chronic suppurative otitis media and whether one type of topical antibiotic treatment is more effective than any other. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Key messages 
There is a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not topical antibiotics improve the resolution of ear discharge in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). However, among this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic (oral or injected). There is also lots of uncertainty about which type of topical antibiotic is the most effective. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
What was studied in the review? 
Chronic suppurative otitis media, sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a long‐term (chronic) swelling and infection of the middle ear, with ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane (eardrum). The main symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics (administered into the ear canal as ear drops, ointments, sprays or creams) are the most commonly used treatment for CSOM. Topical antibiotics kill or stop the growth of the micro‐organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Topical antibiotics can be used on their own or added to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting) or systemic antibiotics (antibiotics taken either by mouth or by an injection into a muscle or vein). It was important in this review to examine whether there were any adverse effects from using topical antibiotics as they can cause irritation of the skin within the outer ear, which may cause discomfort, pain or itching. This review also examined whether different types of antibiotics were more effective at treating CSOM than others, as some antibiotics (such as aminoglycosides) may have the potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with potential to cause irreparable hearing loss (sensorineural), dizziness or ringing in the ear (tinnitus).
