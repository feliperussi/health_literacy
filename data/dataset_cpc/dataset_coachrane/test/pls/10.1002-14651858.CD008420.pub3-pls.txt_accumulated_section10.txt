Endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy
Review question 
We compared the benefits and harms of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and endothelial keratoplasty (EK) in people with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) to determine whether one is more effective or safer than the other. 
Background 
The innermost layer (endothelial cell layer) of the cornea (transparent front of the eye) is essential for maintaining corneal transparency by pumping fluid out and preventing swelling, which leads to opacification. FED is a disease caused by premature degeneration of the endothelial cells leading to fluid in the cornea (oedema), blisters on the surface of the eye (bullous keratopathy) and blurred vision. Severe cases can be treated by corneal transplants, which can be broadly classified into the two types of procedures of PKP (the central cornea is replaced using full thickness corneal tissue from a deceased donor) and EK (where only the innermost layer of the cornea is transplanted). 
The EK procedure can be performed using several methods such as deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK), Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) or femtosecond laser‚Äêassisted endothelial keratoplasty (FLEK). 
Study characteristics 
We found three randomised controlled trials that compared EK with PKP, one of which used the FLEK method. The evidence was current to January 2014. The three trials enrolled a total of 139 eyes of 136 participants, of which 123 eyes were included in the final analyses. The trial on FLEK and PKP was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in the Netherlands; the other two trials were conducted in the United States and were reported in 2008 and 2009 but the study dates were not specified. Over 70% of the included participants were diagnosed with FED, and the remaining participants had other ocular conditions. 
Key results 
There was no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between the two groups in one study at 12 months and another at 24 months. Chances of having an irregular shape of the front of the cornea (astigmatism) was less but endothelial cell loss was higher following EK procedures than after PKP. Only one trial reported harms of the interventions, and indicated that FLEK may result in slightly more complications than PKP (for example, 8% graft failure in the FLEK group versus none in the PKP group; and 3% graft rejection in the FLEK group versus 2% in the PKP group). No trials reported information about quality of life or economic data.
