Video feedback for parental sensitivity and child attachment
Background 
Children who are securely attached to at least one parent are able to be comforted by that parent when they are distressed and more able to explore the world confidently by using that parent as a 'secure base'. Research suggests that a secure attachment enables children to function better across all aspects of their development. Promoting secure attachment, therefore, is a goal of many programmes that aim to support children and families in the first few years of the child's life. Video feedback involves showing a parent brief moments of videotaped interaction between them and their baby, in order to strengthen their sensitivity to signals from their baby, with the aim of improving attachment. 
Review question 
To assess the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity and attachment security in children under five years old who are at risk of poor outcomes, compared to no intervention (no treatment), a mock treatment (such as a phone call) or treatment as usual. 
Included studies 
This review included 22 studies, made up of 1889 randomised parent‐child pairs or family units. Not all of these could be combined in a meta‐analysis (a statistical method of combining data from several studies to reach a single, more robust conclusion). We combined data from 20 studies (made up of 1757 parent‐child pairs) to examine the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity. We combined data from fewer studies to look at attachment security, parental stress, parental anxiety and child behaviour. 
The included studies were mostly conducted in Canada, the Netherlands, UK and USA. Single studies were conducted in Italy, Germany, Lithuania, Norway and Portugal. 
Almost all studies reported some form of external funding, from either a charitable organisation (n = 7) and/or public body (n = 18). 
Results 
The results show evidence of an improvement in parental sensitivity following the use of video feedback. The results for attachment security were mixed: one meta‐analysis showed that the intervention group were more securely attached, while the second meta‐analysis, which measured the strength of attachment in a different way, showed no evidence of impact. There was no evidence of impact on parental anxiety or stress. No studies measured parental reflective functioning. There was no evidence of impact on child behaviour. 
Study certainty 
We rated the overall certainty of the evidence (the extent to which we believe that the results are correct or adequate) as moderate for parental sensitivity, and low or very low for the other outcomes. This means that we are reasonably certain that video feedback improves parental sensitivity in the short term, but we are not very certain of its impact on our other findings.
