Colchicine for treating acute gout flares
Background 
Gout is a very common cause of inflammatory arthritis (pain, redness, warmth and swelling of affected joints) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. Uric acid is a normal waste product that is usually excreted with urine. However, in the case of gout, there is either excessive production of uric acid, or the body is not able to excrete it quickly enough, or a combination of both. An attack of gout usually occurs rapidly and usually resolves within 7 to 10 days. 
Colchicine is a drug that is used mainly in gout to treat an acute attack or to prevent an attack while starting uric acid‐lowering therapy. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to August 2020. We included four trials (803 randomised participants) in this updated review, including two new trials. One three‐arm trial compared high‐dose colchicine (52 participants), low‐dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (fake medicine) (59 participants); one trial compared high‐dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low‐dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti‐gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We selected low‐dose colchicine compared with placebo as the primary comparison; the low dose is consistent with doses used in practice. Trials were performed in hospital and multicentre settings in four countries, the majority of participants were male, and mean age ranged between 51.2 and 70 years. One trial received funding from a pharmaceutical company that was involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript writing. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo medication, low‐dose colchicine for people with acute gout may slightly improve treatment outcomes with little or no increased risk of adverse events at 32 to 36 hours.
