Surgery or radiological treatment for varicoceles in subfertile men
Background 
A varicocele is a dilatation (enlargement) of the veins along the spermatic cord (the cord suspending the testis) in the scrotum. Dilatation occurs when valves within the veins along the spermatic cord fail and allow retrograde blood flow, causing a backup of blood. Surgical treatment involves the closing off of the vessels, typically with sutures or clips. Radiological treatment involves both embolisation, in which the vessel is blocked with small particles, or sclerotherapy, where an agent is administered that damages the vessels, causing them to shrink. The mechanisms by which varicocelesÂ might affect fertility, or the mechanisms by which surgical or radiological treatment of varicoceles might restore fertility, have not yet been explained. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the effect of varicocele treatment on live birth, adverse events, pregnancy rate, varicocele recurrence, and quality of life in subfertile couples where the male has a varicocele, and the female partner of childbearing age has no fertility problems. 
Study characteristics 
We found 48 randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing treatment versus no treatment or versus a different treatment method in a total of 5384 men. The evidence is current to April 2020. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether surgical or radiological treatment improves live birth rates when compared to no treatment. Treatment may improve pregnancy rates compared to delayed or no treatment. The evidence suggests that couples with no or delayed treatment have a 21% chance of pregnancy, whilst the pregnancy rate after surgical or radiological treatment is between 22% and 48%. Data were lacking on adverse events, varicocele recurrence, and quality of life. 
We are uncertain about the effect of surgical versus radiological treatment on live birth, pregnancy rate, varicocele recurrence, and the adverse event hydrocele formation. Data were lacking on quality of life for this comparison. 
Microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment probably improves pregnancy rates slightly compared to other surgical treatments. This suggests that couples with microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment have a 10% to 14% chance of pregnancy after treatment, whilst the pregnancy rate in couples after other surgical treatments is 10%. This procedure also probably reduces the risk of varicocele recurrence. This suggests that 0.4% to 1.1% of men undergoing microscopic subinguinal surgical treatment experience recurrent varicocele, whilst 1.4% of men undergoing other surgical treatments do. Results on adverse events were inconclusive. Data were lacking on live birth and quality of life. 
We are uncertain about the effects of open inguinal surgical treatment versus retroperitoneal surgical treatment on adverse events, pregnancy rates, or varicocele recurrence. Data were lacking on live birth and quality of life.
