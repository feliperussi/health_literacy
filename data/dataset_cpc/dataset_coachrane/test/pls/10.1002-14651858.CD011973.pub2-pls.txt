Beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal varices in children 
Background 
Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins (a type of blood vessel) called the portal venous system. This system drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and spleen into the liver. Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage (bleeding) from oesophageal (gullet) and gastrointestinal varices (enlarged or swollen veins) in the tube that connects the throat and stomach (the oesophagus) and the digestive tract. Portal vein thrombosis (a vascular disease of the liver) occurs when a blood clot lodges in the hepatic portal vein. Portal vein thrombosis results in portal hypertension leading among others to the formation of varices (e.g. oesophageal or gastric). 
In adults, numerous randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) have demonstrated benefits of medicines called non‐selective beta‐blockers in decreasing the risk of first variceal haemorrhage. These preventive interventions have become the established standard in adults. However, it is unknown whether the preventive interventions are of benefit or cause harm when used in children and adolescents. 
AimsWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for the prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We searched for trials until April 2020. 
Key resultsWe found no randomised clinical trials to include in this systematic review. Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether beta‐blockers, when compared to placebo or no intervention, may be beneficial or not for children with oesophageal varices. There is a need for well‐designed and sufficiently large randomised clinical trials that include important clinical outcomes, such as death, quality of life, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events.
