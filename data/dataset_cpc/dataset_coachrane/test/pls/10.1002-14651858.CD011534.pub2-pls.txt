Pain relievers for children with acute middle ear infection
Review question 
We wanted to find out if pain relievers are effective for relieving pain in children with acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media (AOM)) and which medications, alone or together, provide the most effective pain relief. 
Background 
Acute middle ear infection or AOM is one of the most common childhood infections. Ear pain due to middle ear infection and pressure building up behind the eardrum is the key symptom of AOM and central to children's and parents' experience of the illness. Because antibiotics provide only marginal benefits, pain relievers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the cornerstone of AOM management in children.

Study characteristics 
We included data from three trials of low to moderate risk of bias of 327 children with AOM. One trial (219 children) compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus a dummy drug in children with AOM. In this trial, all children also received antibiotic treatment and those with fever > 39 °C may have received paracetamol in addition to the studied treatments. Two other trials compared the effects of paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol in children with fever and patients with respiratory tract infections, respectively. The authors of these two trials provided crude subgroup data on children with AOM (26 and 82 children, respectively). 
Study funding sources 
In one trial, paracetamol, ibuprofen and a dummy drug were supplied by a pharmaceutical company (Ethypharm). No further details were provided about the role of this company in the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of the trial. The other two trials were funded by governmental (non‐commercial) grants. In one trial the drugs were purchased from and provided by two companies (Pfizer and DHP Investigational Medicinal Products) which had no role in the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of the trial. 
Key results 
Very limited information was available to assess how useful painkillers are for relieving children's pain due to AOM. We found that both paracetamol and ibuprofen when used alone were more effective than a dummy drug in relieving ear pain at 48 hours (25% of children receiving a dummy drug had residual pain at 48 hours versus 10% in the paracetamol group and 7% in the ibuprofen group). The adverse events reported in the trials did not significantly differ between children treated with either paracetamol, ibuprofen or dummy drug, but this finding should be interpreted cautiously, given there were few participants, and infrequent occurrence of adverse events. We found insufficient evidence of a difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen in relieving short‐term (at 24 hours, 48 to 72 hours and 4 to 7 days) ear pain in children with AOM. We could not draw any firm conclusions on the effects of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone in relieving ear pain in children with AOM mainly because of the very limited number of participants (very small sample size). 
Quality of evidence 
Evidence quality for ear pain relief at 48 hours for the comparisons paracetamol versus a dummy drug and ibuprofen versus a dummy drug was judged low (study limitations and questions about the applicability of evidence affected our confidence in the results); the quality of evidence for adverse events was judged very low (study limitations, small sample size and infrequent occurrence of adverse events affected our confidence in the results). 
Evidence quality for ear pain relief at 48 to 72 hours for the comparison ibuprofen versus paracetamol was judged low (study limitations and questions about the applicability of evidence affected our confidence in the results); the quality of evidence for ear pain relief at 24 hours and four to seven days was judged very low (study limitations and very small sample size affected our confidence in the results). 
Evidence quality for all outcomes in the trials comparing ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone was very low (study limitations and very small sample size affected our confidence in the results).
