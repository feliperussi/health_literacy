Endometrial preparation for egg donor recipients or for frozen embryo transfers
Review question 
What is the most effective method for endometrial preparation in women undergoing embryo transfers with frozen embryos or embryos derived from donor oocytes? 
Background 
Couples undergo infertility treatments due to male factor, female factors or unexplained infertility. After an unsuccessful fresh embryo transfer cycle, a frozen‐thawed embryo transfer can be performed when frozen embryos are available. Adequate hormonal preparation of the endometrium is of utmost importance for both egg donor and frozen embryo replacement cycles to provide the optimal chances of pregnancy. Many drugs and various modes of administration have been tried by several investigators in order to optimise implantation rates and consequently improve the success rates of the embryo transfer procedures: stimulated cycles (to generate endogenous oestradiol), programmed cycles (administering exogenous oestradiol) or natural cycles (allowing the ovaries to produce oestradiol without stimulation) are some of the options; avoiding spontaneous ovulation with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists could have some impact; or using some other drugs such as aspirin or steroids that could potentially enhance the endometrial receptivity were also evaluated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 randomised controlled trials comparing different interventions such as the dose and route of administration of oestrogens and progestogen, the use of drugs that stop the patient from ovulating prematurely (GnRH agonists), and the use of other medications to improve the endometrium in a total of 5426 women. The evidence is current to June 2020. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether a stimulated cycle (with letrozole) compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves live birth. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following a programmed cycle is assumed to be 24%, the chance following a stimulated cycle would be between 13% and 51%. We are also uncertain of the impact on miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness. A stimulated cycle may improve clinical pregnancy rate. Data were lacking on multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation and other adverse effects. 
We are uncertain whether a natural cycle improves the live birth rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness in comparison with a programmed cycle. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are uncertain if transdermal (delivered via the skin) oestrogens compared with oral (by mouth) oestrogens improve clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes in this comparison. 
Starting progestogen on the day of the donor oocyte retrieval or the day after probably increases the clinical pregnancy rate and probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate. We are uncertain if it reduces the miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
A cycle with GnRH agonist compared to without may improve live birth rate. We are uncertain of the effect of a GnRH cycle compared to no GnRH for the outcomes of clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and endometrial thickness. No study reported on the other outcomes for this comparison. 
We are uncertain if any GnRH agonist is better than other: a cycle with daily leuprolide or with deposit tryptorelin improves clinical pregnancy rate, or if daily acetate leuprolide or daily nafarelin reduces the miscarriage rate. Other outcomes were not reported. 
GnRH antagonists compared to agonists probably improve clinical pregnancy rate. We are uncertain of the effect on miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. No study reported the other outcomes. 
We are uncertain whether a cycle with aspirin compared to a cycle without improves live birth, clinical pregnancy rate or endometrial thickness. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are also uncertain whether a cycle with steroids compared to a cycle without steroids improves live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. No study reported on the other outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate to very low‐quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, and lack of precision in the findings for live birth.
