Does the use of antimicrobial mouthwash or nasal spray by people who are not actively suspected of having COVID‐19 ‐ or by their healthcare workers ‐ protect their healthcare workers when they undertake 'aerosol‐generating procedures' on them? 
Why is this question important? 
COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Most people infected with COVID‐19 develop a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection). Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care. 
COVID‐19 spreads from person to person primarily through droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. A person can also become infected by touching a surface or object that has viral droplets on it, and then touching their own mouth or nose. 
Some people with COVID‐19 do not have any symptoms, therefore they might not be known to be or suspected of being infected. However, they might still be able to pass the infection on to others. This means that healthcare workers who are treating them may be at risk of catching the infection. Risk of infection may be particularly high when healthcare workers undertake 'aerosol‐generating procedures', which are medical procedures that cause the patient to produce many small droplets. For example, people who have surgery under general anaesthesia, or people with a lung disease that makes breathing difficult (such as pneumonia), may need to be placed on a ventilator (artificial breathing machine) to help them breathe. This requires a healthcare worker to insert a tube through the patient's mouth, into their airway – a procedure during which many small droplets are likely to be produced by the patient. Similar droplets can be produced during routine dental procedures, such as drilling or scaling of teeth. 
Patient or healthcare worker use of antimicrobial mouthwash (to rinse the mouth) or nasal spray (sprayed into the nose) might help to protect healthcare workers against infection by COVID‐19. Antimicrobial mouthwash and nasal spray are liquids that kill or stop the growth of micro‐organisms such as viruses or bacteria. 
As with any medical treatment, antimicrobial mouthwash and nasal spray have potential risks as well as benefits. It is possible that using mouthwash or nasal spray could cause a variety of unwanted (adverse) effects, including irritation, allergic reactions or loss of smell. It may also remove micro‐organisms from the mouth or nose that are useful for protecting the body against infection. 
We set out to assess the benefits and risks of self‐administration of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays by patients without a known or suspected COVID‐19 infection, or the healthcare workers who treat them with aerosol‐generating procedures, by reviewing the research evidence. 
How did we search for evidence? 
Our team of researchers searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of patients or healthcare workers self‐administering any antimicrobial mouthwash or nasal spray against using no treatment, water or a salt solution.
