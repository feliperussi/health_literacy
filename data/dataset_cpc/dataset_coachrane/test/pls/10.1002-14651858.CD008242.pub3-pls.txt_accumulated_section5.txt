Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults
Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves, and can have a variety of different names. Some of the more common are painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or post‚Äêstroke pain. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines to those used for pain from damaged tissue. Medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen are not usually effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. 
Amitriptyline is an antidepressant, and antidepressants are widely recommended for treating neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain conditions, but an earlier review found no good quality evidence to support its use. Most studies were small, relatively old, and used methods or reported results that we now recognise as making benefits seem better than they are. 
In March 2015 we performed searches to look for new studies in adults with neuropathic pain of at least moderate intensity. We found only two additional small studies that did not provide any good quality evidence for either benefit or harm. This is disappointing, but we can still make useful comments about the drug. 
Amitriptyline probably does not work in neuropathic pain associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or treatments for cancer. Amitriptyline probably does work in other types of neuropathic pain, though we cannot be certain of this. Our best guess is that amitriptyline provides pain relief in about 1 in 4 (25%) more people than does placebo, and about 1 in 4 (25%) more people than placebo report having at least one adverse event, which may be troublesome, but probably not serious. We cannot trust either figure based on the information available.
