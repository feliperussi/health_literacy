Uncoated balloon angioplasty versus drug‐eluting balloon angioplasty for peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs 
Background 
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is a widespread condition that affects many people. In its advanced form, PAD can lead to pain, infections, and amputation. People with PAD are usually first treated with medicines and lifestyle modifications including strategies to stop smoking and a walking program to optimize their general health. People who require an operation might have a traditional open surgery or a less invasive procedure known as angioplasty, which uses a balloon to open the blockages in the arteries. A new type of angioplasty, known as drug‐eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty, has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with PAD. By using DEBs to balloon and coat the inside of the blood vessels (tubes that carry blood around the body) with medicines to treat cancer (chemotherapy) such as paclitaxel, the hope is to halt the progression of PAD and prevent or postpone its devastating complications. The goal of this review was to determine how DEB angioplasty compares with traditional balloon angioplasty for the treatment of PAD of the lower limbs. 
Study characteristics and key results 
Our review included 11 clinical trials that randomized 1838 participants (current until December 2015). The trials included thigh and leg arteries above and below the knee. The trials were carried out in Europe and the USA, and all used DEBs that contained paclitaxel. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices: Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic. Most participants were followed for 12 or more months (called follow‐up). At six and 12 months of follow‐up, DEBs were associated with improved primary vessel patency, which is an indicator of whether a vessel is still patent without any further interventions (blood flowing well), late lumen loss, which is the difference in millimeters between the angioplastied segment and how narrow it is on follow‐up, target lesion revascularization, which is an indicator of whether a person received more than one treatment to the same artery during the period covered by the study, and binary restenosis, which occurs when a treated artery becomes narrowed again after being previously treated. 
Unfortunately, early anatomic (structural) advantages of DEBs were not accompanied by improvements in quality of life, functional walking ability, or in the occurrence of amputation or death. When we specifically examined arteries below the knee and people who had very advanced PAD, we found no clinical or angiographic advantage for DEBs at 12 months of follow‐up compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. In summary, DEBs have several anatomic advantages over uncoated balloons for the treatment of lower limb PAD for up to 12 months after undergoing the procedure. However, more data are needed to assess the long‐term results of this treatment option adequately. 
Quality of the evidence 
All the trials had differences in the way in which they inserted the balloons, and in the type and duration of additional antiplatelet (anticlotting) therapy, leading to downgrading of the quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence presented was moderate for target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category (a way of classifying PAD), and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle‐brachial index (which is used to predict the severity of PAD).
