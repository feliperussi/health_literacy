Use of gloves, a gown or a mask for contact with hospitalised patients with Staphylococcus aureus resistant to a common antibiotic (MRSA) 
What is MRSA, and why is it a problem in hospitals? 
MRSA stands for 'meticillin‐ (or methicillin‐) resistant Staphylococcus aureus'. This is a common type of bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) that is no longer killed by meticillin (also known as 'methicillin', an antibiotic) or other antibiotics that are frequently used to treat infections. MRSA can live on people without making them ill, and without them showing any symptoms, but is dangerous when it infects people who are unwell. 
MRSA is easily transferred from one patient to another in hospitals, where it causes severe infections and can cause death. This transmission occurs mainly through healthcare workers when their hands, clothes, or equipment become contaminated with MRSA during routine care of patients who have MRSA. Later contact of the contaminated hands, clothes or equipment with other patients allows MRSA to spread within the hospital. 
Why might use of gloves, gowns or masks help prevent transmission of MRSA between patients in hospitals? 
It is possible that the use of disposable gloves with or without the use of disposable or washable gowns could prevent transmission of MRSA, as they would protect the healthcare workers' hands and clothes from becoming contaminated with MRSA. The gloves and gowns would be discarded after one patient had been cared for, and clean ones used to visit the next patient. The use of masks might also prevent spread of MRSA through the air. 
It is not known whether use of gloves, gowns or masks reduces the spread of MRSA when they are used individually, or whether combining two of the three, or all three, produces better results. 
The aim of this research and what the researchers found 
The researchers aimed to find out whether the use of gloves, a gown or a mask by any person in the hospital (for example, a doctor) getting close to a patient found to have MRSA prevents the transmission of MRSA from this patient to other people in the hospital. 
The researchers made a wide search of the medical literature, up to June 2015, but did not find any rigorous studies that addressed this topic. 
At present there is no scientific evidence that the wearing of gloves, a gown, or a mask by people getting close to patients with MRSA reduces the transmission of MRSA to other people in the hospital. However, this should not be interpreted as demonstrating that gloves, gowns or masks are not effective; it means that the research that would be required to measure an effect ‐ if there is one ‐ has not been done yet.
