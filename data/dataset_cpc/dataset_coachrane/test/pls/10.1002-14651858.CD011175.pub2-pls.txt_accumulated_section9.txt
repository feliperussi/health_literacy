Interventions for patients and caregivers to improve knowledge of sickle cell disease and recognition of its related complications 
Review question 
We wished to determine if any educational interventions have helped people with sickle cell disease and their caregivers to improve their understanding of the disease, recognize its complications, improve their adherence to treatment, affect how they utilize healthcare and improve other social and psychological problems that they might face. 
Background 
Sickle cell disease is a lifelong, inherited disorder which can cause a number of complications throughout an individual's life. It may cause a huge burden on both the patient and their family, including frequent visits to healthcare facilities. The illness causes not just physical complications such as painful crises and strokes, but may have many other effects such as depression, poor quality of life, coping issues and poor family relationships. When people with a chronic illness have better understanding about their illness, they manage their illness better and improve their quality of life. We wish to compare effects of different interventions as well as individual interventions to no intervention.

Study characteristics 
The review included 12 trials (563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal aged six to 35 years). Participants were assigned randomly to either educational programs, no program and in some cases to a non‐educational program, e.g. art therapy. Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and post‐intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion.
