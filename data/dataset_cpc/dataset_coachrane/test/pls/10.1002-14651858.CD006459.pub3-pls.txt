Ultrasound guidance for upper and lower limb blocks
Background 
Nerve blocks are used to numb all or part of the arms or legs (peripheral blockade) for surgery, or to provide pain relief after the operation, or both. Using ultrasound, anaesthetists can 'see' vital structures below the skin, which should allow them to place the local anaesthetic injection accurately and avoid damaging other tissues or organs. We aimed to assess whether ultrasound has any advantages over other nerve‚Äêlocating techniques for nerve blocks of the arms or legs in adults. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current up to 27 August 2014. We found 32 studies with 2844 participants. Most studies compared ultrasound with electrical nerve stimulators or compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulators against nerve stimulators alone. We reran the search in May 2015. We will deal with the 11 studies of interest when we next update the review. 
Key results 
We combined the results of studies using statistical tests and found that nerve blocks were more likely to be assessed as adequate for surgery and were less likely to need additional anaesthetic when performed using ultrasound guidance or ultrasound guidance combined with other techniques. We also found that there were fewer complications such as 'pins and needles' or accidental punctures of blood vessels. It also took less time to perform the nerve block when ultrasound alone was used. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was variation in the quality of the studies and authors had not always made sufficient attempts to ensure that the outcome assessors were unaware of what technique had been used for the nerve block. Studies had also often not clearly explained how experienced the people giving the nerve block were. This is particularly important, as ultrasound is still a relatively new technique and some anaesthetists may have limited experience. We rated our evidence for whether the nerve blocks were sufficient and adequate for surgery as of moderate quality, but evidence for our other outcomes was either low or very low. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for peripheral nerve blocks. However, we are unable to say whether this result depends on the experience of the practitioner in the technique being used.
