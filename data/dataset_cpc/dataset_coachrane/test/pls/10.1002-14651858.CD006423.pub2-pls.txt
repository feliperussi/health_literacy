Glucagon‐like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes
Glucagon‐like peptide analogues or agonists are a new kind of drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that are given by injection under the skin. They regulate glucose levels by stimulating glucose‐dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying and promoting satiety.  Various glucagon‐like peptide‐1 agonists are in use or in the licensing process, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, taspoglutide, lixisenatide and LY2189265. 
Seventeen randomised controlled trials of mostly moderate to high quality randomised approximately 6899 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. The longest duration study was 30 weeks. Of the seventeen studies, one compared albiglutide with placebo, two compared exenatide 10 µg twice daily against exenatide 2 mg once weekly, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against insulin glargine, one compared exenatide 2 mg once weekly against pioglitazone and sitagliptin, five compared liraglutide with placebo, two compared liraglutide with sulphonylurea, one each compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide, liraglutide with sitagliptin, liraglutide with rosiglitazone and liraglutide with insulin glargine, two compared taspoglutide with placebo and one each compared lixisenatide with placebo and LY2189265 with placebo. In people already treated with oral anti‐diabetes drugs, addition of glucagon‐like peptide analogues improved blood sugar control in comparison to placebo, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone or sitagliptin, but not always in comparison to insulin (for exenatide) or glimepiride (a sulphonylurea). Glucagon‐like peptide analogous caused more weight loss than any of the comparison treatments. However, more nausea and other gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea or vomiting were seen, though these tended to wear off and were not seen in all participants. There was slightly more hypoglycaemia with glucagon‐like analogous than with placebo, but generally less than with other anti‐diabetic treatments. The incidence of hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. The studies were not long enough to assess long‐term side effects. None of the studies investigated mortality or morbidity.
