Use of progesterone for treating preterm labour
Premature birth is associated with various medical problems for the newborn including death and long‐term health problems. The parents of premature babies can experience emotional turmoil and the economic costs are high for healthcare systems. Various medications have been used to delay the onset of labour and prevent premature deliveries but with limited success. Some of the drugs have side‐effects. Progesterone is a hormone that is known to suppress uterine activity and keep the uterus quiescent until term. Medications that mimic this hormone (progestational agents) were first tried in the late 1950s but interest waned. Recently, new trials studying the use of progestational agents both for prevention as well as treatment of preterm labour have been published. This review of the literature found eight randomised controlled trials involving 563 women, but data from only seven studies from a total of 538 women with threatened or established preterm labour with intact membranes contributed data to this updated review. Four trials compared the use of progestational agents versus placebo in women concurrently treated with another drug to reduce uterine contractions (tocolytic agent). Progesterone was used independently in the other four trials compared with another tocolytic agent or placebo. Limited evidence suggests that the use of a progesterone, as a co‐treatment, may reduce preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks' gestation and increase birthweight. There is insufficient evidence from the seven small studies with contributing data to advocate progestational agents as a tocolytic agent for women presenting with preterm labour.
