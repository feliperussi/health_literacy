Pre‐emptive and preventive opioids for postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery 
To assess the ability of a single dose of opioid given before making the first cut during surgery (pre‐emptive opioids) and preventive opioids that are given before the first cut and continued after surgery for reducing pain due to surgery in adults. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for opioid painkillers (strong painkillers) when given before surgery, compared to the same painkiller given only after the surgeon has cut the skin. 
Background 
Most people experience pain after surgery that requires strong opioid painkillers. These medications are associated with a number of side effects including depressed breathing, a slow heart rate, and low blood pressure, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, itching, and constipation. Reducing the amount of opioid needed can limit these side effects and improve the patient experience. Compared to starting painkillers later, beginning painkillers before making the first cut for surgery may reduce pain sensitivity, and so lessen the postoperative pain experienced. We wanted to find out whether giving opioid painkillers before surgery was more effective than giving the same painkiller after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) in March 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group was treated with opioids before the surgeon cut the skin, whilst the other group was given the same medication after the surgeon cut the skin. We identified 20 trials involving a total of 1343 participants aged over 15 years who were undergoing a variety of surgeries. In all but one trial, participants received general anaesthetic. Nearly all participants were low‐risk patients. Only one of the trials used a pre‐emptive dose of opioid.
