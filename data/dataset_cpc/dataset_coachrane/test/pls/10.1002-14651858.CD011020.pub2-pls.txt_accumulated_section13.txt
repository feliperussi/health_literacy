Using technology to rehabilitate children and adolescents with acquired brain injury
Review question 
We aimed to assess the effects of technology‐based interventions in rehabilitating children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Background 
Acquired brain injury is defined as any injury to the brain that occurs following birth and is the result of illness, medical conditions, or trauma. After acquired brain injury a person can experience difficulties with executive functions and memory. Executive functions are brain processes that involve planning and emotional control, which govern the ability to start and stop our actions. Memory processes allow us to store and recall information about our world. Executive functions also include an aspect of memory called working memory. Technology is increasingly being used to help children and adolescents recover from acquired brain injury. Technological aids used to rehabilitate memory and executive functions include pagers, smartphones, internet‐based interventions, and voice recorders.

Study characteristics 
We identified four studies (including 206 participants) that investigated the effectiveness of technology‐based interventions to rehabilitate children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. All four studies were conducted in North America, with three originating from the same research team. 
One study with 120 participants used an online Counselor‐Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) intervention to rehabilitate executive functioning in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
One study with 35 participants used a Teen Online Problem‐Solving intervention to target the executive functioning of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. 
One study with 40 participants used an online Family Problem Solving intervention to target outcomes such as behaviour and aspects of executive functioning in children aged 5 to 16 years. 
One study with 12 participants used a computer program to target cognitive‐communication skills including memory and aspects of executive functions in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years.
