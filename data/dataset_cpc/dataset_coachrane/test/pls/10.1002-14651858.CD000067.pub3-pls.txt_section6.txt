A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) suggests that azathioprine (at daily doses of 1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease over a 6 to 18 month period. A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) showed no difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6‐mercaptopurine (1.0 mg/day) and aminosalicylate therapy (mesalazine 3 g/day or sulfasalazine 0.5g/15 kg/day). One small study (77 participants) suggests that azathioprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) may be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission over a one year period. One small study (36 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab alone. One small study (31 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between 6‐mercaptopurine (1 mg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week). One study (147 participants) failed to show any difference in time spent in remission between early azathioprine treatment and a conventional management strategy. An increased risk of side effects was seen in participants who received azathioprine. Some of these side effects such as leukopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood) were serious in nature. Common side effects included pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection. The choice to use azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine should be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of using these drugs. More research is needed to allow conclusions about the comparative effectiveness and side effects of azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine compared to other maintenance therapies such as methotrexate. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and side effects of the use of azathioprine with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with inactive Crohn's disease.
