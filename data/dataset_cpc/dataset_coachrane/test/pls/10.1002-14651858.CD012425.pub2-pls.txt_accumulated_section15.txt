Follow‐up strategies after completion of primary cancer treatment
What is the aim of this review? 
In this Cochrane Review, we aimed to find out if cancer survivors who received three different types of follow‐up care, after they were treated for their cancer, have better medical and personal outcomes. We collected and assessed all relevant studies and found 53 studies. 
Key messages 
Non‐specialist‐led follow‐up, such as follow‐up provided by a general practitioner (GP) or nurse, makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life, anxiety or depression, when compared to specialist‐led follow‐up. We cannot be sure about its effects on overall survival and detection of a cancer returning after treatment (recurrence). 
Less intensive follow‐up, such as follow‐up with fewer examinations or tests, may make little or no difference to overall survival but probably delays detection of recurrence when compared to more intensive follow‐up. However, other types of studies are needed before we can be certain about the effects of early detection of recurrence on survival. We also cannot be sure about its effect on health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression. 
There was little evidence for the final type of follow‐up, which integrated additional components relevant for detection of recurrence, such as patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans. 
What was studied in the review? 
After being treated for cancer, most patients receive follow‐up care to look for signs of recurrence. If the cancer returns, it is thought to be better to detect it earlier, as it allows earlier treatment, which is expected to improve survival for the patient. Traditional follow‐up involving fixed visits to a cancer specialist in a hospital setting for examinations and tests can be expensive and burdensome for the patient. Newer follow‐up strategies involving non‐specialist care providers, different intensity of examinations, or the addition of survivorship care plans have been developed and tested but their effectiveness remains unclear. 
The aim of our review was to find out if three types of aftercare increased survival, decreased the time until recurrence is detected, and improved patient outcomes such as health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression, as well as cost. The types of aftercare were: 1) non‐specialist‐led (e.g. GP‐led, nurse‐led, patient‐initiated or shared care) versus specialist‐led follow‐up; 2) less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up (based on frequency or intensity of clinical visits, examinations or diagnostic procedures); and 3) follow‐up integrating additional care components relevant for detection of recurrence (e.g. patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) versus usual care. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We analysed 53 studies, involving 20,832 participants with 12 types of cancer in 15 different countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Australia. All the studies were carried out in either a hospital or general practice setting. 
When cancer survivors receive aftercare led by non‐specialists, such as GPs and nurses:  
‐ We are not sure if overall survival is affected or if cancer recurrence is detected earlier; 
‐ It probably makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life and anxiety and it makes no difference for depression at 12 months of follow‐up;
