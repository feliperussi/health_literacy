What is the most effective treatment for atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome?
What is the issue? 
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a condition involving blockages in small blood vessels leading to destruction of blood cells and dysfunction of several organs, most notably the kidneys. It is commonly caused by infections, often E.Coli, and can be associated with diarrhoea. A rare form of HUS known as atypical HUS (aHUS) is a more aggressive form of the disease caused by inherited or acquired abnormalities of proteins involved in controlling an aspect of our immune system known as “complement”. Almost half of cases involve patients aged less than 18 years. In the past a diagnosis of aHUS was associated with a poor prognosis with patients often progressing to kidney failure and death. More recently, an improved understanding of the condition has led to better treatments. This review aims to evaluate the usefulness of these treatments by systematically examining the available evidence in order to find out the most effective treatments available for aHUS. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature extensively and found five studies which tested therapies for aHUS. In four studies the treatment used was eculizumab and in one study the treatment was ravulizumab. Both of these recently developed drugs act in a similar way and have shown promise in other medical conditions. 
What did we find? 
The included studies demonstrated that the majority of patients treated with either eculizumab or ravulizumab showed improvements in kidney function with a large proportion improving enough to stop dialysis treatment. Markers of disease activity in the blood also improved significantly. Over the course of 26 weeks of treatment, no patients given eculizumab died, although two patients did contract meningococcal infections, a likely consequence of the treatment. Although four patients treated with ravulizumab died, none of these deaths were thought to be caused by the drug. The quality of life of patients treated with both drugs was improved significantly. 
Conclusions 
aHUS is an extremely rare condition and without treatment is often fatal. For this reason, we found no studies which were able to compare one treatment with another, or one treatment with no treatment. Instead, the included studies gave all participants either eculizumab or ravulizumab, with results only comparable with historical data obtained before these drugs were available. This introduces substantial bias into the review, and therefore limits the confidence of any recommendations which stem from it. Nevertheless, the best available evidence suggests that treatment with either eculizumab or ravulizumab is effective in patients with aHUS and appears superior to previous therapies.
