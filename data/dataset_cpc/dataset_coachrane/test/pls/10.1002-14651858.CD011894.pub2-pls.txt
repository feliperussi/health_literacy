Family therapy for autism spectrum disorders
Review question 
What is the evidence that family therapy can help to improve communication, strengthen relationships, and enhance coping, mental health and well‐being for people who have autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) or their family members, or both? 
Background 
People with ASD often experience difficulty with knowing how to communicate with others, and with developing and maintaining friendships and relationships. They can also find it difficult to manage changes to their routine. People with ASD tend to rely on family members, including parents and siblings, well into adulthood. Family members of people with ASD sometimes experience stress, anxiety and depression. 
Several research studies have investigated the benefits of talking therapies for individuals with ASD or for family members. While study findings suggest that these therapies can improve communication and coping, and mental health and well‐being, outcomes are usually reported for the person with ASD or family members, but not both. 
Family therapy is designed to help people within the family make sense of difficult situations, and help them work together to develop new ways of thinking about and managing these difficulties. It is important to find out if family therapy can be helpful for people with ASD and their relatives given that the core symptoms of ASD, and additional difficulties people can experience, often impact on the family unit. 
We searched for all the available evidence, published or unpublished, up until 16 January 2017, which examined family therapy for ASD. 
Study characteristics 
While there have been a few studies investigating the benefits of family therapy interventions for ASD, none have compared family therapy with either no treatment, a group of people waiting to start treatment, or another type of psychological therapy. There is one study awaiting classification. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is limited high‐quality evidence available about whether family therapy is helpful for people with ASD or their family members. More research studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of family‐focused interventions to enhance communication, reduce stress and improve coping.
