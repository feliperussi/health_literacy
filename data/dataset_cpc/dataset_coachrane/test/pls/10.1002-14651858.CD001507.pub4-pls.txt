Adding the amino acid tyrosine to the diet of people with phenylketonuria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence that in people with PKU (who commenced the diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life) tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of low phenylalanine diet, improves: intelligence; neuropsychological performance; growth and nutritional status; mortality rate; and quality of life. This is an update of previously published versions of this review. 
Background 
Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease. People with phenylketonuria can either not process phenylalanine from their diet at all or only in part. High blood levels of phenylalanine can cause brain or nerve damage. A diet avoiding foods high in phenylalanine can be hard to follow. People with phenylketonuria can have low levels of the amino acid tyrosine in their blood.

Study characteristics 
The review included three trials with 56 people with phenylketonuria aged between six and 28 years of age. Trials compared adding tyrosine or placebo (a substance which contains no medication) to a phenylalanine‚Äêrestricted diet and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The length of the treatment and control arms were short in all three trials and some of the outcomes considered important in this review were not measured. 
Key results 
Although the amount of tyrosine measured in the blood of those taking the supplement was higher, there were no differences noted in any other outcome measures. There is no evidence to suggest that tyrosine should be routinely added to the diet of people with phenylketonuria. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to provide more evidence. However, given this is not an active area of research, we have no plans to update this review in the future. 
Quality of the evidence 
The three trials considered in this review were of a good quality, but only included a small number of participants.
