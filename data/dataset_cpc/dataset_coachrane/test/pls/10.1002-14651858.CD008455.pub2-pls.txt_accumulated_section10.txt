Interventions for treating osteonecrosis of the jaw bones associated with bisphosphonate drugs 
Review question 
How well do treatments for bisphosphonate‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw bones, or 'BRONJ', work and how safe are they? 
Background 
Bisphosphonates are drugs very similar to pyrophosphate (a normal substance found in bone). They are used to lessen symptoms and complications due to the spread of cancer to the bones, and to prevent and treat fragile bones in osteoporosis (a conditon where tiny holes in the bones makes them brittle). These drugs can cause a rare but serious condition called bisphosphonate‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw or 'BRONJ'. BRONJ affects the healing of bone damage by interrupting the process of removing dead bone and laying down new bone. When this happens, parts or all of the jaw bone becomes friable (a bit like chalk), and eventually this dead bone can be exposed. This makes it difficult for people to eat, speak or brush their teeth, and it often causes severe pain. 
Many different treatments are currently used for BRONJ. They can be categorised as non‐invasive treatments (such as antibiotics and mouth rinses), surgical approaches or "add‐on" treatments used to enhance usual care (for example, ozone therapy or use of blood plasma that has been enriched with platelets). Different treatments may be combined. 
Study characteristics 
Review authors, working with the Cochrane Oral Health Group, carried out a thorough search up to 15 December 2015 for studies that randomly allocated participants to different treatments for BRONJ (or to a 'placebo' condition that has no active treatment). This type of study design is known as a 'randomised controlled trial'. We only found one relevant completed study and two ongoing studies. The completed study compared people with BRONJ being treated with surgery, antibiotics and mouth rinses to people receiving the same 'standard care' with an add‐on treatment called hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is thought to increase bone renewal. There were 49 participants, most of whom had cancer. 
Key results 
The study found that the participants in intervention group were more likely than the standard care group participants to have an improvement in their osteonecrosis at three months, but there was no clear difference between the groups when they were evaluated at six, 12 and 18 months and last contact. There was no clear difference between the groups at any time point for complete healing. These results are not reliable as the quality of the evidence is very low. The study did not assess whether there were any side effects of the treatment.
