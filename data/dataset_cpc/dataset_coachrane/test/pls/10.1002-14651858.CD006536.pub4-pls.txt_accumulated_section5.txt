Stem cell treatment following a heart attack
Review question: Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment following a heart attack? 
Background: Currently the standard treatment for people suffering a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) is direct opening of the artery with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty and introduction of a small tube (called a stent) into the artery to keep it open. The use of primary angioplasty and stents to reopen the blocked artery can lead to a 35% reduction in the mortality (death rate) associated with this condition. In recent years, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a potential treatment. They may prevent the damage to the heart muscle caused by a heart attack, when used in addition to the treatment offered by primary angioplasty and standard medical therapy. 
Study characteristics: Randomised trials comparing bone marrow‐derived cells with no cells in patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were eligible for this review. We searched databases to March 2015. This review was supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) through its Cochrane Incentive Award programme. 
Key results: In this updated systematic review we analysed data from a total of 41 trials with over 2700 patients. Evaluation of the currently available evidence indicates that this treatment may not lead to improvement when compared to standard treatment, as measured by the frequency of deaths, heart attacks and/or heart failure requiring re‐hospitalisation following treatment, as well as tests of heart function, in the short and long term.
