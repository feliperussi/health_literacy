What are the best ways of treating adults with a fractured (broken) shoulder?
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to tell whether early movement of the arm after one week in a sling makes a difference to long‐term shoulder function or the development of shoulder problems compared with supporting the arm in a sling for three or more weeks. 
‐ Patients report that surgery does not result in better shoulder function for most types of displaced fractures (where the broken parts have moved apart) than non‐surgical treatment. However, it may result in a higher risk of follow‐up surgery for complications. 
‐ If surgery is undertaken, there is not enough evidence to say what is the best method.
What are proximal humeral fractures? 
The proximal humerus is the top end of the upper arm bone. Fracture of the proximal humerus is a common and serious injury in older people. It is often called a broken (fractured) shoulder. It can take several months for people to recover the use of their arm. Some restrictions in movement and pain are common long‐term problems. 
What are the usual ways of treating these fractures? 
Treatments include:
‐ non‐surgical treatment: the injured arm is supported in a sling for one or more weeks; 
‐ surgery: used for ‘displaced’ fractures, where the broken parts have moved apart. Surgery may involve bringing the parts back in place and fixing these with screws in a metal plate or with a nail placed in the bone marrow. Alternatively, in old people, half or all of the ball and socket shoulder joint might be replaced with a metal implant. In hemiarthroplasty, just the ball (humeral head) of the shoulder joint is replaced. The use of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is increasing. As well as replacing the whole joint, the positions of the ball and the socket joint are reversed in RTSA. After surgery, the injured arm is initially supported in a sling. 
All treatments are followed by rehabilitation.
