Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infancy for the prevention of allergy
Review question 
In infants, does supplementation of the diet with oil high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) result in a decreased risk of developing allergies such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever (called allergic rhinitis) and food allergy in infancy and childhood? 
Background 
Allergy is responsible for a substantial health burden in infants, children and adults. Early dietary intakes may influence the development of allergic disease. Dietary PUFAs, such as fish oil, have a role in inflammatory conditions. It is important to determine if dietary PUFAs given as supplements or added to infant formula have the potential to prevent the development of allergy. PUFAs may be given to the breastfeeding mother, to the infant as a supplement (contents of a capsule) or added to infant formula. 
Study characteristics 
This review found 100 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs in infants through searches of medical databases up to September 2015. However, only nine of these studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes (measures). Of these nine studies, we considered only one to be high quality. Five studies reported all allergy as an outcome measure; four studies reported asthma; all nine studies reported dermatitis/eczema; two studies reported allergic rhinitis and four studies reported food allergy. 
Key results 
PUFA supplementation in infancy did not affect the risk of infant (aged up to two years of age) or childhood (aged up to 10 years of age) allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema and food allergy. There was a reduction in the risk of allergic rhinitis during infancy, however, there was no effect on the risk of childhood allergic rhinitis. There is insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis. 
Quality of evidence 
We graded the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all allergy as very low; the reduction in infant incidence of allergic rhinitis as very low; and the evidence for no effect on infant incidence, childhood incidence and childhood prevalence of all other allergic outcomes as very low to low. Further high quality studies are needed before we can determine an effect of higher PUFA intake in infants on the risk of allergic disease.
