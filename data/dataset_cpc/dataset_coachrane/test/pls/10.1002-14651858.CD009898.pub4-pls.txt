Extracorporeal photopheresis treatment for chronic graft‐versus‐host disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children and adolescents 
Background 
Chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGvHD) is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplant of blood‐forming stem cells). Immune cells (white blood cells) from the donor recognise the recipient's cells as foreign ('non‐self'). Therefore, the transplanted immune cells attack the cells of the recipient. The main affected organs are skin, liver and gut, among others. These immune reactions may cause acute inflammation (sudden swelling) followed by chronic (long‐term) changes to organs (e.g. fibrosis; scarring of the lungs). First‐line therapy usually consists of immunosuppressive drugs (which reduce the strength of the body's immune system) in the form of corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in refractory cases (where the disease is resistant to treatment). These drugs are supposed to suppress the immune‐mediated attack of the patient's cells. Limited effectiveness and severe side effects of these drugs have led to several alternative approaches. 
Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy (a treatment that makes changes to immune function) that involves collection of immune cells from peripheral blood outside the patient's body. These immune cells are exposed to a photoactive agent (a chemical that responds to exposure to light; e.g. 8‐methoxypsoralen) with subsequent ultraviolet‐A radiation and then re‐infused. We are not sure how this affects immune function. Several current clinical practice recommendations suggest consideration of ECP in children and adolescents with cGvHD. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of chronic graft‐versus‐host disease in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) after HSCT. 
Results 
We did not find any RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for children and adolescents with cGvHD after HSCT. Current recommendations are only based on retrospective studies (where outcomes occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational studies (where investigators did not intervene, and simply observed the course of events). Ideally, ECP should only be given to children and adolescents in the context of RCTs. ECP may be considered in people with steroid‐refractory cGvHD, keeping in mind that such a treatment is not supported by high‐level evidence. If children and adolescents are given ECP, doctors should collect information about beneficial and harmful effects and set up registries for people treated with ECP.
