Laparoscopic surgical box model training for surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience 
Background 
Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform the surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is costly, time consuming, and is of variable effectiveness. Laparoscopic surgery involves use of instruments using key‚Äêhole incisions and is generally considered more difficult than open surgery. Training using box models (physical simulation) is an option to supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training. The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. We sought to answer the question of whether the box model training is useful in such trainees in terms of improving technical outcomes by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised clinical trials. Randomised clinical trials are commonly called randomised controlled trials and are the best study design to answer such questions. If conducted well, they provide the most accurate answers to questions about intervention effects. Two authors searched the medical literature available to May 2013 and obtained the information from the identified trials. The use of two authors decreases the errors in obtaining the information. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included seven trials in which 249 surgical trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience received either box model training in addition to their standard apprenticeship training (122 trainees) versus standard apprenticeship training alone (127 trainees). The choice of whether the trainees received supplementary box model training was made in a random method similar to the toss of a coin. Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada. After supplementary box model training or standard training, the performance of the trainees was evaluated on their first operation after supplementary box model training and during the first operation in humans after an equivalent time after standard training. Different trials assessed the performance in different operations and all these operations were minor to moderate operations.
