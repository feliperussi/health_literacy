Automated telephone communication systems for preventing disease and managing long‐term conditions 
Background 
Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) send voice messages and collect health information from people using their telephone's touch‐tone keypad or voice recognition software. This could replace or supplement telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are several types of ATCS: one‐way voice messages to patients (unidirectional), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, those with added functions like referral to advice (ATCS Plus), or those where ATCS are part of a complex intervention (multimodal). 
Review question 
This review assessed the effectiveness of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long‐term conditions. 
Results 
We found 132 trials with over 4 million participants across preventive healthcare areas and for the management of long‐term conditions. 
Studies compared ATCS types in many ways.
Some studies reported findings across diseases. For prevention, ATCS probably increase immunisation uptake in children, and slightly in adolescents, but in adults effects are uncertain. Also for prevention, multimodal ATCS increase numbers of people screened for breast or colorectal cancers, and may increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus probably slightly increases attendance for cervical cancer screening, with uncertain effects on osteoporosis screening. IVR probably increases the numbers screened for colorectal cancer up to six months, with little effect on breast cancer screening. 
ATCS (unidirectional or IVR) may improve appointment attendance, key to both preventing and managing disease. 
For long‐term management, multimodal ATCS had inconsistent effects on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably improves medication adherence versus usual care. Compared with control, ATCS Plus and IVR probably slightly improve adherence, while unidirectional ATCS may have little, or slightly positive, effects. No intervention consistently improved clinical outcomes. IVR probably improves test adherence, but ATCS Plus may have little effect.
