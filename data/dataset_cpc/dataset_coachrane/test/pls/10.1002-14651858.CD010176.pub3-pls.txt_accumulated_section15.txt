What works best to preserve the jaw bone after tooth extraction?
Why is this question important? 
Tooth extraction is a common procedure that can be used for example to:
‐ remove damaged or diseased teeth;‐ remove teeth that are in the wrong place; or‐ make room for other teeth. 
After a tooth extraction, the part of the jaw bone that used to hold the tooth shrinks because it is no longer needed to support the tooth. If the bone shrinks too much, this can: 
‐ make it difficult or impossible to replace the missing tooth with an artificial one (an implant); and‐ weaken the support and health of neighbouring teeth. 
To limit bone loss after tooth extraction, dentists or surgeons can carry out a procedure called alveolar ridge preservation (ARP). ARP involves filling the hole left by the missing tooth (using a range of different materials and techniques), and leaving it to heal for several months. The hole can be filled with human, animal, or artificial bone. It can be covered over (to stop gums from growing into the hole) using: 
‐ materials that, after some time, are naturally absorbed by the body; or‐ materials that need to be removed with surgery once no longer needed. 
To find out if ARP works to preserve jaw bone after tooth extraction, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We also wanted to know if any materials and ARP techniques are better than others. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ ARP against no ARP; or‐ different ARP materials or techniques. 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 16 studies that followed a total of 426 adults for at least six months. The studies took place in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Four studies were supported by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The other studies either received public funding, no specific funding, or did not report funding source.
