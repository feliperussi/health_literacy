Prophylactic (preventive) chemotherapy for hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) to prevent cancerous growth later 
Background A molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole) develops following an abnormal process of conception, whereby placental tissue overgrows inside the womb (uterus). Molar pregnancies are classified as complete (CM) or partial (PM) based on their appearance (gross and microscopic), and their chromosome pattern. When present, moles are usually suspected at the early pregnancy scan and women often present with bleeding, similar to a miscarriage. The molar tissue is removed by evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC), also known as dilatation and curettage (D&C) and women generally make a full recovery. However, some women go on to develop a cancer in the womb (about 1 in every 5 women with a CM and 1 in 200 with a PM). Women are generally at a higher risk of getting this cancer, which is known as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), if they are over 40 years old, have a large increase in the size of the womb, have large cysts in the ovaries or have high initial levels of β‐human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (the pregnancy hormone) in their blood. Although treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy (anti‐cancer drugs) is almost always effective, it has been suggested that routinely giving women anti‐cancer drugs (P‐Chem) before or after the removal the molar tissue may reduce the risk of the cancerous tissue developing. 
The aim of the review By doing this review, we tried to assess the benefits and risks of giving anti‐cancer drugs (P‐Chem) to women with molar pregnancies, before or after ERPC.
