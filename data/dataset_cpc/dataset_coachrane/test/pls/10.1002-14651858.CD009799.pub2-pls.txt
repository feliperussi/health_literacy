Two different surgical procedures for people who are near‐sighted
Research question  How does laser‐assisted subepithelial keratectomy compare with photorefractive keratectomy for eyes with myopia? 
Background  Myopia (short‐sightedness or near‐sightedness) is a condition whereby people cannot see distant objects clearly. The prevalence of myopia is increasing worldwide, especially in some Asian areas. Spectacles and contact lenses are commonly used for correction of this condition. Surgical procedures such as laser‐assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) also can be used for correction of myopia. In both procedures, a laser is used to remove corneal tissue (front of the eye); these procedures have been performed in human eyes for nearly 30 years. 
Study characteristics  We identified 11 trials that enrolled 428 adult participants. These trials were conducted in various countries, including the Czech Republic, Brazil, Italy, Iran, China, Korea, Mexico, Turkey, USA, and UK. Ten out of 11 trials used a paired‐eye design, in which one eye of each participant received LASEK and the other eye received PRK. The remaining trial included one eye of six participants and both eyes of 15 participants. Most participants included in the trials had low to moderate myopia. The evidence is current as of 15 December 2015. 
Key results  Because these trials reported different outcomes at different time points, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of LASEK versus PRK across trials. We assessed our primary outcomes 12 months after the surgeries were performed. Available data were insufficient to clarify whether LASEK performed better than PRK with respect to correcting visual acuity to 20/20 or better, achieving within 0.50 diopters of target refraction, or preventing loss of corrected visual acuity. Data were insufficient for assessment of whether differences between procedures in adverse outcomes occurred at 12 months after the surgeries. At 24 months post treatment, one trial reported that eyes treated LASEK with may have better corneal haze scores than those treated with PRK, but that the difference may not be noticeable. 
Quality of the evidence  Available data were insufficient for investigation of whether LASEK or PRK is better at correcting near‐sightedness. We judged the evidence for most outcomes as very low to moderate quality because of variation in reporting and differences in effects among trials.
