Prebiotics for the prevention of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
Review question: Do prebiotics prevent hyperbilirubinaemia, an elevated level of bilirubin that leads to jaundice, in newborn infants? 
Background: Jaundice occurs in approximately two‐thirds of all newborns during the first days of life. Phototherapy is commonly used for management of neonatal jaundice. Phototherapy does not seem to cause serious side effects, but recently some clinical trials have raised concerns based on animal or cell culture studies regarding its potential to damage DNA. Therefore, other types of treatment for neonatal jaundice are being considered. Some evidence suggests that enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics reduces jaundice among neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included three small studies (with a total of 154 infants) that compared the effects of feeding supplementation with prebiotics on neonatal jaundice to a placebo (such as distilled water). The evidence is up to date as of 14 June 2018. 
Key results: There is inadequate evidence to assess the effectiveness of prebiotics on neonatal jaundice. According to the available data, the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (low‐quality evidence) and treatment with phototherapy (low‐quality evidence) were decreased by feeding supplementation with prebiotics, but only one small study reported on these outcomes. 
The meta‐analyses of these small studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (low‐quality evidence) and a significant increase in stool frequency (high‐quality evidence) in infants with prebiotic supplementation versus placebo. Furthermore, meta‐analyses showed no significant difference in maximum plasma bilirubin levels (low‐quality evidence), duration of phototherapy (low‐quality evidence) and neonatal mortality (low‐quality evidence) between groups. The review found only three randomised clinical trials that compared prebiotic supplementation with a placebo. More research is needed.
