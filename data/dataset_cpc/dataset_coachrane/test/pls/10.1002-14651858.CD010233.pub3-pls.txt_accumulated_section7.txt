Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine for the maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in Crohn’s disease 
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues (azathioprine (AZA) and 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP)) used for maintaining remission following surgery in people with Crohn's disease (CD). 
What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. The disease is known to constantly change from periods when sufferers have symptoms (relapse) to periods when the symptoms disappear (remission) for a short time. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut. However, their symptoms can return after a short time. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease are free from symptoms for as long as possible. However, there are concerns about possible side effects that may arise. Purine analogues (AZA and 6‐MP) are a group of immunosuppressive drugs which have been used for over five decades to manage Crohn's disease. We researched whether purine antimetabolites can maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease after the diseased portion of their gut has been removed. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review authors found 10 relevant studies with a total of 928 participants, conducted across several European countries, Israel and the US. The studies included people with Crohn's disease over 16 years of age who had undergone surgery and were free from symptoms. These studies compared purine analogues with placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), or oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) formulations or with anti‐tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (anti‐TNF‐α) drugs. 5‐ASA and anti‐TNF‐ɑ drugs are used reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut.
