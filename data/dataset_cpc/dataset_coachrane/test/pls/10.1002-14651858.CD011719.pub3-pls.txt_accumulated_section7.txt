Effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (with or without valve surgery) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC, the temporary blockage of arterial blood flow to one arm or one leg before surgery after induction of anaesthesia) in people undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without additional valve surgery. 
Background 
Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from progressive blockage of the coronary arteries. If coronary arteries are partly or fully blocked, they cannot supply the heart with enough oxygen. Symptoms of CAD include shortness of breath, pain in the upper body (e.g. arms, left shoulder, back, etc). CAD can be treated with medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Despite substantial improvements in surgical strategies, cardiac surgery is associated with severe complications. Several approaches have been implemented to reduce the risk during surgery (hypothermia, cardioplegic solutions, and the limitation of procedure times). These strategies have led to a pronounced reduction in mortality and morbidity, however, biomarkers of ischaemia indicate persisting postoperative myocardial damage. RIPC has been reported to reduce these biomarkers of ischaemia in people who undergo cardiac surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to assess whether this practice improves clinical outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomised trials in which people scheduled for CABG (with or without valve surgery) were randomly assigned to receive RIPC or sham intervention before surgery. The evidence is current to May 2016. We did not identify any source of bias related to the funding of included studies.
