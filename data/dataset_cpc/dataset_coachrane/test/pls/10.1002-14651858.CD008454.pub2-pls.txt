The effect of anti‐inflammatory drugs in protecting the nerve cells involved in Parkinson's Disease 
Different agents have been examined for their effects in protecting the nerve cells that die in Parkinson's disease (PD). These are often called neuroprotective or disease‐modifying agents. They can act by preventing the onset of the disease itself (called primary prevention) or by halting the progression of PD once it has been established (called secondary prevention). Inflammation in the nervous system is thought to be one of the possible mechanisms of nerve cell death in PD, which has led investigators to look at the potential of anti‐inflammatory drugs in PD. The current review aimed to look at the effects of anti‐inflammatory drugs on both preventing the onset of PD and also on symptoms and the progression of disease in people who already have PD. 
Epidemiological or observational studies were used to see if taking an anti‐inflammatory drug reduces the risk of developing PD in the general population. We found fourteen studies. Investigators looked at both aspirin and non‐aspirin anti‐inflammatory drugs and also the individual drug ibuprofen. We pooled results from the included studies. Overall, there was no benefit seen with taking aspirin, but a slight reduction in the risk of developing PD in people taking non‐aspirin anti‐inflammatory drugs. Ibuprofen was examined in isolation in four of the included studies. Larger benefits were seen when taking this drug. 
Clinical trials were used to see if taking an anti‐inflammatory drug when you already have PD reduces symptoms or slows disease progression. We found no trials from the extensive searching. As no clinical trials were found, there is also a lack of information about any adverse effects of taking anti‐inflammatory drugs in people with PD. 
Non‐aspirin anti‐inflammatory drugs appear to reduce the risk of developing PD, particularly ibuprofen. However, more research is needed to determine which individual drugs work best, what dose to take and over what period, in whom (those at high risk for PD or the general population) before any recommendations can be made about their use in preventing PD onset. These studies will also help to identify possible drugs to be examined further in early trials of safety in those who already have PD, to see if they could potentially halt disease progression or improve symptoms.
