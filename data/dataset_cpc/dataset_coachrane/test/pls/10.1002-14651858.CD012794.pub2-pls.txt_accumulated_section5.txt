Stem cell therapy for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
Background 
Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a condition characterized by recurring progressive inflammation and clotting in small‐ and medium‐sized arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Its cause is unknown, but it is most common in men with a history of tobacco use. It is responsible for ulcers and extreme pain in the limbs of young smokers. In many cases, mainly in patients with the most severe form, there is no possibility of improving the condition with surgery, and therefore, alternative treatments are used. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment performed through the implantation of cells (from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood etc.) which are capable of becoming new blood vessels, improving local circulation and contributing to the healing of ulcers and relieving rest pain. This review assessed the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Key results 
Only one randomized controlled study (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cells derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care was included in this review (most recent search was 17 October 2017). We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy from different sources, stem cell therapy versus drug treatment and stem cell therapy versus sympathectomy (surgical cutting of a sympathetic nerve). The results showed a decrease in ulcer size and improvement in pain‐free walking distance in the group receiving the stem cell implantation compared with the group receiving placebo and standard wound dressing care.
