What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? 
Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery.
