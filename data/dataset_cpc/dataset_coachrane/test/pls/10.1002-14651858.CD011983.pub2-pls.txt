Supervised‐dosing strategies versus take‐home opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of supervised dosing strategies in opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs. 
Background 
Opioid dependence (OD) is a global clinical and public health problem that is associated with significant burden of disease and drug‐related deaths. OD represents a complex health condition that usually requires long‐term treatment. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as a first‐line treatment for OD. OST is a form of health care for people who are dependent on heroin, or who have become dependent after taking prescribed opioids for pain, and involves substitution of the drug that is being used inappropriately with a long‐acting opioid. OST gives people who are opioid dependent the opportunity to stabilise their lives, and to address the social and psychological dimensions that tend to accompany opioid dependence. A negative aspect of OST is that the medications used can be diverted, by being sold on the black market or used inappropriately. One strategy for minimising diversion is for OST medications to be administered under supervision (supervised dosing). With supervised dosing, access to unsupervised or take‐away doses of medication is then a privilege which can be used as a motivational and reward incentive. Supervised dosing is also associated with more frequent contact between the client and service provider offering more opportunities for therapeutic engagement. However, providing supervised dosing is more expensive for service providers, and more restrictive for clients who have to attend for dosing every day. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of supervised dosing, compared to dispensing of take‐home medication, in terms of reduction in heroin and other unsanctioned opioid use, retention in treatment, diversion of medication and adverse effects.

Study characteristics 
We identified six studies involving 7999 people receiving treatment with methadone (7786 people) or buprenorphine–naloxone (213 people ) for opioid dependence. Four of the studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), while the other two studies followed groups of people over time. Four of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health Research and by the Health Research Board, with one study not reporting the funding source. One study was also funded by the drug company of buprenorphine–naloxone. 
Key results 
At three or more months follow‐up, this review found no evidence on benefit of the supervised dosing with respect to keep people in treatment, or reduce opioid use, mortality reduction and adverse drug events. One study found that supervised dosing led to a reduction of diversion. None of the studies assessed the effect of supervised dosing on pain symptoms, drug craving, days of unsanctioned opioid use, overdose and hospitalisation. 
We are unable to make any conclusion about the effectiveness of supervised dosing compared to dispensing of medication as take‐home doses, in the context of OST. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supervised or take‐home dosing in OST. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the studies were moderately well‐conducted, but there was a small number of studies reporting outcomes of interest, therefore insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of intervention such as diversion, opoid use reduction, retention in treatment and frequency of unsanctioned opioid use, Furthermore, low rates of occurrence of some events between studies resulted in the overall quality of the evidence being assessed as low and very low. This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review.
