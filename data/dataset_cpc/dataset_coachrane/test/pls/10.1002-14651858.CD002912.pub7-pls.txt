Open retropubic colposuspension for urinary incontinence in women
Importance of the Review / Background  
Stress urinary incontinence is losing urine when coughing, laughing, sneezing or exercising. It can be caused by changes to muscles and ligaments holding up the bladder. Mixed urinary incontinence is also losing urine when there is an urge to void as well as when coughing and laughing. Muscle‐strengthening exercises can help, and there are surgical procedures to improve support or correct problems. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence. Open retropubic colposuspension is an operation which involves lifting the tissues around the junction between the bladder and the urethra. 
Main Findings  
The review of trials found that this is an effective surgical technique for stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women, resulting in long‐term cure for most women. It provides better cure rates compared to anterior colporrhaphy a (suturing of the top wall of the vagina) and needle suspension surgery (passing a needle with sutures at the sides of the urethra to lift up the tissues beside it).New techniques, particularly sling operations (including the use of tapes to lift up the urethra)and keyhole (laparoscopic) colposuspension, look promising but need further research particularly on long‐term performance. Procedures involving surgery to insert a tape under the urethra showed better cure rates in the medium and long term, compared to open colposuspension. In terms of costs, a non‐systematic review of economic studies suggested that open retropubic colposuspension would be cheaper than laparoscopic colposuspension, but more expensive than tension‐free vaginal tape (TVT). 
Adverse Events  
Laparoscopic colposuspension allows for faster recovery compared to open colposuspension. Studies did not reveal a higher complication rate with open colposuspension compared with the other surgical techniques, although pelvic organ prolapse was found to be more common. Abnormal voiding was less common after open colposuspension compared to sling surgery. 
Limitations  
Limited information was available on the long term adverse events of open colposuspension and its effect on the quality of life.
