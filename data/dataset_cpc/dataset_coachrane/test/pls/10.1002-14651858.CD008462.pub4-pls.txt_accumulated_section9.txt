Does heparin locking prevent blocking of central venous catheters in adults when compared to locking with normal saline? 
Key message 
We did not find clear evidence of a difference between heparin and normal saline solution (sterile solution of salt in water) in preventing central venous catheter blockages (occlusions), or in the length of time catheters remained unblocked, or in the number of side effects such as infections, death, bleeding, etc. Further well‐designed, large‐scale studies are required to reduce uncertainties. 
Why is this question important? 
Central venous catheters are tubes (also called 'lines') that must be temporarily placed into the veins of patients whose veins need to be accessed regularly for medical reasons. These are inserted into the great vessels leading to the heart. While not in use, a fluid is injected into the catheter until it is next used to avoid blood clots that can block the catheter. This is called locking catheters. Replacement of catheters adds to the cost of care, may delay treatment, and poses an additional risk of catheter‐related adverse events to the patient. The catheter may also become infected, resulting in bloodstream infections. Fluids used for locking are heparin or normal saline. Heparin, which is an anticoagulant, is used to prevent clotting of the blood. It may also help to prevent the catheters from blocking; however, it can also cause bleeding, allergic reactions, and a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. This has raised the question whether heparin is better than saline to avoid blockages, and how safe each method is. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed whether locking catheters with heparin was more effective in reducing the risk of blocking and infections compared to normal saline. In randomised controlled trials, the treatments people receive are decided at random and these give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. 
What we did find? 
We found one new study for this update. In total, we included 12 studies with 2422 people. Five studies included ICU patients, two studies included cancer patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). We cannot conclude that locking catheters with heparin prevents blocking better than flushing with normal saline. We saw little or no difference in the length of time the catheter remained unblocked or in the numbers of side effects between heparin or saline use.
