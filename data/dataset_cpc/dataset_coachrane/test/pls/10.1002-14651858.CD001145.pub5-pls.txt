Late (from the age of seven days) systemic postnatal corticosteroids for preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants 
Review question: to determine the benefits and harms associated with treatment consisting of drugs that suppress inflammation, called corticosteroids, given starting seven days of age or later to prevent or treat lung injury, known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sometimes also called chronic lung disease), in babies born too early (preterm). 
Background: corticosteroids can reduce lung inflammation in newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia but may cause harm. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major problem for newborn babies in neonatal intensive care units, and is associated with both a higher death rate and worse longer‐term outcomes among survivors. Persistent inflammation of the lungs is the most likely cause of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Corticosteroid drugs have strong anti‐inflammatory effects and so have been used to prevent or to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia, particularly in babies who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation. 
Study characteristics: we reviewed all clinical trials in preterm babies that gave corticosteroids systemically, that is, either as an injection or as a medicine, starting from the first seven days of age, and provided data on rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia later in the newborn period. We included 23 studies (1817 infants). Search is up‐to‐date as of 25 September 2020. 
Key results: this review indicates that giving systemic corticosteroids to babies starting at seven days or later after birth reduce the risks of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, without increasing rates of cerebral palsy (a disorder affecting movement ability) in later childhood. However, the longer‐term outcomes have not been well studied. It seems wise to limit late use of systemic corticosteroids to babies who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation, and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment. 
Results for two ongoing studies are awaited.
Certainty of evidence: overall the certainty of evidence supporting our conclusions for major outcomes is high.
