Endometrial injury in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
Review question 
To assess whether it is safe and effective to perform endometrial injury (also known as endometrial scratching), in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and frozen embryo transfer. 
Background 
Couples who have trouble getting pregnant may seek fertility treatments to help them conceive, such as IVF. In an IVF cycle, eggs are collected from the woman and are combined with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. Embryos are transferred into the womb in the hope that they will implant and establish a pregnancy. Implantation is the process by which an embryo embeds itself into the lining of the womb; it is the first step toward establishing a successful pregnancy. It has been suggested that the chances of implantation are increased if endometrial injury is performed before replacement of the embryo into the womb. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 clinical trials (8915 women) which had tested the effects of endometrial injury on the outcomes of IVF. The studies were conducted in different populations of women, and the way the endometrial injury was conducted also differed between studies in terms of the instrument used and the timing of the procedure in relation to the IVF cycle. Many of the studies were poor quality and at high risk of bias, and therefore we performed the main analyses only including studies that were not at high risk of bias. Of the 38 included studies, only eight were included in the primary analyses.
