Drugs that target blood vessels in malignant brain tumours
Background The commonest primary brain tumours of adults are gliomas which comprise about two‐fifths of all primary brain tumours. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade, and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four, according to a classification by the World Health Organization (WHO) that was last updated in 2016. High‐grade glioma, including glioblastoma, are difficult to treat and carry a poor prognosis. 
These tumours produce a protein that promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to help them grow. Drugs have been developed to reduce the formation of new blood vessels and slow tumour growth. Bevacizumab, cediranib and cilengitide are anti‐angiogenic drugs that directly or indirectly target blood vessel formation and have been studied in glioblastoma in randomised clinical trials.  
Study characteristics After a comprehensive search up to October 2018, we identified 11 eligible randomised clinical trials (totaling 3743 participants). All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas; there were no eligible studies that included other brain tumour types. The largest trials were conducted in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma, treated with anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the trials included in this systematic review did not show improvement in overall survival with the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the clinical trials in bevacizumab‐treated glioblastoma did prolong the time until tumour growth (progression‐free survival).  Key results Anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly prolong life in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. In recurrent glioblastoma although there is no evidence of prolonging life over chemotherapy, when anti‐angiogenic therapies are used in combination with certain chemotherapy regimes there may be a small improvement in survival. Anti‐angiogenic agents delay tumour progression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans but is commonly associated with side effects, such as high blood pressure and protein in the urine.
