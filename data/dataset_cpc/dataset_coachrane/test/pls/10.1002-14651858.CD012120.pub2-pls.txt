Physical exercise training for people with spinal muscular atrophy type 3
Review question 
In people with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3, does physical exercise training improve motor function, cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, fatigue, physical activity levels, or quality of life, and does it have unwanted effects? 
Background 
Physical exercise training could improve the physical fitness of people with SMA type 3 and protect them from muscle wasting due to inactivity and disease progression. However, we do not know whether physical exercise training is safe or what specific parts of an exercise program might be helpful. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3. 
Search date 
The evidence is up to date to May 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included one trial that studied the effects of a six‐month, home‐based training program that combined exercises to increase muscle strength with aerobic exercise training (exercise that increases breathing and heart rate). The aerobic exercise training used in the trial was recumbent cycling training (seated cycling, with back support). The study included 14 people with SMA type 3, all of whom were able to walk. The participants were between 10 years and 48 years old and had SMA type 3 of mild‐to‐moderate severity. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to hide the treatment group from participants or personnel, which is an important limitation when measurements rely on participant assessments or effort. 
Study funding sources 
The included study was supported by the United States Department of Defense and the SMA Foundation. 
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but only half of them completed the full aerobic exercise program. 
The effects of physical exercise training in people with SMA type 3 remain unclear, as the evidence is very uncertain.
