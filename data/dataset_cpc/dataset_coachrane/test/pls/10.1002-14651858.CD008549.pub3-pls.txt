Customised versus population‐based growth charts as a screening tool for detecting small for gestational age infants in low‐risk pregnant women 
Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are defined as having a birthweight that is less than that for 10% of the population when plotted on a growth chart based on their gestational age and sex. This definition includes both infants who are normally grown but small, and infants who do not reach their full growth potential (are growth restricted). SGA infants are at an increased risk of complications, fetal distress and even death during labour. Detecting SGA infants is a major challenge for all maternity care providers, particularly with women who have an otherwise healthy pregnancy. 
Several clinical methods are commonly used for assessing an infant’s growth during pregnancy including estimating the size of the uterus by examining the pregnant woman (symphysiofundal height (SFH) and single or a series of ultrasound scans). 
Both of the above measurements can be plotted and followed on growth charts. Most maternity services use standard population‐based growth charts in assessing fetal weight during pregnancy, and monitoring changes from the birthweight after the baby is born. Previous research suggests that customised growth charts which adjust for factors such as the mother's weight and height, ethnicity and number of babies she has had may make assessment of fetal growth more precise, reducing unnecessary consultations for investigations and parental anxiety. 
Currently there are no studies available. Research is needed to assess the effect of using the charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements on the health of women and their babies and should include important outcomes such as mortality.
