Prostaglandin E1 for keeping the duct open in heart conditions in the newborn
Review question: 
Is keeping the ductus arteriosus open with prostaglandin E1 effective and safe in babies with heart conditions that need an open ductus arteriosus for survival? 
Background 
Ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connection between the large blood vessel supplying blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery) and to the large blood vessel supplying blood to the body (aorta). Normally the ductus is open before birth and closes within the first day after birth. However, certain heart conditions where there is a block to the blood flow to the lungs or the body, or a condition where the blood vessels supplying the lungs and body are switched (transposition of great arteries), an open ductus is necessary for survival. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a substance produced by the ductus that keeps it open. External PGE1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in neonates who have heart lesions that depend on an open ductus for survival. PGE1, though lifesaving, is not without risks. There are no systematic reviews to assess PGE1's effectiveness or safety. 
Study characteristics: 
We searched the literature for studies that used chance selection (randomization) that used PGE1 in neonates born at greater than 34 weeks of gestation to keep the ductus arteriosus open in newborn heart conditions and which reported on effectiveness and safety. 
Key results: 
We found no ongoing or completed randomized studies to include in this review. Currently there is no evidence from randomized trials on prostaglandin (PGE1) but information from non‚Äêrandomized studies is available. Use of PGE1 in heart lesions, where the ductus arteriosus needs to stay open, is considered standard of care, and it would be perceived as unethical to do randomized studies. 
Quality of evidence: 
The quality of evidence could not be assessed as we found no randomized studies for inclusion in this review.
