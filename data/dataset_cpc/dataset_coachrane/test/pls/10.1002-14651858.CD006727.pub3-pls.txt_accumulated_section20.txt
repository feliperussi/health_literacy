Long‐term treatment for depression in older people
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012.
Why is this review important? 
Depression is a common problem among older people and causes considerable disability. Even after successful treatment, it frequently recurs. 
The causes of depression in older people are more diverse than in younger adults and, as the number of older people is steadily increasing, it is important to study the effects of treatments specifically in older adults. Treatments commonly used are antidepressant drugs and psychological treatments (talking treatments). 
Who will be interested in this review? 
‐ People with depression, friends, families, and carers.
‐ General practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists. 
‐ Professionals working in older‐adult mental health services.
‐ Professionals working in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in the UK. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
In people aged 60 years and over who have recovered from depression while taking antidepressant medication: 
‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more effective in preventing recurrence of depression than receiving placebo (a pretend treatment) or any of the other treatments? 
‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more harmful than receiving placebo or any of the other treatments? 
Which studies does the review include? 
We searched medical databases to find all relevant studies completed up to 13 July 2015. The studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two, with placebo or the other treatments for preventing recurrence of depression in people aged 60 years and over. We included seven studies, involving 803 people. 
Six studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo. Only two of the studies involved psychological treatments. The studies varied in how they were conducted, numbers of participants, and types of participants. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Remaining on antidepressant medicines for one year appears to reduce the risk of depression returning from 61% to 42% but the benefits at other time intervals could not be determined. Antidepressant treatment appeared to be no more harmful than placebo as measured by number of participants dropping out of trials. The benefits of psychological therapies were not clear, due to the small number of studies. The quality of evidence was low. 
The majority of participants in the studies were women. Few were over 75 years of age. Most had received treatment for their original depressive illness as outpatients, indicating less severe depression.
