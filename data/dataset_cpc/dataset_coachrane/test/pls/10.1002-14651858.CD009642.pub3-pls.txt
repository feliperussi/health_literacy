Intravenous infusion of lidocaine starting at the time of surgery for reduction of pain and improvement of recovery after surgery 
Background 
The most common problems immediately following surgery under general anaesthesia are pain, nausea and vomiting, delirium and slow or no movement of food through the digestive system. Opioid medications given to reduce postoperative pain may also be associated with nausea and constipation, also preventing a smooth recovery. It is of interest for patients and clinicians to reduce or prevent these complications leading to an early recovery so that patients can leave hospital earlier. One option for pain relief after surgery is epidural analgesia, where an opioid or local anaesthetic such as lidocaine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord. Not all patients may be suited to epidural analgesia, and so additional options such as intravenous non‚Äêopioid analgesic medications that enable a rapid recovery are required. 
The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of intravenous infusion of lidocaine in patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Lidocaine is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. 
Study characteristics 
This review was published in 2015, and updated in 2017. We found 68 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), with results from a total of 4525 participants. RCTs are used because they provide the most reliable evidence. 
Intravenous lidocaine was compared with placebo or standard care in 66 of the studies, and with thoracic (chest area of spine) epidural analgesia in two studies. (A placebo is an inactive substance or procedure given to a participant in a medical trial to compare its effects with those of a real drug or other intervention). Lidocaine infusion was started during the surgery, before the first cut, and continued to at least the end of surgery. The included studies were moderately well conducted. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether lidocaine infusion reduces pain, one to four hours after surgery when compared to placebo or usual care (29 studies, over 1600 participants). There was probably no difference in pain at 24 hours (33 studies, 1847 participants) and at 48 hours (24 studies, 1404 participants) between participants in the lidocaine and the placebo group. We are uncertain whether lidocaine infusion improves recovery of bowel function, with a reduction in the time to first defaecation or bowel movements (12 studies, 684 participants), and reduced risk of stopping the passage of food in the gut (4 studies, 273 participants). We are also uncertain whether lidocaine reduces postoperative nausea (35 studies, 1903 participants), and the requirement for opioids for pain relief (40 studies, 2201 participants). Only a limited number of studies systematically analysed adverse effects of intravenous lidocaine infusion. The side effects of intravenous lidocaine were unclear. 
In the two studies that investigated intravenous lidocaine compared to epidural analgesia (102 participants), the effect on pain at 24 and 48 hours, and on the time to first bowel movement, remains unclear. The effect of lidocaine on the risk of stopping the passage of food in the gut and for postoperative nausea is also unclear, as only one small trial assessed these outcomes. Neither study investigated the effect on pain immediately after surgery, or on opioid consumption. Both studies looked at adverse effects associated with lidocaine, but the effect is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of evidence for most outcomes as very low. This was because of inconsistent findings across studies and the fact that the evidence came from small studies that were of moderate design quality or a limited number of studies. The quality of the evidence for minimal or no effect on pain at 24 and 48 hours was moderate quality. The studies involved a variety of surgical procedures. The dose of lidocaine used, and how long it was delivered for after the end of surgery, also varied between studies.
