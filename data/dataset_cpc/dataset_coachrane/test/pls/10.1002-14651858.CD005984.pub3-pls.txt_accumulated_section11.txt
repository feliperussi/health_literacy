Enteral nutrition (liquid feeds) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines that frequently occurs in the lower part of the small intestine (ileum). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms the disease is considered 'active'. When the symptoms stop, it is called 'remission'. When people in remission experience symptoms it is called a 'relapse'. 
What is enteral nutrition? 
Enteral nutrition is a feeding method where a person's daily caloric intake is delivered via a liquid diet using the GI tract. Enteral nutrition can be administered by mouth or by tube feeding, where a tube is inserted through the nose or abdomen into the stomach to deliver the liquid feed. Enteral nutrition is a form of nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease patients. The mechanism by which enteral nutrition may influence inflammation is unknown and is being studied. Enteral nutrition can be classified as elemental and non‐elemental (semi‐elemental and polymeric) diets. Elemental diets are composed of amino‐acids (organic compounds), fats, sugars, vitamins and minerals. Elemental diets are easily absorbed and digested. Non‐elemental diets are based on oligopeptide (organic compounds composed of 2 to 20 amino‐acids) or whole protein sources. Non‐elemental diets are best for people who can digest and absorb nutrients without difficulty. 
What is 6‐mercaptopurine? 
6‐Mercaptopurine is an immunosuppressive drug that is thought to reduce inflammation in people with Crohn's disease by blocking the immune system. 
What is mesalamine? 
Mesalamine is a 5‐aminosalicylic acid drug. 5‐Aminosalicylic drugs are thought to treat Crohn's disease by reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. These drugs are usually taken by mouth. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether enteral nutrition helps to maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease. The researchers also investigated whether one type of enteral nutrition was better than another (e.g. elemental vs.non‐elemental) for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease.
