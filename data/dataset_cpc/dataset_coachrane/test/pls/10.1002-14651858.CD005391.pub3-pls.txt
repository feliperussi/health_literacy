Workload and surgeon´s speciality for outcome after colorectal cancer surgery
There is some evidence to suggest better patient outcomes with increasing healthcare provider volume in complex cancer surgery. At present, healthcare providers are unsure of this relationship for colorectal cancer patients and there are mixed views on the concentration of such services to higher volume institutions. Some of the consequences of service centralization would include the loss of local healthcare provision for some patients, and the threat to financial viability of smaller hospitals often relying on a regular income from such a common condition. After thorough search of the available literature, we found fifty‐four observational studies (fifty one meta‐analysed) including 943,728 patients that addressed either the volume‐outcome relationship in the context of modern colorectal cancer treatment, or the effects of surgeon specialization. The results confirm the presence of a volume‐outcome relationship in colorectal cancer surgery, based on hospital and surgeon caseload, and benefits for specialization. For death within five years of treatment, hospital volume appeared to be more beneficial in rectal cancer surgery than for colon cancer. However, international differences in the data suggest provider variability at the hospital level between the different countries, making it imperative that every country or healthcare system must establish audit systems to guide changes in the service provision based on local data, and facilitate centralization of services as required. Overall quality of the evidence was low as all included studies were observational by design. In addition there were discrepancies in the definitions of caseload and colorectal specialist. However ethical challenges associated with the conception of randomised controlled trials addressing the volume outcome relationship makes this the best available evidence.
