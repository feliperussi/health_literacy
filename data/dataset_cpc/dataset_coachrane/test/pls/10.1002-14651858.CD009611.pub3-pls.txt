Is taking inhaled corticosteroids only when asthma symptoms get worse as safe and effective as taking inhaled corticosteroids every day? 
Chronic asthma is a disease caused by underlying inflammation in the airways (the small tubes in the lungs) and asthma attacks occur when the airways contract making it difficult for the person to breath. In people with mild asthma, inhaled corticosteroids are often recommended to be taken every day to control the underlying inflammation. However, many people with asthma take inhaled corticosteroids only when symptoms appear. We wanted to look for the available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the use of inhaled corticosteroids everyday with use of these drugs only at the time of worsening of symptoms in children and adults with persistent asthma (six trials representing 1211 patients). 
This review of randomised controlled trials found no significant difference in the number of asthma attacks of moderate severity between people taking inhaled corticosteroids every day and those taking them 'as needed'. However, there was not enough information to conclude to that the two approaches were equivalent. We found that people taking inhaled corticosteroids everyday had slightly better asthma control with better lung function, less use of reliever medication and more symptom‚Äêfree days than those taking inhaled corticosteroids intermittently. We also observed that compared to intermittent inhaled corticosteroids, children grew slightly less with daily inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone (inhaled corticosteroids are known to affect growth), underlying the importance of using the safest and lowest effective dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We did not observe any significant group difference in the rate of withdrawals or adverse effects. These results do not provide firm conclusions, although the improvement in asthma control, lung function and airway inflammation would provide slightly greater support for the use of inhaled corticosteroids every day as compared to taking them only when symptoms get worse. Physicians and patients are advised to weigh the risks and benefits of each treatment option carefully and monitor the response of individual patients to adjust therapy as needed.
