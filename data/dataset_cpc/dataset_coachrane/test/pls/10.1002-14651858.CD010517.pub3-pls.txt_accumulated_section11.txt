Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. 
Background 
Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‐ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen.

Study characteristics 
One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‐ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). 
Key results 
The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‐low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia.
