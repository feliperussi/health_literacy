Is bed sharing an effective and safe method in the care of healthy term neonates?
Review question: we wanted to find out if bed sharing is associated with an increase in the duration and frequency of breastfeeding in babies who are born after 37 weeks of pregnancy (also known as term neonates) and are healthy at birth. 
Background: 'bed sharing' is a type of sleeping practice in which the sleeping surface (e.g. bed, couch or armchair, or some other sleeping surface) is shared between the infant and another person. The possible reasons that families choose to bed share include: ease in breastfeeding; temperature regulation (avoidance of hypothermia); spending quality time with the infant; helping the infant sleep and being able to easily comfort the infant in case they become agitated; being able to attend to them quickly in case of any mishap; providing close care during an illness; and promotion of bonding. However, for many families worldwide, the practice of bed sharing is not a choice. In high‐income countries, bed sharing is regarded as a controversial practice, and has drawn special attention with regard to its role in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). But in low‐ and middle‐income countries, bed sharing has been the standard practice for many groups who could not afford different sleeping surfaces. In these less rich societies, bed sharing is believed to contribute to: longer durations of breastfeeding; increased time and duration of infant arousals; decreased time and duration spent in deep sleep; and increases in the mother’s awareness of the infant's condition. 
Study characteristics: we searched for studies up to 23 July 2020. The aim of the review was to include randomised controlled studies (RCTS). RCTs are clinical studies where participants are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. We planned to include RCTs of term neonates who started to bed share with the mother within 24 hours of birth (and continued to bed share with the mother in the first four weeks of life, followed by a variable time period after). We aimed to compare a 'bed sharing' group to a 'no bed sharing' group. During bed sharing, there is close contact between the mother and infant. The possible physiological benefits include better temperature regulation with less risk of hypothermia, and a longer duration of successful breastfeeding. The harms include sudden infant death as a result of the mother lying on the infant, and use of pillows and comforters.
