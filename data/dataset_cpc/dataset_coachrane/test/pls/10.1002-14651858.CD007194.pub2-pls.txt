Debriefing interventions for the prevention of psychological trauma in women following childbirth 
Why is this review important? 
Having a baby is a complex life event. While many women view their experiences of giving birth as very positive, childbirth can sometimes be experienced as a traumatic event. If a birth is experienced as traumatic, it could have a negative impact on a woman's long‐term emotional well‐being. Relationships between mother and child may be affected, as can the women's relationships with other family members. One intervention that is commonly used with the aim of reducing psychological trauma (that is anxiety, trauma or depressive symptoms) and preventing the development of post‐traumatic stress disorder following birth is debriefing. Debriefing includes a variety of post‐birth discussions that provide women an opportunity to talk about their birth experience. In this review we examined the evidence for debriefing as a preventative intervention for psychological trauma following childbirth. 
Who may be interested in this review? 
‐ Women who have recently given birth, their families and friends.
‐ Midwives, health visitors and other medical professionals who have close contact with women who are pregnant or have just given birth. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
Is debriefing more or less effective than standard postnatal care in preventing psychological trauma among women who have recently given birth. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases to find all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) published before 4 March 2015 that investigated debriefing for the prevention of psychological trauma in women following childbirth. We included seven studies with a total of 3596 women. The studies were published between 1998 and 2005 and all were conducted in high‐income countries (UK, Australia and Sweden). 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There was no evidence of a difference between debriefing and standard postnatal care in preventing psychological trauma up to three months post‐birth or at three to six months after birth. We did not find any information to tell us whether debriefing led to women leaving the studies early. The quality of the evidence presented in the included studies was generally low. There were a number of limitations in the way the studies were designed (for example some had small sample sizes) and reported (for example incomplete data were presented). Further well‐designed studies are needed for us to more clearly understand whether debriefing can minimise the psychological impact of a traumatic birth experience and ensure that it poses no harmful effects.
