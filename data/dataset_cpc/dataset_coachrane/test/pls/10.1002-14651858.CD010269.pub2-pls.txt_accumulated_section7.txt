Dexmedetomidine and clonidine for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine and clonidine (known as alpha‐2 agonists) for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Background 
Sedation is an important treatment for critically ill patients who need a machine to support breathing, because it reduces anxiety and stress and facilitates the delivery of nursing care. However, some commonly‐used sedatives, such as propofol, midazolam and lorazepam, might decrease blood pressure, depress breathing, and delay awakening after a long‐term infusion. They may prolong breathing support time and length of stay in hospital. Dexmedetomidine and clonidine sedate but allow staff to interact with patients, and they ease pain but do not depress breathing. Those treated with them could be more easy to awake, and more able to communicate their discomfort and pain. These drugs are therefore attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation, and we planned to assess their efficacy and safety for long‐term (more than 24 hours) sedation, compared with traditional sedatives. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the databases until October 2014. We included seven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1624 participants, comparing dexmedetomidine versus traditional sedatives. All the studies required participants to have an anticipated need for sedation of more than 24 hours. The alternative sedatives included propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. We found no eligible studies in children or for clonidine. Of the seven studies, six were funded by the drug manufacturer, and one did not state any conflict of interest.
