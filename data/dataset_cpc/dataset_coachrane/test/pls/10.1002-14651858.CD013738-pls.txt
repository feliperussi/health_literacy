Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads
Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required
