The effect of long‐term red blood cell transfusions on chronic chest complications of sickle cell disease 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence to see if regular long‐term red blood cell transfusions helped to reduce the occurrence or progression of chronic chest complications compared to hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), any other treatment or standard care in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Oxygen is transported from our lungs to all parts of our body by haemoglobin, which is a major component of red blood cells. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of haemoglobin. In people with sickle cell disease red blood cells become rigid once they have given up their oxygen and are often shaped like crescents. These rigid cells can block blood vessels, which causes problems throughout the body, including the lungs. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the lungs). High blood pressure in these arteries are associated with an increased risk of death. Chronic sickle lung disease arises as a result of lung damage and loss of lung tissue. 
Regular blood transfusions for people with sickle cell disease reduce the amount of the person's own sickled cells in their blood by replacing them with donated, non‐sickled cells. Regular transfusions have already been shown to reduce the risk of strokes in people with sickle cell disease. We aimed to find out if regular long‐term blood transfusions in people with this disease lead to a reduction in new chronic chest complications or slowed the progression of any chronic chest complications that have already developed. We also aimed to consider death rates due to chronic chest complications and any adverse effects of the transfusion programme. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 19 September 2019. We found no studies in this update of the review. 
Key results 
There are no results because we found no relevant randomised controlled trials. We would need to design a study with at least 946 participants to be able to detect a decrease in the number of people who died from 12 in 100 to six in 100. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to answer our review questions.
