Hydrogel dressings for venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether hydrogel dressings are any more effective for healing of venous leg ulcers than other types of dressing such as gauze and saline, alginate, manuka honey or hydrocolloid. There was not enough information to be sure how hydrogel dressings compare with other dressings in terms of potential side effects. 
What are venous leg ulcers? 
Venous leg ulcers are wounds or sores on the leg caused by alterations in the circulation of blood in the veins. They are hard‐to‐heal wounds. Venous leg ulcers may cause pain, itching and swelling. There may be changes to the skin around the ulcer, and it may also produce fluids. The standard treatment for this type of wound is compression therapy (bandages or stockings) to improve blood flow in the legs. Dressings are applied underneath compression bandages to protect the wound and aid healing. Different types of dressings vary in their ability to: maintain a moist environment; absorb excess fluid from the wound; soften dead tissue; cushion the wound; keep the wound clean and free of germs and keep newly healed skin intact. Hydrogel dressings are filled with a watery gel and can be used to keep the wound moist; they are intended to help remove dead tissue and help healthy skin to grow. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if hydrogel dressings compared to other dressings:
– heal venous leg ulcers;
– have any unwanted effects;
– have any effect on changes in ulcer size, time‐to‐ulcer healing or recurrence of ulcers; 
– improve people's quality of life;
– reduce pain;
– impact the costs of treatment.
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature and collected and analysed all relevant randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment people receive is chosen at random) to answer this question. This type of trial provides the most reliable health evidence. There were no restrictions on publication language, settings where treatments were used, or sex or age of the participants, as long as they had venous leg ulcers. We excluded trials evaluating hydrogel dressings impregnated with antimicrobial (which reduce the presence of bacteria), antiseptic (which stop or slow down the growth of germs) or analgesic (painkiller) agents as these interventions are evaluated in other Cochrane Reviews.
