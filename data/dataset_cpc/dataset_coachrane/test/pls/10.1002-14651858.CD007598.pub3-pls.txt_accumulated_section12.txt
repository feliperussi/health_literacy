Aromatherapy for treating postoperative nausea and vomiting
Review question 
This review sought to evaluate the effect of aromatherapy on the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting experienced by some people immediately after having surgery. 
Background 
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common side effect following surgery, with up to a third of all patients suffering moderate to severe nausea and vomiting following general anaesthesia using inhaled anaesthetics. Nausea is an abdominal discomfort or queasiness that may be accompanied by vomiting. Current pharmaceutical treatments do not always work effectively for people or they may have unpleasant adverse effects. Aromatherapy involves inhalation of the vapour of essential oils or other substances to treat or alleviate physical and emotional symptoms. Aromatherapy is sometimes recommended for treating nausea and vomiting, although currently there is not sufficient evidence to show it is effective. This review is an update of a review previously published in 2012. 
Study characteristics 
We examined a total of 16 controlled clinical studies using aromatherapy for PONV with a total of 1036 participants (seven new studies from the March 2017 searches were added to nine studies from the original review). The participants were adults except for two studies in children. The studies applied aromatherapy at the first complaint of nausea in the immediate period after surgery and measured nausea for up to two days. Aromatherapy substances used were isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), peppermint oil, ginger, or mixtures that included ginger, spearmint, peppermint and cardamom; or lavender, peppermint, ginger, and spearmint oils. 
The studies compared aromatherapy to saline or water placebo, controlled breathing, other aromatherapy substances, anti‐nausea medications, or a combination of these, with some studies having up to four groups. 
Key results 
Overall, aromatherapy was not effective in reducing nausea severity at greater than three minutes after treatment in comparison to saline, water or controlled breathing placebo (6 studies with 241 participants) but more participants who received aromatherapy were nausea‐free at the end of treatment (4 studies, 193 participants) and fewer participants who received aromatherapy required anti‐nausea medications (7 studies with 609 participants). 
Peppermint oil did not show an effect on nausea severity at five minutes after treatment (4 studies, 115 participants). 
We could not pool data for a comparison of isopropyl alcohol to standard anti‐nausea medications for nausea severity. In terms of nausea duration, the time to 50% relief of symptoms was faster with isopropyl alcohol vapour than with standard antiemetics (ondansetron and promethazine) (3 studies, 176 participants). Aromatherapy using isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation provided rapid, short‐term relief of nausea and reduced the need for rescue anti‐nausea drugs (4 studies, 215 participants). Patient satisfaction with aromatherapy appeared high in the four studies that measured this outcome.
