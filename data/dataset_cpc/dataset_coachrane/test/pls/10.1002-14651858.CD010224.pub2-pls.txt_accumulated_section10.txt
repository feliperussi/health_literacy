Treatment for epilepsy in pregnant women and the physical health of the child
Background 
For most women who have epilepsy, continuing their medication during pregnancy is important for their health. Over the last 25 years, research has shown that children exposed to these medications in the womb can be at a higher risk of having a malformation or birth defect. 
Research question 
This review aimed to understand whether exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of having a child with a malformation. 
Characteristics of the studies 
The review included 50 published studies. We compared the children of women with epilepsy who were taking a single AED to the children of women without epilepsy or women who had epilepsy but who were not treating it with AEDs. We also made comparisons between children exposed to different AEDs in the womb. The evidence presented in this review was up to date in September 2015. 
Results 
The amount of data available from the studies reviewed varied greatly by the AED under investigation, and this could account for some of the findings. 
‚Äê Children exposed to valproate compared to other AEDs had the highest level of risk of a malformation at 10.93%. The children exposed to valproate had a higher level of risk than both groups of control children and than children exposed to carbamazepine, gabapentin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and zonisamide. The level of risk of having a malformation was linked to the amount or dose of valproate the child was exposed to in the womb.
