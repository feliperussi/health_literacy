Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with asthma
Take‚Äêhome message 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may improve the quality of life and asthma control of adults with asthma, but there is limited evidence for other important outcomes, and our confidence in the results is quite low. None of the studies included adolescents with asthma. 
Review question 
We wanted to review the evidence of the effect of CBT compared to usual care (without CBT) on a range of health outcomes in people with asthma including quality of life, medication adherence, and levels of anxiety and depression. 
Background 
People with asthma suffer from anxiety and depression more than the general public. These psychological problems are linked with having worse asthma, including having poorer control of symptoms and being admitted to hospital more often. CBT is a talking therapy that aims to help people recognise how their behaviour affects their thoughts and feelings, which may help people with asthma better cope with their condition. We wanted to learn whether using CBT was better than not using CBT for improving the lives of people with asthma. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence reviewed is current to August 2016. We included nine studies with a total of 407 participants in the review. All of the participants had asthma. In three of the nine studies, the participants also had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both. The CBT was given either individually or in a group and ranged from four to 15 sessions. 
Key results 
Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and on measures of asthma control compared to participants who did not receive CBT. The studies generally did not report whether CBT reduced the likelihood of people needing oral steroids for an asthma attack. The benefit on AQLQ score was sustained up to a year after receiving CBT. Participants given CBT also had better anxiety scores compared to those given usual care. Participants given CBT did not have clearly improved depression scale scores or medication adherence. 
The overall quality of evidence presented is low due to the small number of studies included in the review, the differences in the design of the studies and in how the CBT was conducted, and because the participants knew to which treatment group (CBT or no CBT) they had been assigned.
