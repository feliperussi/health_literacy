Dressings and securement for central venous catheters (CVCs)
Background 
A central venous catheter (CVC) is a tube that is inserted into a blood vessel to enable the delivery of liquid nutrition, blood, medicine or fluids (or a combination of these) to a person who is ill. If a CVC is in place the patient does not need to suffer repeated needle insertions when treatments are due, as tubes can be attached to the CVC, the required fluid pumped in, and then the tubes detached when appropriate. 
CVCs need to be secured adequately, usually with a dressing of some kind, in order to prevent them from becoming dislodged and to avoid infection (for example, catheter‐related bloodstream infections (BSI)), and need to be comfortable for the patient. Many different types of products are available to secure CVCs, but it is not known which works best. 
Review question 
The objective of this research was to compare the available dressings and securement devices for CVCs to identify which works best. 
What we found 
The researchers searched medical databases up to September 2014, and identified 22 studies with a total of 7436 participants that were relevant to the research question. The studies investigated the following comparisons: 
‐ nine studies compared sterile gauze with standard polyurethane dressings; ‐ six studies compared standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate‐impregnated dressings (chlorhexidine gluconate is an antibacterial disinfectant); ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with silver‐impregnated dressings (silver compounds may have antibacterial properties); ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with hydrocolloid dressings; ‐ one study compared 'modern' gas permeable standard polyurethane dressings with 'old' (original) standard polyurethane dressings; ‐ one study compared highly adhesive transparent standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate dressings; ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with sutureless (stitchless) securement devices; ‐ one study compared sterile gauze with no dressing; and ‐ one study compared chlorhexidine gluconate dressings with no dressings. 
The included studies sometimes did not clearly report the methods they had used to minimise accidental or statistical error, but overall the methods were adequate. 
Analysis of the study results showed that there is high quality evidence that securing a CVC with a dressing impregnated with a medication (chlorhexidine gluconate‐impregnated or silver) reduces catheter‐related blood stream infection compared with a dressing without medication. The results indicated moderate quality evidence for a reduction in the frequency of catheter‐related BSI per 1000 patient days (this is a unit used in research that represents patient use; in this case 1000 patient days is equal to 1000 patients using CVCs for one day, or 500 patients using CVCs for two days, or 250 patients using CVCs for four days, etc.) when a chlorhexidine gluconate‐impregnated dressing was used rather than a standard polyurethane dressing. When the risk of infection with chlorhexidine gluconate‐impregnated dressings was compared with the risk with standard polyurethane dressings in another way (by calculating the ratio of the risk of infection with one versus the other without taking account to patient days of use) this difference was less clear. A less direct measure of infection, that is the extent of bacterial colonisation of the tip of the catheter after removal, showed more bacteria with the standard polyurethane dressing (moderate quality evidence). 
The studies that contributed to this research were mainly carried out in intensive care unit settings, where a large number of CVCs are used for short durations. Other types of dressings and securement products for CVCs that were investigated by the studies analysed here did not show any observable effects on catheter‐related BSI, catheter tip colonisation or any of the other outcomes assessed, such as skin irritation, failed catheter securement, condition of the dressing and patient death. 
More, high quality research is needed to investigate the relative effects of the wide range of dressing and securement products that are available for CVCs.
