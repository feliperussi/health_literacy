Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for women with biopsy‐proven endometriosis
Review question 
Cochrane Review authors reviewed the evidence on efficacy and safety of drugs called selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for women with biopsy‐proven endometriosis. 
Background 
Endometriosis is a disease that affects 1 in 10 women of reproductive age. Endometriosis can cause abdominal and menstrual pain and infertility. Spreading and activity of the disease are dependent on the hormone oestrogen. Medical treatment consists of pain medication to relieve symptoms, oral contraceptive pills to suppress the menstrual cycle, or other hormonal treatments such as progestogen medication or hormonal intrauterine devices. SERMs aim to block the effects of oestrogen and could offer promise as medical treatment for endometriosis. We compared the effects and safety of SERMs versus placebo or other treatment for endometriosis. 
Study characteristics 
Only one randomised controlled trial was included in this review. This study compared the SERM 'raloxifene' versus placebo in 93 women who had undergone complete surgical excision of all endometriosis lesions. Evidence is current to 28 May 2020. 
Key results  
The included study did not report the primary outcome of pain relief. Adverse events such as pelvic pain, ovarian cyst, headache, migraine, and depression did not differ between study groups. We are uncertain whether raloxifene improves adverse outcomes when compared with placebo (1 study, 93 women; very low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether raloxifene improves the recurrence rate of endometriosis, as proven by biopsy, when compared to placebo (1 study, 93 women; very low‐quality evidence). This suggests that if 28% of women taking placebo have biopsy‐proven recurrence of endometriosis pelvic pain, between 19% and 62% of those taking raloxifene will do so. These outcomes are limited, as not all women had an actual second laparoscopy to take biopsy samples. However, study authors reported that women in the raloxifene group were likely to experience return of pain sooner than women in the placebo group. The included study reported that quality of life measurements did not differ between raloxifene and placebo groups, except in the domain of mental health. By 12 months, mental health quality of life scores favoured placebo treatment (mean difference 11.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 21.19). There were no usable data on fertility nor on economic outcomes.  
Based on the single study included in this review, reviewers found no evidence of a beneficial effect of SERMs as treatment for pain relief in surgically treated endometriosis. On the contrary, the study was prematurely stopped because women who used SERMs experienced a return of pain sooner than women who used placebo.
