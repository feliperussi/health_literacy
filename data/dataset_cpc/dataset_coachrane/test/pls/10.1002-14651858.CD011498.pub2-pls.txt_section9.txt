Most information was from trials that compared chemoradiotherapy with surgery. There was no difference in long‐term deaths between chemoradiotherapy and surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery. More people died in radiotherapy than surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery in the long‐term. There was no difference in long‐term cancer recurrence between non‐surgical treatment and surgery. The difference between non‐surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for short‐term deaths, the percentage of participants with serious adverse in three months, and the percentage of participants who had recurrence of cancer in and around the food‐pipe. The health‐related quality of life (covering aspects such as activity, daily living, health, support of family and friends, and outlook) was higher in non‐surgical treatment between four weeks and three months after treatment, although it is unclear what this difference means to the patient. The difference between non‐surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for medium‐term health‐related quality of life (three months to two years after treatment). Chemoradiotherapy only appears to be at least equivalent to surgery in terms of short‐term and long‐term survival in people with one type of oesophageal cancer called squamous cell cancer and who are fit for surgery. There is more uncertainty in the comparison of chemoradiotherapy only versus surgery for another type of oesophageal cancer called adenocarcinoma, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of definitive chemoradiotherapy versus surgery in this type of oesophageal cancer. More people had difficulty in swallowing prior to their death after chemoradiotherapy treatment compared to surgical treatment.
