Routine invasive versus conservative strategies for unstable angina and non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction in the stent era 
Background 
People with prolonged or recurrent chest pain may have a condition called unstable angina (UA) or suffer a certain type of heart attack called non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). People with either of these two conditions may be managed by either one of two treatment strategies: the routine invasive strategy, or the conservative or 'selective invasive strategy'. With the first approach, patients have a catheter (a long, patent tube) inserted into the arteries that bring blood to the heart muscle itself, called the coronary arteries. The main objective behind inserting this catheter (in other words, to perform a procedure called coronary angiography) is to look for thickening and hardening of the vessel. If a significant narrowing or a complicated plaque is found, then the artery may be dilated by inserting a balloon catheter that can be inflated wherever the vessel is particularly narrow, so as to open the vessel and improve blood flow. The vessel is held open by inserting a metallic stent. In some cases, the region of vessel narrowing is not amenable to this approach and surgery to bypass it is required. With the other, conservative or 'selective invasive' strategy, patients are initially treated with drugs, and only those who continue to suffer further chest pain or who demonstrate evidence of ongoing coronary artery narrowing via other non‐invasive tests, such as stress testing or imaging, undergo coronary angiography and revascularisation if indicated. In this Cochrane review, researchers examined the available evidence to determine which strategy is better. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomised controlled trials that compared routine invasive strategies to conservative strategies in patients with UA and NSTEMI in the stent era. We searched the available literature up to 25 August 2015. 
Key results 
We included eight studies with 8915 participants: five trials were in the review version published in 2010, and three were new trials. Of the included participants with UA and NSTEMI, there were 4545 in the invasive strategy arm and 4370 in the conservative strategy arm. Evidence failed to show appreciable risk reduction in all‐cause mortality and death or non‐fatal myocardial infarction (MI) with routine invasive management strategy compared to conservative strategies. There was appreciable risk reduction in MI, refractory angina and re‐hospitalisation with routine invasive strategies compared to conservative strategies, but this was associated with an increased risk of procedure‐related MI and bleeding complications.
