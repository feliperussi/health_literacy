In stable COPD, should inhaled corticosteroids be used with combination long‐acting beta2‐agonist/long‐acting muscarinic antagonist inhalers? 
Why is this question important? 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is a common long‐term lung disease often associated with smoking. Patients with COPD experience persistent symptoms including breathlessness, cough and phlegm production. COPD is commonly treated with a number of inhaled medications. These include long‐acting bronchodilators (LABA and LAMA) that open (dilate) the airways; and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which are medications that suppress inflammation in the airways. In some individuals with particularly persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations (episodes where their symptoms become worse), all three classes of these inhaled medications are used. 
LABA and LAMA bronchodilators are now available in single combination inhalers. These combination inhalers have been found to improve adherence and patient outcomes. Presently, it is unclear whether using an ICS in addition to these new combination LABA/LAMA inhalers provides any additional therapeutic benefit or risk of side‐effects. 
How did we answer this question? 
We looked for all studies which compared treatment of stable COPD with ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers against combination LABA/LAMA inhalers alone. This process involved a detailed search of multiple electronic databases for trials up to 9 December 2015. 
What did we find? 
Our review did not identify any studies assessing the relative benefits and risks of these two treatment strategies. 
Conclusion 
No relevant trials have been published to date. We cannot confirm any benefit from this review of adding ICS to a combination LABA/LAMA inhaler for the treatment of stable COPD.
