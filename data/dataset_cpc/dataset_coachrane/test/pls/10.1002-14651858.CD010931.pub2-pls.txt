Risk of endometrial cancer in subfertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation
Background  For the treatment of subfertility (delay in becoming pregnant), several medications are used to stimulate ovulation ‐ the process of maturation and release of eggs from the ovaries. These drugs may also affect the endometrium, which is the layer of tissue lining of the womb (uterus). However, conditions that cause subfertility are known risk factors for endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) while pregnancy and combined oral contraceptive pills have a protective effect, significantly reducing the risk of endometrial cancer. Separating causative effect of medicines used to treat subfertility from other underlying causes, which may increase the individual's risk of endometrial cancer, is therefore extremely challenging. 
The aim of the review  To find out whether the medicines used to stimulate ovulation increase the risk of endometrial cancer in women who need medical help to get pregnant. 
Key results  The evidence is current to July 2016. Nineteen studies, including 1,937,880 participants, were identified that compared the risk of developing cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer) in women exposed to ovary‐stimulating drugs versus either subfertile women not exposed to these drugs, or women from the general population. Overall, exposure to clomiphene citrate, mainly in high dosage and in repeated cycles, may be associated with an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer later in life. The evidence about the relationship between exposure to gonadotropins and endometrial cancer was less robust. It is not possible to say whether the increased risk is due to ovulation‐stimulating drug use or to the underlying cause of subfertility. 
Quality of the evidence  The quality of the evidence for the findings was very low, as the included studies had severe limitations and multiple differences in the way they were conducted. 
What are the conclusions?  Women who need treatment with clomiphene citrate should be aware that they are at increased risk of endometrial cancer, but this is largely due to underlying condition causing subfertility and it is not possible to assess the additional effect of clomiphene citrate, based on available data.
