Does hormone therapy help transgender women undergoing gender reassignment to transition?
Background 
Transgender women may feel that they have been born in a body with the wrong sexual characteristics. This may result in significant psychological distress (gender dysphoria) and the desire to adapt their male physical and sexual characteristics to be more consistent with their experienced female gender. This is a process called transition. If measures to aid transition are not taken, this can result in greater psychological distress. One of the medical treatments given to help transgender women with male bodies to achieve transition is synthetic female hormones. These hormones can be taken by mouth, absorbed through the skin or injected into muscle. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included transgender women (age 16 and over) in transition from male to female. RCTs are a type of research study that can reduce the possibility of several types of bias. To be included in this review, studies needed to compare different hormone treatments used to support transgender women to transition (oestrogen alone, testosterone blockers alone, or oestrogen in combination with testosterone blockers), or compare these hormone treatments to placebos (fake or dummy treatments that appear to be the same as the actual treatment, but have no medical effects). We wanted to see whether hormone treatments help transgender women to make a transition that they are happy with. We also wanted to look at whether there were any health risks of the treatment. 
Key results 
We searched for studies up to 19 December 2019. We were unable to find any relevant completed studies that we could include. We did find one ongoing study that aimed to recruit all of the people taking part in the study by the end of 2020. This study is comparing the effects of estradiol valerate plus cyproterone treatment with estradiol valerate plus spironolactone treatment in transitioning transgender women in Thailand.
