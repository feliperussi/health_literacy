Advance provision of misoprostol to pregnant women for preventing and treating excessive blood loss after birth 
We set out to determine the safety and effectiveness of giving pregnant women a medication called misoprostol to keep, so they have it ready to prevent or treat excessive bleeding immediately after birth. 
What is the issue? 
The medications oxytocin and ergometrine are commonly used to help reduce blood loss in the first 24 hours after giving birth. These require a trained health professional to be present as they are given by injection immediately after the birth. They also need to be kept in the refrigerator to remain effective. 
Misoprostol is another medication that helps the womb to contract strongly after birth and reduce excess bleeding. It can be given by mouth and does not need refrigeration. This makes it easier to use than oxytocin and ergometrine, in parts of the world where refrigeration and trained health professionals are not readily available. The main side effects of misoprostol are generally self‐limiting and do not require treatment with further medication. 
Why is this important? 
Excessive blood loss, or postpartum haemorrhage, remains the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Most of these deaths occur in remote settings in Africa and Asia, where resources are poor and home births without a skilled birth attendant are common. 
Having misoprostol available for use by pregnant women and community and lay health workers could be a way of avoiding excessive blood loss and death after giving birth. Misoprostol may, however, cause harm to women and their babies if used for other purposes such as to start labour before its natural onset. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 19 December 2019. We identified two studies from rural Uganda involving 3214 women who were randomised (assigned by chance) to receive and keep misoprostol tablets or receive standard care for preventing excessive bleeding after birth. However, only 570 of the women enrolled in these studies gave birth outside of a health facility, which is what we were investigating. 
We were unable to analyse most of the information from one study as it was not separated out by birth setting (health facility versus non‐facility) and not well adjusted for the type of study design. Therefore, the analysed information in our review largely reflects the findings of one study. 
No serious maternal ill health or deaths were reported in the two studies. One of the main outcomes of the review, blood loss of at least 1000 mL, was not reported. Other results were from one of the studies (299 women) that used a placebo (dummy pill) in the group who did not receive misoprostol. The certainty of the evidence was very low and the findings were variable. It is unclear whether giving women misoprostol in advance affected the number of women who used misoprostol, used it correctly and appropriately, or were referred to a health facility. The number of women who experienced side effects, and newborns with poor outcomes, was not clearly different between those who received misoprostol in advance and those who received standard care. 
What does this mean? 
Although this update supports the feasibility of a strategy of giving women misoprostol tablets to use after birth outside of a health facility, the evidence on the benefits of this approach remains uncertain. Efforts to scale up this strategy as part of reducing maternal deaths in remote regions should be done cautiously through targeted monitoring and evaluation, or with large‐scale research to resolve the uncertainties.
