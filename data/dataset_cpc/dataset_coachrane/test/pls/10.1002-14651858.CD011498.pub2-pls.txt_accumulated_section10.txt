Non‐surgical treatment versus surgical treatment for oesophageal (gullet or food‐pipe) cancer 
Review question 
Is non‐surgical treatment equivalent to surgical treatment for treatment of people with oesophageal cancer (cancer of the gullet or food pipe)? 
Background 
Oesophageal cancer is the sixth most frequent cause of cancer‐related death in the world and is becoming more common. Treatment and survival depends upon the extent of cancer. When the cancer is limited to the gullet and the person is fit to undergo major surgery, surgical removal of the oesophagus (oesophagectomy) is currently the recommended treatment. Additional chemotherapy (use of chemicals to selectively destroy cancer) and radiotherapy (use of X‐rays to destroy cancer) may be given in addition to surgery in some people with oesophageal cancer. However chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of the two (chemoradiotherapy) can be used alone without surgery but are currently only recommended in people who are unfit for major surgery because of their general condition. Chemoradiotherapy on its own may cause such side effects as severe kidney damage, infection, and vomiting, but is less invasive than oesophagectomy, and may result in a shorter hospital stay and reduced risk of death. Oesophagectomy may carry the significant potential side effects of surgical site infection, the narrowing and breakdown of tissue where the cut end of the oesophagus is joined to the bowel, pneumonia, and difficulty swallowing. The death rate may also be higher, particularly when performed in smaller centres. It is unclear whether non‐surgical treatment may be as effective as surgery in cure of cancer. 
Study characteristics 
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review, and seven studies provided information for the review. The non‐surgical treatment was chemoradiotherapy only in five studies and radiotherapy only in three studies. We included a total of 1114 participants undergoing non‐surgical treatment (510 participants) or surgical treatment (604 participants) in the various analysis in the seven studies that provided information. Methods similar toÂ tossingÂ a coin were used to decide whether a participant received non‐surgical treatment or surgical treatment and ensure that the participants in the two groups were similar. Most trials included people who were healthy in aspects other than the condition requiring surgery. The evidence is current up to 4th March 2016. 
Key results 
Most information was from trials that compared chemoradiotherapy with surgery. There was no difference in long‐term deaths between chemoradiotherapy and surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery. More people died in radiotherapy than surgery in people with oesophageal cancer who are fit for surgery in the long‐term. There was no difference in long‐term cancer recurrence between non‐surgical treatment and surgery. The difference between non‐surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for short‐term deaths, the percentage of participants with serious adverse in three months, and the percentage of participants who had recurrence of cancer in and around the food‐pipe. The health‐related quality of life (covering aspects such as activity, daily living, health, support of family and friends, and outlook) was higher in non‐surgical treatment between four weeks and three months after treatment, although it is unclear what this difference means to the patient. The difference between non‐surgical and surgical treatments were imprecise for medium‐term health‐related quality of life (three months to two years after treatment). Chemoradiotherapy only appears to be at least equivalent to surgery in terms of short‐term and long‐term survival in people with one type of oesophageal cancer called squamous cell cancer and who are fit for surgery. There is more uncertainty in the comparison of chemoradiotherapy only versus surgery for another type of oesophageal cancer called adenocarcinoma, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of definitive chemoradiotherapy versus surgery in this type of oesophageal cancer. More people had difficulty in swallowing prior to their death after chemoradiotherapy treatment compared to surgical treatment. 
Radiotherapy only results in less long‐term survival than surgery (about 40% increase risk of deaths). Further well‐designed studies that measure outcomes that are important for patients are necessary.
