No evidence of benefit of partial liquid ventilation in adults with acute lung injury and some evidence of increased risk associated with its use 
Seriously ill adults can get a severe lung disease called acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which stops enough oxygen from getting into the blood. About half of these patients die, and for those who survive, it can take several years to get back to near normal. 
At the height of their illness, many of these patients are unable to breathe properly and need the assistance of a breathing machine called a ventilator, which pushes gas into the lungs under pressure through a process called artifical ventilation. Artifical ventilation can cause further damage to the lungs. The need to support breathing for these patients, while avoiding further lung damage, has led to a search for gentler types of ventilation. 
One such gentler type of ventilation is called partial liquid ventilation. It uses a special liquid called perfluorocarbon instead of the gas used by traditional ventilators. 
The purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether patients with acute lung injury who received partial liquid ventilation were less likely to die or were more likely to recover completely than those who received traditional gas ventilation. 
To provide the best possible answer to this question, this review was conducted in a special preplanned way with the intention of putting together the results of all selected studies to produce an overall measure of the value of partial liquid ventilation. Two eligible studies (including a total of 401 participants) were found, and a comparison was made between those who received similar doses of perfluorocarbon and those who received traditional ventilation. No evidence indicated that partial liquid ventilation reduced the risk of death or the duration of artifical ventilation, and some evidence suggested that it may increase the risk of complications, including low blood oxygen levels, low heart rate, low blood pressure, air leakage from the lungs and cardiac collapse.
