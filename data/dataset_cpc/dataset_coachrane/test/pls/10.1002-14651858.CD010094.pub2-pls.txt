Radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease
Review question 
Is radioiodine treatment better than antithyroid drugs for the therapy of Graves' disease? 
Background 
Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the body's immune systems attacks the body itself by means of antibodies. These antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland to produce and secrete excessive amounts of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Other typical characteristics of Graves' disease are goitre and eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy). Currently, antithyroid medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil and radioactive iodine (radioiodine, given either in a capsule or in a tasteless solution in water) are most often used for the treatment of Graves' disease. Radioiodine destroys most cells in the thyroid gland, so that secretion of thyroid hormones is massively reduced. Antithyroid medications block the production of thyroid hormones, also leading to a decrease in the production of these hormones. 
Study characteristics 
We identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling 425 adult participants with Graves' disease. Altogether 204 participants were randomised to treatment with radioiodine and 221 to methimazole. Follow‐up in the included studies was from 2 to 21 years depending on which outcome was investigated. 
Key results 
Study authors reported health‐related quality of life to be similar in the radioiodine and methimazole treatment groups, however exact data were not published. 
The development and worsening of Graves' opthalmopathy, which is a serious eye disease that happens in some people with Graves' disease, was observed in 361 of 1000 radioiodine‐treated persons compared with 186 of 1000 methimazole‐treated persons. A high percentage of the study participants were smokers, which is related to the risk of worsening or development of Graves' opthalmopathy. 
A normal thyroid gland function (euthyroidism) was not achieved by any participant who was treated with radioiodine compared with 64 of 68 participants (94%) after methimazole treatment. In this study thyroid hormone (thyroxine) therapy was not started early in both treatment arms to accomplish euthyroidism. 
A recurrence of hyperthyroidism (relapse of the disease) was seen more often after methimazole treatment, however the size of the effect is unclear because of big differences between the two included studies. 
A side effect related to radioiodine therapy was an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), which was seen in 39 of 41 participants (95%) compared with 0% of participants receiving methimazole. Again, in this study thyroxine therapy, with the aim to avoid hypothyroidism, was not given early in the radioiodine group. Side effects related to methimazole treatment were seen in 23 of 215 participants (11%). The outcomes death from any cause and bone mineral density were not reported in the included studies. 
One study reported socioeconomic effects: costs based on the official hospital reimbursement system in Sweden for people without relapse and methimazole treatment were between USD 1126 and USD 1164, and for radioiodine treatment USD 1862. Costs for people with relapse and methimazole treatment were between USD 1972 and USD 2284, and for radioiodine treatment USD 2760. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low mainly because there were just one or two studies per outcome and the number of participants was small. Another limitation is that among antithyroid medications only methimazole was investigated, which might limit the applicability of our findings with regard to other medications such as propylthiouracil. 
Currentness of evidence 
This evidence is up to date as of September 2015.
