Cervical stitch (cerclage) in combination with other treatments for preventing premature or early birth of single babies 
We assessed randomised controlled trial evidence on the effects of cervical stitch in combination with other treatments for prolonging pregnancy in women who were at high risk of pregnancy loss and were carrying a single baby. Additional treatments were used in the same time period as when the cervical stitch was surgically inserted. 
What is the issue? 
The cervix is a cylinder‐shaped neck of tissue connecting the vagina and uterus (womb). The cervix should stayed closed during pregnancy, but some pregnant women have cervical weakness resulting in pain‐free opening of the cervix. This may lead to a late miscarriage or preterm birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy. A cervical stitch is a surgical procedure performed in the second trimester to place a stitch around the cervical neck with the intention of helping the woman carry the pregnancy until around 37 weeks. Other treatments that can be combined with cervical stitch include antibiotics, vaginal support inserts (pessaries), placement of a second cervical stitch, uterine relaxants (tocolytics), progesterone (hormonal drugs), omega‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and bed rest. 
Why is this important? 
Cervical weakness is diagnosed through a woman’s history of pregnancy losses or premature births in the second trimester, ultrasound examination or physical examination. Preventing preterm birth is a healthcare priority because it is the leading cause of infant ill health and death worldwide. A cervical stitch in combination with other treatments could help prevent preterm birth in women carrying a single baby as a single stitch may not be sufficient for pregnant women with prior premature births and short cervical length or weakness. 
What was studied in the review? 
We wanted to know whether a cervical stitch, in addition to one of a range of treatments (antibiotics administration, a vaginal pessary, reinforcing or second cervical stitch placement, a uterine relaxant or progesterone) can prolong pregnancy for women carrying a single baby who are at high risk of pregnancy loss. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched the literature for evidence from randomised controlled trials up until 26 September 2019. We identified two trials involving a total of 73 women. Only one trial with 50 mother‐baby pairs had results that could be included in this review. The trial compared cervical cerclage in combination with indomethacin (tocolytic) and the antibiotics cefazolin or clindamycin with cervical cerclage alone. Women were not blinded to the treatment they received. 
We are unclear about the effects of the intervention because we identified very low‐certainty evidence for the main outcomes in this review: serious complications; loss of the baby (data for miscarriage and stillbirth only ‐ data were not available for the numbers of babies who died within 28 days of being born), or preterm birth before 34 completed weeks of pregnancy. There were no stillbirths (death within the womb at 24 or more weeks). 
Data for death of the newborn baby at discharge, or the number of babies discharged home healthy were not available. 
What does this mean? 
We found insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of combining a tocolytic (indomethacin) and antibiotics (cefazolin/clindamycin) with inserting a cervical stitch compared with inserting a cervical stitch alone for preventing spontaneous preterm labour in women with singleton pregnancies. 
We did not identify any studies looking at other treatments in combination with inserting a cervical stitch. Additional research needs to focus on the role of other interventions such as a vaginal support pessary (device), reinforcing or second cervical stitch placement, 17‐alpha‐hydroxyprogesterone caproate, dydrogesterone or vaginal micronised progesterone, omega‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and bed rest.
