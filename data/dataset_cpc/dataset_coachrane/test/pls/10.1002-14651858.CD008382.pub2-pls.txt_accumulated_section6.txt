Very early discharge versus early discharge versus non‐early discharge in children with cancer and fever during neutropenia 
Review question  In this review of the literature we aimed to determine whether early discharge (less than five days, on average) from in‐hospital treatment, for a selected group of children, is not inferior to non‐early discharge (five days or more, on average) in children with cancer and fever during neutropenia. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate whether very early discharge (less than 24 hours, on average) is not inferior to early discharge, and whether very early discharge is not inferior to non‐early discharge. 
Background  Treatment with chemotherapy can cause a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) in children with cancer. Due to the high risk of bacterial infections and of a sudden and severe course of infections, standard care for children with cancer and fever during neutropenia consists of routine hospitalization and intravenous administration of broad‐spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that act against a wide range of disease‐causing bacteria). However, causes of fever during neutropenia can be less serious; in a subgroup of these children lengthy in‐hospital treatment might be unnecessary. 
Study characteristics  The evidence is current to December 2015. The current review identified one study, Santolaya 2004, in which early discharge was compared to non‐early discharge in this group of children, and one study, Brack 2012, in which very early discharge was compared to early discharge. 
Key results  Early discharge did not appear to be less safe than non‐early discharge in children with cancer and fever during neutropenia with a low risk for bacterial infections; there was no clear evidence of difference in treatment failure between the two groups. Moreover, the treatment costs in the early discharge group were lower than in the non‐early discharge group. Regarding very early discharge, this did not appear to be less safe than early discharge; there was no clear evidence of difference in treatment failure between the two groups. Duration of treatment differed between very early discharge and early discharge; duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment was shorter in the very early discharge group, and duration of oral antibiotic treatment was shorter in the early discharge group, as compared to one another. However, there was no clear evidence of difference in total treatment duration of any antibiotic treatment between these groups. 
Quality of the evidence  For both reported comparisons, the quality of the evidence was low. The included studies were relatively small with a low number of participants, thus it was possible that the absence of clear evidence of differences in the included studies could be due to, for example, the lack of power. Unfortunately, it was not possible to pool data in the two studies.
