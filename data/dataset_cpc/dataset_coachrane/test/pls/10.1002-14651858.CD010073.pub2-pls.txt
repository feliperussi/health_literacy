Relaxin for preventing preterm birth for women in preterm labour
Preterm labour (contractions of the uterus and changes in the cervix before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) can lead to preterm (early) birth of the baby. Preterm birth is a leading cause of illness and death for newborn babies. Tocolytic agents are used to prevent uterine contractions and can help to delay birth. Relaxin is a hormone that is produced by the ovary and placenta with important effects in the female reproductive system and during pregnancy. This review aimed to assess whether relaxin given to mothers in preterm labour could delay or prevent preterm birth. 
We included three small randomised trials involving 149 women in preterm labour in the review. These trials were conducted in the 1950s and had a high risk of bias overall. We found no convincing evidence that relaxin (given by intravenous and intramuscular injection) can prevent preterm birth for women in preterm labour. Only one of the studies, involving 30 women (and at a high risk of bias), reported on birth within seven days of treatment and found that women who received relaxin were less likely to give birth preterm within seven days of treatment, and were more likely to have a longer pregnancy than women who did not receive relaxin. The risk of babies dying was not significantly different between the women who received relaxin and those who did not. Neither of the other two trials found clear differences in preterm birth, and no trial reported on longer‚Äêterm outcomes for the babies. There is therefore insufficient evidence from this review to recommend relaxin as an intervention to prevent preterm birth for women in preterm labour.
