Prevention of dementia and decline in cognition by using multi‐domain interventions
Review question 
Can cognitive decline and dementia be prevented by interventions which target two or more risk factors for dementia? 
Background 
Dementia is a condition in which memory and other thinking skills (known as cognition, or cognitive functioning) decline to the point that they affect a person’s ability to be fully independent in their daily activities. It can be caused be a variety of different brain problems, most of which become increasingly common with age. Although the risk of dementia increases for everyone as they get older, not everyone is at equal risk.  A number of risk factors have been identified that make dementia more likely. These include high blood pressure in middle age, diabetes, smoking, drinking a lot of alcohol and lack of exercise. If these risk factors are addressed, then it might be possible to prevent some cognitive decline and dementia, or at least to delay its onset. Because dementia is a complex condition and there are many different risk factors, it may not be very effective to target only one risk factor. In this review, we are interested in interventions which aim to modify at least two risk factors; these are known as multi‐domain interventions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 28 April 2021 for studies in which people without dementia were randomly assigned to a multi‐domain intervention or to usual health care (for example general health advice) and the groups were later compared by counting the number of people who had developed dementia or by measuring cognitive functioning. We found nine studies with a total of 18,452 participants. The average age of the participants was 68 years. The studies differed in several important ways, including in the risk factors they tried to modify, in how long the interventions lasted (from 1 year up to 10 years), and in the tests used to measure cognitive functioning.  All of the studies took place in high‐ or middle‐income countries in which usual health care was probably of a good standard. 
Key results 
Only two studies counted the number of people who developed dementia. Older adults receiving a multi‐domain intervention were no more or less likely to develop dementia than those receiving usual care. Multi‐domain interventions probably slightly improved cognitive functioning when this was measured with a long, detailed test, although we did not find any effect in studies that measured cognitive functioning with a short, screening test (the Mini‐Mental State Examination, MMSE).  The studies that found a benefit mostly offered cognitive training within the multi‐domain intervention, making it possible that some of the effect could have been due to people getting better at performing cognitive tests, instead of being due to a real improvement in cognitive functioning that would be apparent in daily life. The effect was also stronger among participants who had an increased genetic risk for dementia (people carrying the ApoE4 gene). None of the studies reported harmful effects of the interventions.  
We found that most studies were well‐conducted. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was moderate to high, which means we are moderately to very confident in our results.
