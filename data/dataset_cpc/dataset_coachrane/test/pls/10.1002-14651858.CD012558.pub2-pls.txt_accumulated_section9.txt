Why is improving dementia diagnosis important?
Dementia refers to a group of brain conditions that lead to progressive problems with memory, working‐things‐out, or functioning in everyday life. Doctors use a variety of tests to diagnose dementia. People have often reported that it can take a long time to get a diagnosis of dementia from initially presenting to a healthcare provider with symptoms suggestive of dementia. 
Cognitive impairment is a broader term that includes people whose brain is not functioning as well as expected given their age, but they do not have dementia, as well as people with dementia. Some people with cognitive impairment who do not have dementia may have a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Some people with MCI (but not all) will develop dementia over time. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The review authors aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical judgement of general practitioners (GPs) for diagnosing dementia, and cognitive impairment, in primary care. 
What was studied in the review? 
The authors included extracted data from 11 studies, including 10 with complete data on diagnostic accuracy. The authors included eight studies in the statistical summary with a total of 2790 people, of whom 826 (30%) had dementia. The authors included four studies that investigated cognitive impairment as the condition to diagnose, with a total of 1497 people of whom 594 had cognitive impairment (40%). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The results of the review indicate that in theory, if GPs used their clinical judgement in practice for dementia, they would correctly identify 58% of the people who have dementia as having the condition (sensitivity) and 89% of the people who do not have dementia as being free of the condition (specificity).
