Metabolomics for improving pregnancy outcomes
Review question 
Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of metabolomics as an evaluation tool to improve the rates of ongoing pregnancy, live birth, and miscarriage in women who were undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART). 
Background 
Metabolomics is the scientific study of the chemical 'fingerprints' that biological cells, tissues, or organs produce after various cellular processes. They have been proposed as a powerful non‐traumatic method to assess the quality of oocytes, viability of embryos, and receptivity of the endometrium in subfertile women undergoing ART. The final aim of their use is to overcome the high incidence of multiple births and to enhance the performance of ART. However, evidence on their use remains contradictory. Therefore, it was important to evaluate the current evidence on the effectiveness of metabolomics versus conventional techniques (such as the assessment by morphology only) in providing sufficient information on the adequacy of the physiology and function of embryos, oocytes and endometrium, to facilitate targeted subfertility treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We found four randomised controlled trials, with a total of 924 women, that compared metabolomic profile assessment with morphology assessment of embryos. The women were an average age of 33 years old. All studies were conducted between 2011 and 2013; length of follow‐up was not specified in any of them. The evidence is current to 26 Feburary 2018. 
Study funding sources 
One study was supported by an unconditional grant from a biotechnology company (Molecular Biometrics Inc.). The very low conditional superiority for the primary outcome and premature termination of the trial were potentially associated with the funder's interest in the results. One study received funding from a national health organisation, but the equipment was provided by Molecular Biometrics Inc., one was self‐funded, while the source of funding was not stated in the fourth study.
