The effect of type of surgery for outcome in low‐grade chondrosarcoma
Background and review question Chondrosarcomas are one of the most common types of bone cancer, with varying degrees of severity. These tumours grow from cartilage forming cells, within the bone, or on the surface of the bone. Low‐grade chondrosarcomas (LGCS) are tumours that grow slowly over time and do not generally metastasize and people do not usually die from this disease. In the late 20th century, the condition was treated by cutting out large portions of bone surrounding the tumour (wide resection). However, surgeons today more commonly treat these tumours by scraping the tumour out of the bone (intralesional treatment). In this way, the bone structure is preserved and more extensive surgery can be avoided. Therefore, people are potentially less disabled and complications can be reduced. This is only appropriate if the survival outcome of the cancer treatment is not compromised compared to wide resection. We reviewed the evidence for the harms and benefits of both types of surgery on outcomes in people with LGCS, including tumour recurrence after surgery (local recurrence), level of physical functioning and complications after surgery. 
Search date The evidence is current to April 2018. 
Study characteristics We identified 14 studies that were suitable for analysis with a total of 511 participants; 92 were treated by wide resection compared to 419 by intralesional treatment. Age of the participants varied from 13 to 82 years with a mean age of 48 years. Women outnumbered men in the studies by just over one and a half times, which reflects that LGCS are more common in women. People were followed‐up for between 24 to 300 months after surgery. In addition, there were four studies including 270 participants, from which we could not extract the exact data, but were used to confirm the statistical analysis.
