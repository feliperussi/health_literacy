Controlled hypotension versus normotensive resuscitation strategy for people with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 
Background 
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart and through the abdomen to the rest of the body. It can develop in both men and women. A growing aneurysm can burst (rupture), which leads to massive blood loss and shock. It is frequently fatal and accounts for the death of at least 45 people per 100,000 population. 
One option to fix a ruptured AAA is to open the abdomen and place a tube graft in the aorta (open repair); the second approach is to place a stent graft inside the aorta through the large artery in the thigh (femoral artery; endovascular repair). 
This review focused on the initial management of bleeding and low blood pressure caused by the ruptured aneurysms, also known as haemorrhagic shock. Patients are generally given intravenous (giving medicines or fluids through a needle or tube inserted into a vein) saline solutions in the emergency room or surgery centre to restore circulatory volume. 
Rapid fluid replacement immediately restores normal blood pressure. It is known as the normotensive resuscitation strategy and can lead to an increase in bleeding because the clot can be removed and coagulation factors in the blood can be diluted. An alternative approach is the controlled (permissive) hypotension resuscitation strategy. This strategy consists of fluid replacement, the use of drugs, or both, to keep systolic blood pressure between 50 mmHg and 100 mmHg, until the aneurysms can be repaired with open surgery or endovascular repair. This strategy might work because it does not introduce a large volume of cool saline solution and consequently avoids the outcomes listed above. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared strategies to manage haemorrhagic shock and to restore normal blood pressure initially, and during surgery, in patients with ruptured AAA. Our searches up to August 2017, did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups; one of which is the control group) meeting our criteria. Studies are needed to help emergency physicians, vascular surgeons, and anaesthesiologists choose the best option for treating haemorrhagic shock caused by ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no randomised controlled trials that met our criteria.
