Immunosuppressants to prevent corneal graft rejection after penetrating keratoplasty
Background  The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that if damaged, can be replaced by a corneal transplant (keratoplasty) using healthy cornea tissue from a donor. A penetrating keratoplastyinvolves replacing all the damaged cornea. It is necessary to prevent the transplanted material (graft) from being rejected. The current strategies for preventing graft rejection are topical and oral steroids. The use of cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), sirolimus, and leflunomide is increasing. However, the benefits and adverse reactions of these immunosuppressants have not yet been systematically reviewed. 
Search date  The evidence is up to date to May 2015. 
Key findings  We included six randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 561 people. The trials were conducted in Germany (three trials), Iran, India, and China. 
In people with high‐risk keratoplasty, one study compared systemic MMF with placebo, one study compared systemic MMF with systemic CsA, and one study compared CsA eye drops versus placebo. 
In people with normal‐risk keratoplasty, one study compared tacrolimus eye drops to steroid eye drops, and two studies compared CsA eye drops to placebo in people experiencing rejection after keratoplasty. All studies reported clear graft survival, incidence of graft rejection, and adverse effects. 
We are uncertain as to the effects of immunosuppressants in the prevention of graft failure and rejection after high‐ and normal‐risk keratoplasty, as the number of trials is limited, and, in general, the trials are small and at risk of bias. Future trials should be large enough to detect important clinical effects, conducted with a view to minimising the risk of bias, and they should measure outcomes important to patients. 
Study funding sources  Three of the studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Quality of evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be low to moderate. There was risk of bias in the included studies; the results were sometimes imprecise because of the small number of studies and small number of people enrolled in these studies; and in some analyses the results of individual trials were inconsistent.
