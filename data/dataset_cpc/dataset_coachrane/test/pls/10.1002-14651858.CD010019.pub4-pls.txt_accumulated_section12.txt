Is home or hospital treatment better for people with blood clots in the lungs?
Key message 
We are uncertain if treatment in hospital or at home (outpatient) is better for some people with blood clots in the lungs. We did not find clear evidence of an important difference in the number of deaths, bleeding, recurrence of new blood clots, or patient satisfaction, because the results were imprecise and the studies did not report side effects on blood pressure or information on how well people followed medical advice. More well‐designed studies are needed before doctors can make informed practice decisions. 
Why is this question important? 
A blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) is a major cause of death and illness. These can occur after a blood clot breaks off from somewhere else in the body and travels in the blood to the lungs. The clot can often travel from the leg, where it is called a deep vein thrombosis. How people are treated depends on whether they are low‐risk or high‐risk, but most people are given blood‐thinning drugs (anticoagulants) in hospital. For some low‐risk cases with sudden onset (acute) pulmonary embolism, treatment at home might be better than keeping them in hospital. Possible benefits include fewer people in hospital, less risk of picking up an infection in hospital, cost savings, and better health‐related quality of life. We wanted to know if there were any differences in risks and benefits between people with blood clots in the lungs who are treated at home compared to those treated in the hospital. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that treated adults with sudden onset, low‐risk, pulmonary embolism at home or in hospital. In randomised controlled trials, the treatments people receive are decided at random, and these types of studies give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. 
What did we find? 
We found two studies involving 453 people with sudden onset pulmonary embolism who were treated at home or in hospital. One study used the same treatment for the people treated at home or in hospital, and the second study used different treatments. We did not find any clear differences in the number of deaths, bleeding, new clots, or patient satisfaction between the groups of people who were treated at home or in the hospital. 
Neither study provided information on side effects of the treatment or on whether people were able to follow the correct instructions at home. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are not very certain about the evidence from the two included studies. This is because there were only small numbers of people in the studies (and small numbers of events) and because we could not be sure that reports of studies where no effect was shown were ever published.
