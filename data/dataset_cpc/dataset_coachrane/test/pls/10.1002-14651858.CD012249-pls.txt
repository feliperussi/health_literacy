School‐based programs to improve birth control use among adolescents
Background 
Adolescents have high rates of unplanned pregnancy. They may not have family planning services nearby or know how to get modern birth control. We wanted to find programs in schools that helped teenagers learn about birth control. 
Methods 
We did computer searches for randomized trials until 6 June 2016. Programs included in this review must have occurred in a school, such as a middle school or high school. The programs tried to improve birth control use among teenagers. They also had to emphasize one or more methods of birth control known to work well. 
Results 
We found 11 trials. One study was small, and the other 10 had 816 to 10,954 participants. Six studies were from the USA, three were from the UK, and one each came from Mexico and South Africa. We focus here on three programs that had some effect and were good quality. All three involved students in a variety of activities versus usual sex education. After a two‐year program, the intervention group reported more use of birth control as well as condoms during last sex than the group with standard classes. Another study lasting two years provided two different programs. The intent was to avoid risk by not having sex until marriage or to reduce risk by delaying sex until older. The control group had usual health education. The programs for avoiding risk and reducing risk showed fewer reports of sex without using birth control or condoms. The third study had peers lead eight sessions of educational activities. The program showed less birth control use compared with teacher education but the researchers did not adjust for the study design. 
Of the other eight studies, one had good quality results. The intervention group knew the time limits for using emergency contraception. Six of seven studies with low or very low quality results reported some program effect, such as more condom or contraceptive use or more knowledge of condoms. 
Authors' conclusions 
Since most trials aimed to prevent STI/HIV and pregnancy, they focused on condom use. However, several studies covered a variety of birth control methods. The overall quality of results was low. Some trials lacked information on how their programs worked. Many analyzed subsamples rather than all students in the study, and most had high losses.
