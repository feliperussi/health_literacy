Joint corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis
Review question 
We searched the literature until 3 February 2015 for studies of the effects on pain, function, quality of life, and safety of intra‐articular (injected into the joint) corticosteroids compared with sham injection or no treatment in people with knee osteoarthritis. 
Background 
Osteoarthritis is a disease associated with a breakdown of cartilage of the joints, such as the knee. When the joint loses cartilage, the body responds by growing bone abnormally, which can result in the bone becoming misshapen and the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function and the ability to use the joint. 
Although osteoarthritis is generally thought to be of degenerative rather than inflammatory origin, an inflammatory component may be present at times. Intra‐articular corticosteroids are potent anti‐inflammatory agents injected inside the knee joint. 
Study characteristics 
After searching for all relevant studies to 3 February 2015, we found 27 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1767 participants, of a duration ranging from two weeks to one year. 
Key results 
Pain 
• People who received intra‐articular corticosteroids rated improvement in their pain to be about 3 on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain) after 1 month. • People who received a placebo rated improvement in their pain to be about 2 on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain) after 1 month. 
Another way of saying this is: • 44 people out of 100 who receive intra‐articular corticosteroids respond to treatment (44%). • 31 people out of 100 who receive a placebo respond to treatment (31%). • 13 more people respond to treatment with intra‐articular corticosteroids than with placebo (difference of 13%). 
Note that these numbers may considerably overestimate the true benefit due to the low quality of the evidence. 
Physical function 
• People who received intra‐articular corticosteroids rated improvement in their physical function to be about 2 on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 10 (extreme disability) after 1 month. • People who received a placebo rated improvement in their physical function to be about 1 on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 10 (extreme disability) after 1 month. 
Another way of saying this is:
• 36 people out of 100 who received intra‐articular corticosteroids respond to treatment (36%). • 26 people out of 100 who received a placebo respond to treatment (26%). • 10 more people respond to treatment with intra‐articular corticosteroids than with placebo (difference of 10%).
