Treatments applied to the skin for fungal infections of the groin and body
Background  Up to 20% of the world's population is affected by fungal skin infections of the groin ('jock' itch, or tinea cruris) or of the body (ringworm, or tinea corporis), which generally appear as red and itchy areas on the skin. Many topical (directly applied to the skin) treatments are available. 
Review question  Which topical treatments work best for 'jock' itch and ringworm? 
Study characteristics  We included 129 studies published up to August 2013 which examined 18,086 people. Participants included men and women of any age, although most were between 18 to 70 years old. There was considerable variation in the reporting quality of the studies. A quarter were partially funded by pharmaceutical companies, and it was unclear what impact this may have had on reporting of the results. 
Most studies appeared to be conducted within dermatology outpatient clinics. A range of treatments were evaluated, mostly in single studies. Most treatments were applied once or twice daily for between two and four weeks. Mycological cure (disappearance of fungal infection); and clinical cure (absence of symptoms such as redness and itchiness); were assessed in the majority of studies, along with side effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease recurrence and hardly any assessed the time to achieve clinical cure, or whether study participants considered they had been cured. 
Key results  Almost all treatments were effective at achieving both mycological and clinical cure, compared with placebo. 
We combined data for several outcomes in two individual treatments: terbinafine against placebo and naftifine against placebo. Both were shown to be effective treatments. 
We combined data on different groups of treatments. There was no difference in rate of mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines. Combinations of antifungal treatment with a topical corticosteroid achieved higher clinical cure rates, probably because the skin redness disappears sooner due to the effect of the corticosteroid. There was no evidence of any difference in the speed of resolution of fungal infection with these combination treatments. 
Quality of the evidence  The overall quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as low to very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to decide if one particular treatment is better than any of the others. All the treatments we evaluated reported low rates of mild side effects.
