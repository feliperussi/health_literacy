Prolonged lung inflation for resuscitation of babies at birth
Review question 
Does the use of prolonged (or sustained) lung inflation (> 1 second duration) rather than standard inflations (≤ 1 second) improve survival and other important outcomes among newly born babies receiving resuscitation at birth? 
Background 
At birth, the lungs are filled with fluid which must be replaced by air for babies to breathe properly. Some babies have difficulty establishing effective breathing at birth, and one in every 20 to 30 babies receives help to do so. A variety of devices are used to help babies begin normal breathing. Some of these devices allow caregivers to give long (or sustained) inflations. These sustained inflations may help inflate the lungs and may keep the lungs inflated better than if they are not used. 
Study characteristics 
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 10 studies enrolling 1467 infants. In all studies, babies were born before the due date (from 23 to 36 weeks of gestational age). The sustained inflation lasted between 15 and 20 seconds at pressure between 20 and 30 cmH₂O. Most studies provided one or more additional sustained inflations in cases of poor clinical response, for example persistent low heart rate. We analysed one study (which included only nine babies) separately because researchers combined use of sustained or standard inflations with chest compressions, an additional intervention that might help babies begin normal breathing. 
Key results 
The included studies showed no important differences among babies who received sustained versus standard inflations in terms of mortality, rate of intubation during the first three days of life, or chronic lung disease. Babies receiving sustained inflation at birth may spend fewer days on mechanical ventilation. The results of several ongoing studies might help us to determine whether sustained inflations are beneficial or harmful. At present we cannot exclude small to moderate differences between the two treatments. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence is low to moderate because only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies and some studies could have been better designed.
