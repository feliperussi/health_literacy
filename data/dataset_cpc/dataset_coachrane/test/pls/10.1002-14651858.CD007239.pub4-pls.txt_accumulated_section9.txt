Interventions for the prevention of mastitis following childbirth
We set out to look at the effectiveness of interventions used to prevent breastfeeding women developing inflammation of breast tissue known as mastitis. 
What is the issue? 
Mastitis is a common complication of breastfeeding. It causes considerable pain and suffering for women and may stop some mothers from breastfeeding their babies for as long as they would like. Several factors contribute to the development of mastitis, such as blocked ducts, the breasts being too full with milk, cracked nipples and the baby being unable to latch on correctly. Mastitis can occur in one or both breasts and be associated with a number of symptoms including breast pain, redness and swelling, and flu‐like symptoms. The symptoms can last from two to three days up to a couple of weeks or more. 
Why is this important? 
It is important to investigate treatments to prevent mastitis in order to maximise breastfeeding outcomes and duration. Breastfeeding has major health benefits for both babies and their mothers, and healthcare authorities and the World Health Organization recommend that newborn infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk until they are six months of age. We need to ensure mothers, and the doctors and midwives who care for them, know about the best interventions for preventing mastitis in order to help women breastfeed successfully for as long as they want. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials in October 2019 and identified 10 trials (involving 3034 breastfeeding women). Most trials reported how many women were diagnosed with mastitis but there was almost no information about adverse effects, breast pain, duration of breastfeeding, nipple damage, breast abscess or recurrence of mastitis. Some trials were industry funded. 
Three trials (1038 women) compared probiotics to placebo. Results for the biggest of these trials (639 women) are currently unavailable because of a contractual agreement between the probiotics supplier and the trialists. Probiotics may reduce the risk of mastitis compared with placebo (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if probiotics reduce the risk of breast pain or nipple damage because the certainty of evidence is very low.
