Visual or visual‐tactile examination for the diagnosis of dental caries
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? 
Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to minimise the number of false‐positive results when treatment may be given when caries is absent, and improved visual detection methods may reduce such occurrences. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate visual classification systems are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 67 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Two main visual classification systems were studied in this review: the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and the Ekstrand‐Ricketts‐Kidd (ERK) system. A third group of visual classifications is reported and labelled as 'Other' because the studies did not report what system was used. We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 67 studies with a total of 19,590 teeth. Some studies reported on more than one type of classification system, this gave us 71 sets of data to use. The results of these studies indicate that, in theory, if the visual classification systems were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination in a group of 1000 tooth sites/surfaces, of whom 350 (28%) have early tooth decay:
