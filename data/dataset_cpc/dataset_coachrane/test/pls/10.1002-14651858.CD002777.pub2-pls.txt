High versus low medium chain triglyceride content of formula for promoting short‐term growth of preterm infants 
Review question 
How does high versus low medium chain triglyceride content of formula impact short‐term growth of preterm infants? 
Background 
Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans. Fat provides about half of the energy source (calories) in human breast milk, mostly as long chain fatty acid triglycerides (LCTs). Nutrition is essential for growth, metabolism, and immunity. 
Impaired weight gain and growth in preterm infants are significantly associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Poor nutrition has been linked to inadequate head growth and thus poor psychomotor and mental skills, higher rates of cerebral palsy, and autism. 
As a way of improving growth, fat can be added to formula used to feed preterm infants who cannot be fed maternal or donor breast milk or who may require supplementation. Fats in formula can contain triglycerides with long chain fatty acids or shorter medium chain fatty acids (MCTs). MCTs are more easily absorbed by the newborn infant with an immature digestive system. LCTs are still important for development of visual acuity and development of cell membranes and the brain. 
Study characteristics 
We included 10 small studies that compared the effects of feeding high versus low MCT formulas (for a minimum of 5 days) on short‐term growth (weight, length, and head circumference gain) of preterm infants. These infants had a mean gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks, mean birth weight between 1 kg and 1.5 kg, and mean age of one to six weeks. The evidence is up to date as of September 2020. 
Key results 
The pattern of growth in infants fed high MCT versus low MCT formula shows little to no difference in any of the primary short‐term growth outcomes.  
Certainty of evidence 
We found little to no difference in short‐term growth outcomes among premature infants fed either low MCT or high MCT formulas. The small number of trials (10), each containing a small study population, may be responsible for lack of evidence of a difference. We found evidence of very low to low certainty. Certainty is defined as low if confidence in the result is limited, meaning the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants may be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty is defined as very low if there is little confidence in the estimate of effect, which is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review.
