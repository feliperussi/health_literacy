Side effects of nine commonly used biologics
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the side effects of biologics used for many conditions including inflammatory arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, cancer, and neurological conditions. We did not include studies on HIV/AIDS. The nine biologics we studied were: abatacept (Orencia®), adalimumab (Humira®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), etanercept (Enbrel®), golimumab (Simponi®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan or Mabthera®) and tocilizumab (Actmera®). 
The review shows that people using these biologics in the short term: 
‐ will probably be a little more likely to experience more serious infections or tuberculosis than people who take placebo (fake drug); 
‐ will probably be a little more likely to experience side effects or drop out of the study due to side effects than people who take placebo; 
‐ will probably not experience more serious side effects* (other than serious infections), cancer, or congestive heart failure than people who take placebo. 
(*A serious side effect is a life threatening adverse event that can result in death or hospitalization and disability or permanent damage). 
We do not have precise information about other possible side effects and complications, including rare or long‐term side effects. 
What are biologics? 
Biologics are a group of medications that suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation, even though suppressing the immune system can make it slightly harder to fight off infections. 
Best estimate of what happens to people who take biologics in the short term (range: 1 to 63 months) 
Serious side effects 
Among people who took any biologic, 127 out of 1,000 had serious side effects compared with 118 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (1% absolute harm). 
All side effects reported 
Among people who took any biologic, 770 out of 1,000 had side effects compared with 724 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (5% absolute harm). 
Drop‐out of study due to side effects 
Among people who took any biologic, 137 out of 1,000 dropped out of the study due to side effects compared with 98 people out of 1,000 who took placebo (4% absolute harm). 
Serious infections 
Among people who took any biologic, 35 people out of 1000 experienced serious infections compared with 26 people out of 1000 who took placebo (1% absolute harm). 
Tuberculosis 
Among people who took any biologic, 20 out of 10,000 had tuberculosis compared with 4 people out of 10,000 who took placebo (0.16% absolute harm). However, there were not many cases of tuberculosis so our confidence in this result is low.
