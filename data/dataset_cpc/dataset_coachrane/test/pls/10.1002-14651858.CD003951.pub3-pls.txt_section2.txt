The way an infant's blood is circulated changes soon after birth. Initially, premature infants have an opening (a patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) between the large blood vessel to the lungs and the large blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Early symptomatic treatment of PDA, when clinical signs first appear, helps reduce the amount of time an infant needs assisted breathing (mechanical ventilation) and the likelihood of chronic lung disease and damaging inflammation of the gut (necrotising enterocolitis). Standard therapy includes restricting fluids, diuretics and cyclooxygenase inhibitors like indomethacin or ibuprofen. The PDA is closed surgically if these medical treatments do not work. Only one randomised controlled study could be included in this review (including 154 preterm infants that needed breathing support). Indomethacin and surgery gave similar benefits. There were no differences in deaths during the hospital stay, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, cerebral or other bleeding. Surgery was more effective in closing the PDA (three needed to treat for one to benefit) but it was associated with complications (pneumothorax and retinopathy of prematurity). The one study found was carried out over 30 years ago. Clinical practice has changed a great deal and surgical closure of a PDA is safer. Therefore, whether the results of the study are applicable today is debatable. Updates of this review in July 2007 and February 2012 did not identify any additional randomised controlled studies for inclusion, but three observational studies indicated an increased risk for one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation: chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity and neurosensory impairment.
