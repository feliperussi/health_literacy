House dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for treating eczema
Background 
Eczema is an intensely itchy skin disease that tends to involve skin creases, such as the folds of the elbows or knees. It is a worldwide problem affecting 5% to 20% of children. Around 2% of adults have the condition, and many have a more chronic and severe form. As many as a third of people with eczema who have a positive test for allergy to house dust mite have reported worsening of eczema or respiratory symptoms when exposed to dust. Ways to reduce or avoid exposure to house dust mite, such as covers for mattresses and bedding, increased or high‚Äêquality vacuuming of carpets and mattresses, or sprays that kill the mites, could lessen the severity of eczema for those who are sensitive to house dust mite. In this review, we aimed to assess the effects of all house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures for the treatment of eczema. 
Review question 
Do house dust reduction and avoidance measures provide a successful way to treat eczema?
Study characteristics 
We found seven randomised controlled trials, which included 324 adults and children with eczema. We conducted the search up to 14 August 2014. Two of the seven trials included only children; four included children and adults; and one only included adults. Four of the seven trials compared treatments made up of multiple different house dust mite reduction and avoidance measures, and three trials tested a single treatment. The treatments were compared against other house dust mite reduction or avoidance treatments, no treatment, a placebo intervention (e.g., cotton bed covers), or standard care only.
