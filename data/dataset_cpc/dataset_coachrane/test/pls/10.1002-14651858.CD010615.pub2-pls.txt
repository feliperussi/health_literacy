Adding plerixafor to G‐CSF for stem cell mobilisation for autologous transplantation in people with certain cancers of the blood 
Review question 
We reviewed the existing literature regarding the efficacy and safety of additional plerixafor to granulocyte colony‐stimulating factors (G‐CSF) versus G‐CSF only for stem cell mobilisation in people with malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma, cancers of the blood. 
Background 
Malignant lymphoma can be differentiated into Hodgkin and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, and usually affects the lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow. An effective treatment option for non‐Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma is high‐dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. In autologous transplantation, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood prior to high‐dose chemotherapy, which must be mobilised from the bone marrow in the blood. A commonly used agent for stem cell mobilisation is G‐CSF. Recent studies have suggested that the addition of the new agent plerixafor, which was originally developed for the treatment of HIV infection, to G‐CSF could lead to higher stem cell harvest and thereby increase the probability of successful transplantation after chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched several medical databases and identified four randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. Two of the four studies terminated early due to low recruitment (14 participants included) and did not release any results. We were therefore unable to include them in our statistical analysis. The two published analysed trials included 600 participants with multiple myeloma and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma. In both studies, the experimental group received G‐CSF plus plerixafor subcutaneously, and the control group received G‐CSF plus placebo. Both trials were sponsored by Genzyme, the manufacturer of plerixafor. 
Key results 
We were able to conduct a meta‐analysis of the data of the two studies for the outcomes mortality at 12 months, successful stem cell collection, and adverse events. 
We found no evidence for a difference between the plerixafor and placebo group for the outcomes mortality at 12 months and adverse events during stem cell mobilisation period. 
The meta‐analysis showed an advantage for those participants randomised to plerixafor for the outcome successful stem cell collection. Furthermore, in both studies the time to collect a defined number of stem cells was significantly shorter in the plerixafor group compared to the placebo group. 
In the study that enrolled people with multiple myeloma, 95.9% of the participants in the plerixafor arm and 88.3% in the placebo arm underwent transplantation. In the study that examined people with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma, 90% of the participants in the plerixafor group and only 55.4% in the placebo group could be transplanted. It seems that especially people with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma benefit from the addition of plerixafor in terms of successful transplantation, but there was no evidence for a difference for time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in transplanted participants. 
None of the trials reported on quality of life or progression‐free survival.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was high for adverse events and successful stem cell collection and moderate for mortality at 12 months. The main limitation was a wide confidence interval.
