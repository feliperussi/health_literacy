Comparison of paravertebral anaesthesia to general anaesthesia for breast cancer surgery
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Surgical removal of the tumour is the main treatment; however, dissemination of cancer cells may occur due to tumour handling during surgery. The body's response to surgery (stress response or release of hormones and mediators) as well as drugs used to produce general anaesthesia (complete loss of consciousness), such as opioids and inhalational anaesthetics, can also depress immunity and promote cancer cell survival. 
Paravertebral anaesthesia acts by numbing the nerves on one side of the body and can allow surgery to be performed without general anaesthesia. The lightly sedated participant can report pain, cold, thirst, or hunger during or after surgery, allowing timely treatment. This, combined with pain relief produced by paravertebral anaesthesia, has the potential to improve immunity, reduce surgical stress, and improve quality of life and cancer‚Äêfree survival. 
Review question 
We collected and analysed data from all relevant studies to ascertain whether paravertebral anaesthesia would provide better quality of recovery and pain relief at rest and on movement, and to determine whether paravertebral anaesthesia would have any affect on mortality, compared to general anaesthesia. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomised controlled trials in which participants in one group received paravertebral anaesthesia with or without sedation and participants in the other group received general anaesthesia during breast cancer surgery. We did not include studies in which paravertebral anaesthesia was administered in addition to general anaesthesia and then this was compared to the use of general anaesthesia.
