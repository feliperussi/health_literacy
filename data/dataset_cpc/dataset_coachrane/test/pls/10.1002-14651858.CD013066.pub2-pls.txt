Citicoline for treating people with acute ischemic stroke
Review questionWhat is the clinical benefit and harm of citicoline compared with placebo or other standard treatment for treating people with acute ischemic stroke? 
BackgroundAcute ischemic stroke is defined as a sudden episode of disturbance of brain function caused by a blockage in the blood vessels of the brain. It is the leading cause of long窶人asting disability and the second major cause of death. Citicoline is a substance that may prevent the death of brain cells located close to the area of brain damage.

Study characteristicsWe included randomized controlled trials, both published and unpublished. We did not apply any limitation by language, country, or study design. We included people (adults or children) with acute ischemic stroke irrespective of the underlying cause. Stroke was based on the clinical diagnosis confirmed with brain scans. We included trials that compared citicoline with placebo, usual care, or other usual treatment. 
Key resultsWe identified 10 relevant trials that included 4281 participants; six trials were carried out in multiple centers and two were international. We considered most trials to be at high risk of bias and they included small numbers of participants. This raises the risk of over窶親stimating benefits and under窶親stimating harms. Trials tested citicoline given either by mouth or by injection. Citicoline did not seem to influence death or disability in daily activities, severe side窶親ffects, functional recovery, or neurological recovery. 
Quality of the evidenceRisks of bias, imprecision, and outcome reporting bias all make the quality of evidence low. None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. Researchers poorly reported harms caused by citicoline, so the profile of harms remains unclear.
