Endometrial preparation for egg donor recipients or for frozen embryo transfers
Review question 
What is the most effective method for endometrial preparation in women undergoing embryo transfers with frozen embryos or embryos derived from donor oocytes? 
Background 
Couples undergo infertility treatments due to male factor, female factors or unexplained infertility. After an unsuccessful fresh embryo transfer cycle, a frozen‐thawed embryo transfer can be performed when frozen embryos are available. Adequate hormonal preparation of the endometrium is of utmost importance for both egg donor and frozen embryo replacement cycles to provide the optimal chances of pregnancy. Many drugs and various modes of administration have been tried by several investigators in order to optimise implantation rates and consequently improve the success rates of the embryo transfer procedures: stimulated cycles (to generate endogenous oestradiol), programmed cycles (administering exogenous oestradiol) or natural cycles (allowing the ovaries to produce oestradiol without stimulation) are some of the options; avoiding spontaneous ovulation with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists could have some impact; or using some other drugs such as aspirin or steroids that could potentially enhance the endometrial receptivity were also evaluated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 randomised controlled trials comparing different interventions such as the dose and route of administration of oestrogens and progestogen, the use of drugs that stop the patient from ovulating prematurely (GnRH agonists), and the use of other medications to improve the endometrium in a total of 5426 women. The evidence is current to June 2020. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether a stimulated cycle (with letrozole) compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves live birth. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following a programmed cycle is assumed to be 24%, the chance following a stimulated cycle would be between 13% and 51%. We are also uncertain of the impact on miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness. A stimulated cycle may improve clinical pregnancy rate. Data were lacking on multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation and other adverse effects. 
We are uncertain whether a natural cycle improves the live birth rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness in comparison with a programmed cycle. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are uncertain if transdermal (delivered via the skin) oestrogens compared with oral (by mouth) oestrogens improve clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes in this comparison. 
Starting progestogen on the day of the donor oocyte retrieval or the day after probably increases the clinical pregnancy rate and probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate. We are uncertain if it reduces the miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes.
