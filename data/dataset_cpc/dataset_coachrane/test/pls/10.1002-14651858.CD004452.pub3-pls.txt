Oxytocin receptor antagonists for inhibiting preterm labour
Tocolytic drugs suppress preterm labour and have the potential to postpone preterm birth long enough to, hopefully, improve infant outcome. This may be by allowing normal growth and maturation of the baby, or by allowing time for administration of magnesium sulphate to reduce risk of cerebral palsy and corticosteroids to help the baby's lungs and other organs to mature. They may also provide the opportunity, if necessary, for the mother to be transferred to a hospital that has facilities to provide neonatal intensive care. However, prolonging pregnancy may instead have adverse outcomes for the baby and so it is important to assess infant outcomes alongside duration of pregnancy. Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) are a group of tocolytic drugs, and we undertook this review to see if ORAs prolonged pregnancy and improved outcomes for infants compared with no treatment or with other tocolytic drugs. 
The tocolytic drugs, atosiban and barusiban, were the only ORAs we found that had been studied in trials; some trials compared with no treatment and others compared atosiban with betamimetics (another group of tocolytic drugs). We identified 14 studies, involving 2485 women. We found that, although atosiban resulted in fewer maternal side effects than other tocolytic drugs (especially betamimetics), atosiban was not effective in delaying or preventing preterm birth or improving neonatal outcome, and may possibly contribute to poorer infant outcomes. Further well‚Äêdesigned studies would be helpful, especially in women with threatened preterm at low gestations where preterm birth puts babies at particularly high risk of death or disability. 
Atosiban is no better than placebo or other drugs in delaying or preventing preterm birth but it has fewer maternal side effects compared to other tocolytics.
