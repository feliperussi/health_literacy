Abacavir‐based triple nucleoside regimens for maintenance therapy in patients with HIV 
Regimen simplification can be defined as a change in established effective therapy to reduce pill burden and dosing frequency, to enhance tolerability, or to decrease specific food and fluid requirements. Many patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy may be considered candidates for a simplification strategy and, among them, those who have achieved virologic suppression. We have reviewed clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of abacavir‐containing triple nucleoside combination as a simplification therapy in HIV‐infected adult patients treated with a Protease‐Inhibitor (PI)‐containing regimen and  with undetectable viral load. Patients on a PI‐containing regimen had three possibilities: continue the PI regimen or switch to a simplification maintenance regimen with triple nucleoside combination (abacavir‐zidovudine‐lamivudine) or with non‐nucleoside (efavirenz or nevirapine) containing regimens. The review included 8 RCTs and 1675 HIV infected patients. Simplification with triple nucleoside regimen showed an overall failure rate comparable to that of  continuing  PI regimen or  to simplification with non‐nucleoside regimens. Rates of failure due to adverse events with triple nucleoside combinations were lower compared to controls, but the difference was not statistically significant. By contrast, rates of virologic failures   were more frequent with  triple nucleoside combination that with PI or NNRTI, but in both the comparisons the differences were  not statistically significant. Simplification with abacavir had a favourable and significant impact on lipid metabolism compared to control group. Simplification with triple nucleoside regimens should be still considered for individuals who are unable to tolerate or have contraindications to NNRTI or PI based regimens
