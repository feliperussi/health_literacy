Does cleaning hands with ash stop or reduce the spread of viral and bacterial infections compared with soap or other materials? 
Background 
Some infectious diseases are spread by airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, which can infect people who touch contaminated skin or surfaces. Washing hands with soap and water may prevent these diseases from spreading. People with no soap may use other materials like ash, mud, soil with or without water, or water alone, to clean their hands. Hand cleaning with ash (the solid remains from cooking stoves and fires) might work by rubbing away or inactivating the virus or bacteria. However, chemicals in the ash could also damage the skin. 
If ash is an effective hand cleanser, it could reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID‐19) and other infectious diseases in low‐income areas where soap is not widely available. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether people who use ash for hand cleaning are more or less likely to catch infectious diseases than people who use soap, water, mud or soil, or who do not clean their hands. We also wanted to know whether using ash causes unwanted effects, like sore hands or a rash. 
Our methods 
We looked for studies that examined hand cleaning with ash compared with soap, mud, soil, water only or no hand cleaning. To answer our questions, the studies could include adults and children and take place anywhere. 
COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed to answer this question quickly. This meant we shortened some steps of the normal Cochrane Review process. We could not find the full texts of five potentially relevant studies, or contact study authors for additional data. Although we searched several databases we may have missed some studies. We plan to include all relevant information in a future version of the review. 
Results 
We identified 14 studies that assessed ash for hand cleaning. Only one small study directly compared people chosen at random to use ash or soap or other materials (randomised studies produce the best evidence). The studies included people of all ages and mainly took place in low‐income, rural communities. Six studies provided information to help answer our question. 
One study investigated children who had been to hospital with diarrhoea compared with children who had not. Study authors looked at the hand washing area in the children’s houses to see how they cleaned their hands. They found that families that used ash for hand cleaning made a similar number of hospital visits for children with diarrhoea as those families that used soap.
