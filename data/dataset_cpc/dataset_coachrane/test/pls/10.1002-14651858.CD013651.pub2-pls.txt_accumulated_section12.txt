Interventions available during pandemics for heavy menstrual bleeding: an overview of Cochrane Reviews 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of treatments commonly available during pandemics for heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Background 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common gynaecological condition. Treatments that can continue during pandemics include: 
1. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example mefenamic acid or naproxen: these work by reducing prostaglandin levels, which reduces bleeding from the lining of the womb. NSAIDs can be taken as tablets. 
2. Antifibrinolytics, for example tranexamic acid: these work in reducing bleeding by inhibiting clot‐dissolving enzymes in the lining of the womb. Antifibrinolytics can be taken as tablets. 
3. Combined hormonal contraceptives, for example the combined oral contraceptive pill: these work by thinning the lining of the womb that is shed during menstrual periods. Combined hormonal contraceptives can be taken as tablets, or can be administered vaginally, using a vaginal ring. 
4. Progestogens, for example norethisterone: these work by thinning the lining of the womb that is shed during menstrual periods. Progestogens are tablets, which can be taken for 10 days of the menstrual cycle (short‐cycle), or for three to four weeks of the menstrual cycle (long‐cycle). 
We aimed to summarise the best evidence regarding their effectiveness and safety.
Study characteristics 
We included four Cochrane Reviews (44 randomised controlled trials, 3196 women), to June 2020. We identified 11 different comparisons, including NSAIDs compared with placebo (control tablet that has no effect), antifibrinolytics compared with placebo, and combined hormonal oral contraceptives compared with placebo. All reviews reported menstrual bleeding, quality of life, patient satisfaction, side effects, and serious adverse events. We rated all the reviews as high quality.
