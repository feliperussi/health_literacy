Preventive treatments for repeated episodes of cellulitis and erysipelas
Background 
Cellulitis and erysipelas are both bacterial infections of the skin that most commonly affect the leg. Erysipelas affects the upper layers of the skin, and cellulitis affects its deeper parts, but in practice it is often hard to tell the difference between them, so we consider them together for this review (and refer to them as 'cellulitis'). Up to 50% of people with cellulitis experience repeated episodes. Despite the burden of this condition, there is a lack of high‐certainty, evidence‐based information about the desirable treatment for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis. 
Review question 
What are the best available treatments to prevent repeated episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16 years compared to no treatment, placebo, another intervention, or the same intervention with a different plan of treatment, and what are their side effects? 
Study characteristics 
We searched relevant databases and registers up to June 2016. We identified six trials, with 573 participants, who had an average age between 50 and 70. Both genders were included, but there were nearly twice as many women. Five trials used antibiotic treatment (four penicillin and one erythromycin), which was compared to either no treatment or placebo, and one trial used selenium compared to physiological salt solution. Treatments lasted from six to 18 months. 
The most common setting was the hospital, and two studies were multicentre. The studies were conducted in the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. There was a small number of previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes in each study. The antibiotic trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in people with cellulitis of the legs, and the selenium trial assessed people with cellulitis of the arms. 
Key results 
Our main outcome was prevention of repeated episodes of cellulitis. Our other outcomes included the number of repeated attacks of cellulitis, time to next attack, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of antibiotic resistance, adverse reactions and death.
