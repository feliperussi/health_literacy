Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis
We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review.

Study characteristics 
This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. 
Key results 
There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children.
