Routine vaginal examinations in labour
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if routine vaginal examinations for assessing labour progress are effective and acceptable to women, and to compare the use of these examinations to other methods of assessing labour progress. 
Why is this important? 
Labour is usually monitored to ensure that it is progressing as expected, and that there are no signs of abnormal progress that might be harmful to mother or baby. The method most commonly used is routine vaginal examination (undertaken at regular time intervals), which provides information on how dilated the woman's cervix is and the position of the baby. Very slow labours can be a sign of underlying problems that may require interventions to speed up labour and birth (augmentation). However, slow labours can also be a normal variation of labour progress, and recent evidence suggests that if mother and baby are well, length of labour or cervical dilation alone should not be used to decide whether labour is progressing normally. 
Other methods to assess labour progress include the use of ultrasound, assessing how the mother behaves, and external physical signs of progress, such as a purple line that develops between the mother's buttocks as labour progresses. However, these methods are not standard practice. The most effective method to assess labour progress has not been established. 
Vaginal examinations can be uncomfortable, painful, and distressing. If slow but normal labours are misdiagnosed as being abnormal, this can lead to unnecessary interventions, such as augmentation or caesarean section. Some women may not want these interventions, and their use can cause emotional and physical harm. Misdiagnosis of labour progress either way can be physically and emotionally devastating. Women's views and experiences of the methods used to assess labour progress should be considered, alongside evidence of effectiveness. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched in February 2021 and included four studies, with data for 744 women and babies. Overall, the evidence was uncertain or very uncertain due to the study methods and the inclusion of small numbers of women and babies.
