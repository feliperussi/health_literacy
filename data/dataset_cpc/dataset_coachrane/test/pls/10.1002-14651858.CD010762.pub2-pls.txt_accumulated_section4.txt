Methods for assessing pre‐induction cervical ripening, the ability of the cervix to open in response to spontaneous uterine contractions 
In this review, researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration examined a comparison between the Bishop score and any other method for checking pre‐induction cervical ripening in women admitted for induction of labour. The Bishop score is the traditional method of determining the readiness of the cervix to open (dilate) before labour induction. It also assesses the position, softening and shortening of the cervix, and the location of the presenting part of the baby. After searching for relevant trials up to 31 March 2015, we included two randomised controlled trials that recruited 234 pregnant women. 
What are the methods for pre‐induction softening of the neck of womb and why is it important to soften the neck of womb before induction of labour? 
Induction of labour is the non‐natural process of starting labour in a pregnant woman after the age the baby is more likely to survive following delivery, when there is no clear evidence of serious onset of labour and the membranes covering the baby are unruptured. Induction of labour may be needed because of a problem in the mother, or her baby or both, and is carried out at or before the ninth (last) month of pregnancy. Obstetricians (specialist caring for pregnant women) have long known that for this to be successful, it is important that the uterine cervix (the neck of the womb) has the favourable characteristics that make it ready to go into the labour. The delivery method and total duration of labour are affected by many factors and cervical readiness (ripeness) is just one of these.
