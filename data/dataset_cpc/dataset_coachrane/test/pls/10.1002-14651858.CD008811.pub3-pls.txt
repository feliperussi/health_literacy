Comparison of two different methods of lens removal in cataract surgery, particularly relevant to lower income settings 
Review question  What is the best way of removing the lens in cataract surgery, especially in lower income settings? 
This review considers two ways of removing the lens. In manual small incision surgery (MSICS) the lens is broken up and removed through a small incision. In extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) the lens is removed through a larger incision. ECCE is the standard way of doing cataract surgery in lower income countries. 
Background  As people get older, the lens in the eye can become cloudy ‐ this is known as a cataract. Cataract is the most common cause of blindness in the world. Vision can be restored by surgery to remove the cloudy lens. The lens is replaced with a plastic lens. This is known as an intraocular lens or IOL. 
Study characteristics  We found three randomised controlled trials. The searches are up to date to September 23rd 2014. 
A total of 953 people with age‐related cataract in India and Nepal were randomly allocated to MSICS and ECCE in these trials. 
Key results  The data were limited. People whose lens was removed with MSICS were more likely to achieve good functional vision, however, overall not more than 50% of people achieved good functional vision in the two studies. 1.2% of people enrolled in two trials had a poor outcome after surgery with best‐corrected vision less than 6/60. There was no evidence of any difference between the two groups with respect to this outcome. Surgically induced astigmatism was more common with the ECCE procedure than MSICS in the two trials that reported this outcome. In one study there were more intra‐ and postoperative complications in the MSICS group. One study reported that the costs of the two procedures were similar. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low. There were only three studies and we could not combine the data because of differences in reporting and inconsistency between trials which meant that some of the results were imprecise.
