Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for treating people with transfusion‐dependent beta‐thalassaemia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) in people with transfusion‐dependent beta (β)‐thalassaemia. 
Background 
β‐thalassaemia is a blood disorder which is transferred by both parents to their children. In this condition less haemoglobin is produced. According to the WHO, almost 60,000 children with thalassaemia are born every year. Transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia is the severe form of β‐thalassaemia, in which symptoms are clearly visible in the first six months of life. It can be fatal if left untreated, i.e. with blood transfusions. However, blood transfusions increase the chance of life‐threatening viral infections and of iron overload in the body, which affects major organs. Medicines for removing iron from the body can reduce the risk of iron overload, but the cost of managing the disease can often become too high for individuals and their families. Hydroxyurea is reported to be effective in treating β‐thalassaemia as it increases haemoglobin (blood) production and its benefits have previously been demonstrated.

Study characteristics 
We found no trials for inclusion in the review.
Key results 
We found no eligible trials for inclusion in the review. Multicentre, randomised controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood transfusion and iron chelation) are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving average levels of haemoglobin, as well as for assessing whether treatment is cost‐effective.
