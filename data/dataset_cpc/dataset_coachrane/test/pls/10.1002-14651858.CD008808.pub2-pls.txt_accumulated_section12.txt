Non‐drug treatments for promoting sleep in adults in the intensive care unit
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on non‐pharmacological interventions (i.e. non‐drug treatments) for improving sleep in critically ill adults. 
Background 
Sleep is essential to enable adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) to recover from their illnesses. However, adults in the ICU often suffer from frequently disturbed sleep or a lack of sleep. The reasons for sleep disruption may include the underlying illness, uncomfortable therapy, psychological stress, or the ICU environment itself. 
Interventions for sleep promotion include pharmacological treatments and non‐pharmacological interventions. Medications may produce side effects, such as a reduced ability to think clearly and negative effects on breathing, and they can also interfere with normal sleep patterns and lead to a risk of tolerance or drug dependency . Therefore, non‐pharmacological interventions, such as noise reduction, music therapy, alternative and complementary therapies, and social support, have been sought and are recommended for improving sleep in critically ill adults. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to June 2014.
Study characteristics 
We found 30 trials, with a total of 1569 participants, and the interventions included changes to ventilator type and settings, earplugs and eye masks, relaxation therapy, sleep‐inducing music, massage, foot baths, aromatherapy, valerian acupressure, sound masking, and changing the visiting times of family members. We assessed the effects of these interventions on sleep outcomes (e.g., quality and amount of sleep), length of stay in the ICU, the occurrence of delirium, other adverse events, and death. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Overall, the quality of the evidence for an effect of the interventions on any of the outcomes was low or very low. Normally, we would try to pool findings from similar trials of each intervention, but this was difficult because the design of the trials varied greatly. We were able to combine the results from three trials of earplugs and eye masks and found that their use increased the number of hours slept and prevented delirium in adults in the ICU. However, we cannot be certain about these findings because of problems with how the trials were carried out.
