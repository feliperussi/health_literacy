High‐flow nasal cannulae for breathing support in adult intensive care patients
Review question 
Are high‐flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) a helpful treatment option for adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who need breathing support? 
Background 
People in the ICU may need support to breathe and HFNC are one option for this. HFNC deliver warm air and oxygen through small plastic tubes that sit inside the nostrils. The airflow is at a higher rate each minute than standard oxygen therapy (which is not always warmed and may be delivered through a plastic face mask or nasal cannulae). Other support options include non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) or non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). These approaches use mild pressure to push air into the lungs through tightly‐fitting face masks or a helmet covering the entire head. Invasive mechanical ventilation provides the highest level of support, using a ventilator (artificial breathing machine) to push air in and out of the lungs through a plastic tube inserted into the windpipe.

Study characteristics 
All participants were adults (16 years or older) requiring support to breathe in an ICU. Most participants had respiratory failure (in which the lungs are unable to get enough oxygen into the blood) or had just been taken off a ventilator and needed support to transition to independent breathing. 
We searched for randomized controlled trials; these trials give participants an equal chance to be in either trial group and provide the best evidence. We included trials that compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy or NIV or NIPPV. We included 31 studies with 5136 participants, 51 ongoing studies and 19 studies awaiting classification. Fourteen studies were funded by manufacturers of breathing equipment. 
Key results 
HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy 
We found that using HFNC may reduce the need for patients to change to another type of breathing support (treatment failure). We found no evidence of a difference between the two interventions for: hospital deaths, length of ICU stay, pneumonia (lung infection), skin damage caused by tubes or masks in contact with the face, comfort while patients received breathing support, or in how well either treatment provided oxygen to the blood. 
HFNC compared to NIV or NIPPV 
We found no evidence of a difference in treatment failure between using HFNC and NIV or NIPPV. We also found no evidence of a difference for hospital deaths, length of ICU stay, pneumonia, or barotrauma (damage to the body caused by differences in pressure inside and outside the body). NIV or NIPPV may improve how well oxygen gets into the blood. We are uncertain whether HFNC could be more comfortable for patients in the first 24 hours of use. No studies reported skin damage.
