Opiods for restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a very common neurological disorder in which patients complain of an intense need to move their legs, and unpleasant sensations felt deep in their legs, all occurring while at rest, mostly at bedtime. The number of patients complaining of RLS varies according to race, gender, age, country, and health status. About 5% to 10% of people are affected; , and, among these, 2% to 5% need continual pharmacological treatment (medication). When RLS does not respond to medications generally used for Parkinsons Disease and epilepsy, their doctors often prescribe opioids. 
Question 
Are opioids effective and safe for people with RLS?
Methods 
We searched the literature for studies in any language, published or not, that considered opioids for the treatment of RLS 
Results 
We included one randomised controlled clinical trial with moderate risk of bias that tested a combination of oxycodone and naloxone against placebo capsules, taken twice daily in participants whodid not respond to more usual medications. Researchers used the International RLS severity scale to find out if patients were improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom‐free. 
Discussion 
The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty‐four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events. 
Conclusion 
The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low‐quality evidence. Prescription of these medications should be based on clinical experience, and caution used due to the potential for abuse, dependency, and adverse events. No patient on opioids complained that their symptoms worsened.
