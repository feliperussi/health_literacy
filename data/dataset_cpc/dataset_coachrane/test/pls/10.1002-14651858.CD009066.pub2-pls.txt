Probiotics for preventing ventilator‐associated pneumonia
Review question 
To critically assess the current evidence from published studies relating to the effect of probiotics for preventing ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). 
Background 
VAP is a condition that can occur in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours and can significantly increase the likelihood of death within intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Despite the use of preventive measures and advances in antimicrobial therapy, VAP is the second most common hospital‐related infection in the USA. It is associated with an increased chance of disease and death, and increased healthcare costs. It is believed that probiotics can reinforce the gut barrier function, which may result in clinical benefits. However, until now, there has been no clear evidence to determine whether probiotics are associated with better clinical outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We identified eight studies with 1083 participants comparing probiotics versus placebo for preventing VAP. The studies were conducted between 2006 and 2011 in China, France, Greece, Slovenia, Sweden, the UK and the USA, with funding from various sources including hospital/National Health Service, pharmaceuticals and the National Institutes of Health. In the studies that stated the gender ratios, there were 611 males and 378 females. The evidence is current to September 2014. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
The results from these trials show that probiotics are associated with a reduction in instances of VAP. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of VAP increased the uncertainty in this finding. Results for all remaining reported outcomes (including mortality, incidence of diarrhoea, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and general antibiotic use) were uncertain between groups receiving either probiotics or placebo or standard treatment. Incidence of diarrhoea was reported in half of the included studies, which demonstrated no clear evidence of a difference between probiotics over standard care or placebo. The quality of the evidence was generally low to very low between studies. Due to the contradictions in the results from previously published systematic reviews and the uncertainty of these results, there is need for larger, well‐designed and robustly reported studies.
