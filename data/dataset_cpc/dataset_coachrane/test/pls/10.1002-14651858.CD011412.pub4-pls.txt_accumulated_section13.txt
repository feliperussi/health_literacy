Antiepileptic drug monotherapy (single drug treatment) for epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: focal seizures that start in one area of the brain, and generalised onset tonic‐clonic seizures that start in both cerebral hemispheres simultaneously. 
For around 70% of people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled and, for the majority, seizures are controlled with a single antiepileptic drug. Currently in the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as the first treatment options to try for individuals with newly diagnosed focal seizures and sodium valproate for individuals with newly diagnosed generalised tonic‐clonic seizures; however, a range of other antiepileptic drug treatments are available. 
The choice of the first antiepileptic drug for an individual with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance and should be made taking into account high‐quality evidence of how effective the drugs are at controlling seizures and whether they are associated with side effects. It is also important that drugs appropriate for different seizure types are compared to each other. 
Review methods 
The antiepileptic drugs of interest to this review were carbamazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, zonisamide, eslicarbazepine acetate, and lacosamide. In this review, we evaluated the evidence from 89 randomised controlled clinical trials comparing two or more of the drugs of interest based on how effective the drugs were at controlling seizures (i.e. whether people had recurrence of seizures or had long periods of freedom from seizures (remission)) and how tolerable any related side effects of the drugs were. We were able to combine data for 14,789 people from 39 of the 89 trials; for the remaining 7251 people from 50 trials, data were not available to use in this review. No data were available from people receiving eslicarbazepine acetate. 
We performed two types of analysis in this review; firstly, we combined data available where pairs of drugs had been compared directly in clinical trials and, secondly, we performed an analysis to combine all information from the clinical trials across the 'network' of 11 drugs. This analysis allowed us to compare drugs in the network that had not previously been compared to each other in clinical trials. 
Key results 
Our 'network' analysis showed that, for people with focal seizures and for people with generalised seizures, the oldest drugs (phenobarbitone and phenytoin) were better options in terms of seizure control than the other drugs but that these older drugs were the worst in terms of long‐term retention (stopping the treatment) compared to the newer drugs such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Sodium valproate was the best option of all the drugs for achieving control and remission of generalised tonic‐clonic seizures. 
The most commonly reported side effects across all drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, headache or migraine, gastrointestinal disturbances (stomach upsets), dizziness or faintness, and rash or skin disorders. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review provides high‐quality evidence for individuals with focal seizures and moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence for individuals with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures, as less information was available for some of the drugs of interest for people with this seizure type.
