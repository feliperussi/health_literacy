Treatment for speech disorder in Friedreich ataxia and other hereditary ataxia syndromes (inherited disorders of movement co‐ordination) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of treatment on speech difficulties in people with Friedreich ataxia and other hereditary ataxias. 
Background 
People with hereditary ataxia develop problems with co‐ordinating movement, which becomes worse over time. There are a range of other symptoms but this is the main feature of this group of diseases. Symptom onset is dependent on disease type and can begin in childhood or adulthood. Some types of hereditary ataxia appear later in life, even in middle age or older. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common of the young onset hereditary ataxias. 
Speech difficulties are a major feature of many of these disorders. People with ataxia often seek medical help because of slower speech, slurred speech or because the voice sounds harsh, or more nasal. Such difficulties can affect how well a person is able to communicate with friends, family and workmates. 
Study characteristics 
We searched widely for clinical trials and found 14 trials of treatments for speech problems in hereditary ataxias. The trials involved 721 participants. The duration of treatment was between two weeks and two years. Thirteen trials compared a medicine to a placebo and the 14th compared a mixed physiotherapy and occupational therapy treatment to no treatment. Ten different medicines were tested: L‐hydroxytryptophan (L‐5HT) (two studies), thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) (two studies), varenicline, riluzole, idebenone (two studies), betamethasone, coenzyme Q10 with vitamin E, buspirone, ɑ‐tocopheryl quinone and erythropoietin. We did not find any studies of traditional speech therapies. There were three ongoing trials.
