Prevention of blood clots in non‐hospitalised cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
Background 
Cancer patients are more likely than people without cancer to develop venous thromboembolism (blood clots in the veins). Chemotherapy may activate blood coagulation (clotting) and further increase this risk. Anticoagulants are medicines which are used to prevent and treat blood clots. They are sometimes known as blood thinners. This systematic review aimed to look at the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants and mechanical interventions when used to prevent blood clots in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Key results 
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 15,678 participants (current search to August 2020). All studies evaluated anticoagulants and were performed mainly in people with locally advanced (unlikely to be cured) or metastatic (where the cancer has spread from the part of the body where it started) cancer. Direct oral anticoagulants (anticoagulants that act by directly binding to and inhibiting specific coagulation factors – thrombin or activated factor X) may reduce the occurrence of blood clots and probably increase the risk of major bleeding in people with cancer. Low‐molecular‐weight heparins (anticoagulants that increase the activity of the natural anticoagulant antithrombin) were associated with a reduction in symptomatic blood clots, but increased the risk of major bleeding. In people with the blood‐related cancer, multiple myeloma, low‐molecular‐weight heparin reduced the number of symptomatic blood clots when compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, while the difference with aspirin was not clear; there were no major bleeds with low‐molecular‐weight heparin or warfarin, and in participants treated with aspirin the rate was below 1%. One study evaluated unfractionated heparin and did not report on blood clots or major bleeding. Data for warfarin in comparison with placebo (pretend treatment) were too limited to support the use of warfarin in the prevention of symptomatic blood clots in cancer patients. One study in children evaluated antithrombin, which had no significant effect on any type of blood clots or major bleeding when compared with no antithrombin. 
Quality of the evidence 
The methodological quality of the included studies ranged from low to high, such that future studies may change our confidence in the results, in particular with regard to the safety of anticoagulants. The reliability of the findings ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors, which were the reason for a decrease in reliability in some outcomes, were imprecision and risk of bias. The relatively low number of studies, participants, and clinical events prevented us from providing more definitive conclusions about the risk of bleeding in association with anticoagulants. None of the studies tested intermittent pneumatic compression (a mechanical device using an air pump and inflatable leggings to provide pulsing pressure that pushes blood through the veins) or graduated elastic stockings (special socks that improve blood flow in the leg veins and prevent blood from pooling in the legs) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.
