Comparing two types of blood‐thinning drugs, factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists, to prevent blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation 
Review question 
We compared the benefits and harms of two types of so‐called "blood‐thinning" drugs (factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists) in people with atrial fibrillation. 
Background 
People with atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes the heart to beat irregularly, are at an increased risk of getting blood clots. Such clots can block blood vessels and cause severe organ damage in the brain (stroke) or other organs. Various guidelines recommend that people with atrial fibrillation should be treated with "blood‐thinning" drugs such as factor Xa inhibitors or vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) because these drugs can prevent the formation of blood clots. Serious side effects of these drugs are bleedings (e.g. into the brain) that can cause serious disability or even death. 
Study characteristics 
We searched various sources up to 29 August 2017 and included 13 studies that involved 67,688 people with atrial fibrillation who received either a factor Xa inhibitor or a vitamin K antagonist. All included people were adults and on average aged between 65 and 74 years. Approximately one‐third were women. 
Key results 
We found that factor Xa inhibitors when compared with warfarin, which was used as comparator in all trials, reduced the number of strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. This reduction was, however, rather small. Factor Xa inhibitors also appeared to reduce the number of serious bleedings (including those into the brain) and the number of people dying from any cause compared with warfarin.
