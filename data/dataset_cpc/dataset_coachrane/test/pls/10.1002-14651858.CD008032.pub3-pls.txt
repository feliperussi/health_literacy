Short‐course versus long‐course intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community‐acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months 
Review question 
We conducted this review to determine if there are any differences in treatment outcomes between short‐ (two to three days) and long‐course (five days) intravenous antibiotics (alone or combined with oral antibiotics) for children aged two months to 59 months with severe pneumonia. 
Background 
Pneumonia is infection of the lungs (often caused by a virus or bacteria) that causes about 1.3 million deaths each year in children under five years of age. There are about 120 million new cases of pneumonia among children under five years of age globally each year, of which about 14 million become severe pneumonia. A significant proportion of these new cases of pneumonia occur among children in low‐income countries. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends five days of intravenous antibiotic treatment for children with severe pneumonia. Treatment in hospital for children with severe pneumonia places significant burden on children and their families, including substantial expense, loss of routine, and decreased quality of life. Reducing time spent in hospital for treatment could potentially reduce the burden of disease and may lead to better treatment compliance. 
Search date 
We conducted our last search in 22 December 2016, and identified no studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We did not find any relevant studies to include in this review. Physicians should continue to treat children with severe pneumonia according to the WHO recommendations until further evidence becomes available.
