Treadmill interventions in children under six years of age at risk of delay in motor skills 
Review question 
This is an update of the review published in 2011, which examined the effect of treadmill interventions on children below six years of age at risk of delay in motor skills. 
Background 
Helping children with motor delays to walk is often the focus of therapeutic intervention. Some literature suggests that treadmill training could provide an opportunity for children to walk with support for sufficient periods of time to enhance motor learning. This review examined existing evidence about treadmill interventions in young children with neuromotor impairment. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to May 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included seven studies on treadmill intervention on 175 children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, general developmental delay or children with moderate risk for delay. Studies used home‐based or clinic‐based treadmill protocols, ranging in duration from six weeks to several months, or until the children walked independently. 
Treadmill training versus no treadmill training was compared in five studies, including 117 children with one of the above mentioned risks. Treadmill training with or without orthotics (braces) was examined in 22 children with Down syndrome. High‐intensity versus low‐intensity treadmill training was compared in 36 children with Down syndrome. 
Key results 
Compared to no treadmill intervention, treadmill training helped 30 children with Down syndrome to walk earlier, but did not help 28 infants at moderate risk for developmental delay. 
Overall, treadmill intervention did not improve overall gross motor function or gross motor skills related to standing. One study, which compared treadmill intervention with and without orthotics in 17 children with Down syndrome, suggested that adding orthotics might hinder gross motor progress. However, 20 ambulatory children with developmental delay, who engaged in treadmill training at preschool, improved walking skills. Twelve children with cerebral palsy, who received intensive treadmill training, showed faster achievement of motor milestones than children without treadmill training. 
None of the studies reported problems or injuries from the treadmill training.
Overall, support for the intervention is limited. Confirmation from larger studies is necessary. Once efficacy of the intervention is established, optimal dosage research is needed. 
Use of statistics 
Statistical analysis was only performed on similar outcomes across studies.
Quality of the evidence 
Standardized assessment for quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Quality of evidence was determined by the number of children studied, completeness of the data, and random group assignment.
