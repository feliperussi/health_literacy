Methotrexate alone or in combination with other medications for rheumatoid arthritis
Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of methotrexate either taken alone or with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with rheumatoid arthritis. After searching for all relevant studies up to January 19, 2016, they found 158 studies with over 37,000 people. These studies were published between 1985 and 2016 and were between 12 weeks and 2 years in duration. Their findings are summarised below: 
In people with rheumatoid arthritis, compared to taking methotrexate alone:
‐The combination of methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate + most biologic DMARDs improves disease activity. Other treatment combinations (methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate + leflunomide, methotrexate + gold injections) may improve disease activity in people who do not respond to methotrexate alone. 
‐The combinations of methotrexate + several biologic DMARDs (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab) reduces joint damage (as seen on x‐rays) slightly over one year in patients who have not taken methotrexate before. 
‐The combinations of methotrexate + azathioprine, methotrexate + cyclosporine and methotrexate + tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) probably increases the chance of stopping the medication due to a side effect. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is methotrexate and other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs? 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. There is no cure for RA at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. Fortunately, there are many medications that can control the disease effectively. These medications are known as disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs. Methotrexate is widely regarded as the preferred DMARD for most patients with RA as it works well for most patients and is generally well tolerated. Methotrexate can be used by itself or can be combined with other DMARDs. These other DMARDs include medications that have been available and used for many years (such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine), as well as newer more expensive treatments (biologic DMARDs and tofacitinib). It is important to understand how all of these treatments compare in terms of the benefits and side effects. 
What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate combined with other disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs? 
A) People who have not taken methotrexate before: 
ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)
‐61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 56 to 67 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 41 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone. 
X‐rays of the joints:
‐People who took methotrexate combined with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, or infliximab had a small reduction in the progression of joint damage (Sharp‐van der Heijde score) over one year compared to oral methotrexate, but the estimated amount of damage even with oral methotrexate was very small (2.6 point increase). 
Stopping the medication due to a side effect
‐36 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + azathioprine had to stop the medication due to a side effect, compared to 8 people out of 100 who took methotrexate alone. 
B) People who have taken methotrexate before: 
ACR 50 (number of tender or swollen joints and other outcomes such as pain and disability)
‐61 out of 100 people who took methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine and 27 to 64 people out of 100 who took methotrexate + biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib experienced improvement in the symptoms of their rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 13 out of 100 people who took methotrexate alone.
