Comparison of animal‐derived surfactants for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants 
Review question: Does the use of one animal‐derived surfactant preparation compared with an alternative animal‐derived surfactant preparation lead to improved outcome in infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome? 
Background: A wide variety of surfactant preparations are used to prevent or treat respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. All commercially available animal‐derived surfactant products are effective for prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. However, it is unclear whether significant differences in clinical outcome exist among the available animal‐derived surfactant extracts. This review compared different animal‐derived surfactant products based on their source (bovine vs. porcine) and method of extraction (minced lung vs. lung lavage). 
Study characteristics: 16 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. 
Results: We found improvement in risk of death before hospital discharge and the risk of combined outcome of death or oxygen requirement at four weeks before due date of birth with the use of higher dose of porcine surfactant (a surfactant product derived from pig's lung) compared with a minced bovine surfactant (surfactant obtained from minced cow's lung). Based on the available evidence, we cannot state with certainty whether the improvement in outcome with high dose porcine‐derived surfactant is from dose effect (higher phospholipid levels with use of higher initial dose) or from the effect of source of surfactant extraction (pig vs. cow). Comparison trials of surfactants obtained from bovine sources that used different extraction methods or modifications showed no difference in clinical outcomes.
