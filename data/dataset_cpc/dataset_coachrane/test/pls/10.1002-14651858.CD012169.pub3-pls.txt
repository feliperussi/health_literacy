Anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet drugs, or both, for reducing the risk of blood clots and stroke in people with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out which type of treatment works best for preventing stroke and other blood clotting (thrombotic) events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). 
Background 
APS is a disease where the immune system produces antibodies against the person's own cells. The presence of such antibodies increases the risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) in blood vessels (veins or arteries, or both) and can cause pregnancy‐related complications such as miscarriage. Blood clots in arteries can cause strokes. Two types of drugs are commonly used to prevent blood clots in people with APS: anticoagulants such as warfarin (which interfere with proteins that form blood clots) and antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin (which prevent cells called platelets from sticking together). 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 22 November 2019. We looked for studies that randomly allocated people with APS to different treatments, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, or both. We identified eight studies involving 811 participants, with the average age between 36 and 50 years. Three studies compared rivaroxaban (a new oral anticoagulant) with standard‐dose warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist – VKA). Two studies compared two intensities of VKA anticoagulation: high versus standard. One study compared standard‐dose VKA plus aspirin versus standard‐dose VKA alone. The remaining studies compared different combinations of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin). One study compared dual antiplatelet drugs versus single antiplatelet drugs. Interventions lasted from 180 days to a median of 58.4 months. 
Key results 
In three studies comparing rivaroxaban (NOAC) with standard‐dose VKA there were similar proportions of participants with blood clots, bleeding, or death (moderate‐certainty evidence), but there were more participants with stroke in the NOAC group than in the VKA group (moderate‐certainty evidence). In the two studies comparing high‐dose versus a standard‐dose VKA, similar proportions of participants had blood clotting and major bleeding problems (low‐certainty evidence), but participants in the high‐dose group had a greater risk of minor and any bleeding problems (low‐certainty evidence). A study comparing standard VKA plus an antiplatelet drug with standard‐dose VKA observed more participants with any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (low‐certainty evidence) and similar proportions of participants for other outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). 
The remaining studies comparing different combinations of antiplatelet drug and/or VKA were inconclusive regarding benefits or harms (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). 
We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification.
Certainty of the evidence 
Most of the results were imprecise and did not clearly indicate benefit or harm.
