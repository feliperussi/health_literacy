Training healthcare providers to respond to intimate partner violence against women
Review question 
Does intimate partner violence (IPV) training for healthcare providers (HCPs) improve their: 
· attitudes or beliefs, or both, towards IPV,· readiness to respond to those affected by IPV,· knowledge of IPV,· referral of women being subjected to IPV to specialist services,· actual response to women subjected to IPV (such as validation or safety planning),· identification and documentation of IPV, and· the mental health of survivors of IPV? 
Background 
Intimate partner violence is associated with a wide range of short‐ and long‐term physical and mental health problems. These include injuries and death, depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder, unplanned/unwanted pregnancies and gynaecological problems, to name a few. Health problems can last beyond the duration of the violence and women who have experienced violence are more likely to seek health care compared to women who have never experienced violence. 
Women are more likely to trust HCPs with a disclosure of violence. For some women, a healthcare setting may be one of the few places women can attend on their own. HCPs (such as nurses, doctors, midwives, etc.) are therefore ideally situated to identify and provide support for women affected by IPV. Many healthcare settings provide clinical guidelines or training or both on how to identify and respond to IPV. We wanted to find out what difference training makes to IPV‐related HCP attitudes, knowledge and response, including the care provided to women affected by IPV and whether it improved their health outcomes, including their mental health, or made a difference to their exposure to IPV. 
Study characteristics 
We found 19 trials comparing IPV training to no training, training as usual, or other trainings that were included in this review, with 1662 participants who were practising or student/trainee doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, social workers and psychologists/counsellors. Three‐quarters of all studies were conducted in the USA, with single studies from Australia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey and the Netherlands. Most studies received some university or government financial support to complete the research. 
Studies varied greatly in the kind of IPV training provided, in both content and delivery method. Studies differed in how they measured training outcomes and follow‐up time points. Most IPV training included types and definitions of IPV, prevalence and risk factors, and sought to challenge common myths and misinformation. Clinical scenarios were frequently used as learning tools, outlining typical patient presentations, and skills training involved learning how to ask women about IPV, how to respond by validating their experiences, document accurately, discuss safety planning and refer women to support services. 
Key results with an assessment of the certainty of the evidence 
Compared to no training, placebo or wait‐list, IPV training may have positive effects on HCPs' attitudes towards survivors of IPV. Training may improve their knowledge around, and readiness to respond to survivors of IPV, but the evidence is very uncertain. There is limited evidence that some types of IPV training can lead to improvements in identification, safety planning and documentation of IPV, but the findings are inconsistent, and most studies report little to no impact of training on these outcomes. Training may make little to no difference to referral practices. No studies with no training, placebo or wait‐list in the comparison group, assessed IPV survivors' mental health outcomes. No adverse effects of IPV training were reported in any of these studies. 
The studies that compared training of HCPs to training as usual or a sub‐component of the training typically found no difference in HCPs' attitudes, safety planning, and referral to services or mental health outcomes for women. The evidence was inconsistent about provider readiness to respond, their actual response and changes in IPV knowledge. 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence for the effectiveness of training HCPs in how to respond to IPV is low to very low. Future research should include higher‐quality trials, with greater clarity of methods that objectively measure outcomes (actual rather than perceived), with an emphasis on behaviour change in HCPs, and the well‐being of women survivors of IPV. 
Up‐to‐dateness of the review
