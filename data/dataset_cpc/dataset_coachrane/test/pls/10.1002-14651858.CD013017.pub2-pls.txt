Psychological therapies for women who experience intimate partner violence
The review question 
Domestic violence (physical, emotional, sexual abuse and controlling behaviour by a partner or ex‐partner) is common worldwide and causes long‐lasting emotional and physical health problems. Psychological therapies (counselling by trained people) may improve women's mental health and enable them to focus on making safety plans, accessing resources for themselves and their children, and ultimately to escape the domestic violence. 
We searched scientific literature worldwide up to the end of October 2019 for trials comparing a group of female domestic violence survivors who received psychological therapy with those who did not, to understand whether such therapies are safe and effective. 
Trial characteristics 
Women had been randomly placed in one group (the intervention) or the other (comparison). We found 33 trials involving 5517 women, with an average age of 37 years, and two‐thirds of them were unemployed. Half of them were married or living with a partner, and for half of them the domestic violence was in the last 12 months. Psychological therapies were mostly delivered face‐to‐face but varied by the length of treatment (2 to 50 sessions) and the staff who delivered the therapies (social workers, nurses, psychologists, community health workers, family doctors, researchers). Women were invited from healthcare settings, community centres and domestic violence refuges and shelters. Nineteen trials measured women's depression, two assessed self‐efficacy (if women believed they were capable of making changes in their lives) and all measured dropout from the groups. We used the number of dropouts to measure harmful effects. Most trials followed up on the women within six months of starting the trial. 
Key results 
We found evidence that psychological therapies probably reduce depression and may reduce anxiety symptoms for women who have experienced domestic violence (six to 12 months after the therapy). Psychological therapies do not appear to cause any harm. However, we are uncertain whether psychological therapies improve self‐efficacy, mental health, quality of life, social support, uptake of healthcare and domestic violence services, safety planning or reduce post‐traumatic stress disorder and re‐exposure to any form of domestic violence. 
Overall, there is a need for more trials with consistent outcomes at similar follow‐up time points as we were unable to combine much of the research to give an overall picture. Thus, while women experiencing domestic violence may be helped by psychological therapies to improve their emotional health, which may in turn help their ongoing needs of safety, support and holistic healing from complex trauma, we are uncertain whether psychological therapies improve these aspects of their lives.
