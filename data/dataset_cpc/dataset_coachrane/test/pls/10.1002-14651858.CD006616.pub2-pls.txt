Intravenous N‐acetylcysteine compared to placebo for treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis in seriously ill adults 
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a complex response to an insult such as major surgery or trauma. It is called sepsis syndrome, or simply sepsis, when infection is present. The generalized inflammatory reaction involves activation of leukocytes and endothelial cells and the release of inflammatory mediators and toxic oxygen free radicals. Diffuse microthrombosis can result in localized tissue perfusion abnormalities and low oxygenation (hypoxia). Both SIRS and sepsis can be difficult to treat and are major causes of multiple organ failure and the death of patients in the intensive care unit. SIRS and sepsis both lead to a drop in the level of antioxidants normally present in the body. 
N‐acetylcysteine is an antioxidant with strong anti‐inflammatory effects that is used in treating endotoxaemia and overdoses of acetaminophen. This Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials with 2768 critically ill adult patients found no evidence to support the theory that N‐acetylcysteine might reduce the risk of death in adults with SIRS or sepsis. Intravenous N‐acetylcysteine did not affect the length of stay in the intensive care unit, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of support for the cardiovascular system or incidence of new organ failure. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of N‐acetylcysteine in SIRS or sepsis. We also found that when N‐acetylcysteine was administered more than 24 hours after the development of clinical signs of SIRS or sepsis it may even be harmful, by causing cardiovascular depression. 
Twenty of the trials used N‐acetylcysteine in patients around the time of surgery, including cardiac, vascular and major abdominal surgery, and liver transplantation. Eight studies evaluated N‐acetylcysteine in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock associated with the medical conditions acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, liver failure, malaria or burns. The dosing of N‐acetylcysteine, timing and duration of treatment, from a single intravenous dose to infusions up to seven days, varied. Twenty papers had a low risk of bias.
