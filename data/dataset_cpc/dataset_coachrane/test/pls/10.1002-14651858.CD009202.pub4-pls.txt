Propofol versus thiopental sodium for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) 
Review question: In this review we evaluated the evidence for the use of these anaesthetic drugs in controlling seizure activity in patients with RSE. 
Background: Persistent convulsions (lasting 30 minutes or more) are a major medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. At times, these convulsions fail to respond to first‐ and second‐line drug therapy, and may occur in up to 31% of patients suffering from persistent seizure or convulsive activities. Persistent seizure activity may become unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs. Anaesthetics such as thiopental sodium and propofol are frequently given for control of seizures in such situations. Both agents have their own side effects and complications. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to August 2016. We could only identify one trial, which was terminated early due to recruitment problems. This study enrolled only 24 participants of the required 150. This study was a small, single‐blind, multicentre trial studying adults with RSE receiving either propofol or thiopental sodium for the control of seizure activity. 
Key results: There was no difference between the two drugs in their ability to control seizure activity. The only difference noted was the requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation for patients in the thiopental sodium group. This could be due to the prolonged presence of the drug in the body due to its slow removal. 
Quality of evidence: We judged the quality of the evidence for our primary outcomes of total control of seizures and in‐hospital mortality to be low. There is a clear need for a large randomised controlled trial to study the efficacy of anaesthetic agents in the treatment of RSE.
