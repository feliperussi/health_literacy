Flupenthixol compared with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics
Flupenthixol was first made available in the UK in 1965 and it has been used to treat schizophrenia for nearly five decades. It is available both as a tablet and a long‐acting injection. Having been investigated in numerous studies, flupenthixol was found to be effective and well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The main side effects are shaking, restlessness or the inability to sit still, a dry mouth and some weight gain. Although this drug has been available for decades, few systematic reviews exist on flupenthixol. The effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently measured, quantified and known. The review could include only one small study, which was limited and 13 years old. The number as well as the quality of the study was low; for the main outcomes of interest the authors could not rate the quality of evidence at all, as the study did not report on the outcomes of interest for the 'Summary of findings' table. Flupenthixol was compared with chlorpromazine. There was no clear difference in efficacy, nor was there clear information on: increasing their use of services; people’s satisfaction with treatment; quality of life; or costs and cost effectiveness. Flupenthixol is widely available and inexpensive. It is perhaps understandable that it remains one of many drugs used for treating people with serious mental illnesses. This is because the use of flupenthixol is based more on clinical experience, and the decisions of psychiatrists are based on large scale research studies and evidence‐based information. The effectiveness and benefits of flupenthixol over chlorpromazine remain largely unknown and incomplete. Large randomised trials could be helpful in increasing knowledge about this drug.
