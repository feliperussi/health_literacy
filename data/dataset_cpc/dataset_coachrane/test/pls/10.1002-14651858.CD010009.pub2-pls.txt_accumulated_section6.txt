Topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents for diabetic cystoid macular oedema
Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs for diabetic cystoid macular oedema. 
Background Diabetic retinopathy is a frequent cause of blindness in adults aged between 20 and 74 years. The major cause of vision impairment in those with diabetic retinopathy is the accumulation of fluid in the central part of the retina (macula) known as cystoid macular oedema (CMO). CMO is the chronic and diffuse variety of diabetic macular oedema (DMO).The use of topical anti‐inflammatory agents has been suggested as a potential treatment for diabetic CMO. 
We aimed to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (these are clinical research studies, which give good quality evidence on the effects of interventions) that investigated the effects of various topically applied non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in treating diabetic CMO, and evaluate whether significant benefits have occurred with topical NSAIDs. 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of locally applied NSAID eye preparations on restoring vision in people with diabetic CMO. Although various topical NSAIDs have been used to treat diabetic CMO, namely bromfenac 0.09%, nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5%, we did not find any RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that were eligible for this review. We also found that most of the studies identified through the electronic searches had been conducted to analyse the effect of topical NSAIDs for pseudophakic CMO. 
Greater research is required to understand the effects of topical NSAIDs on diabetic CMO. We would recommend a RCT to assess the effects of topical NSAIDs in patients with diabetic CMO. The trial would need to have a follow‐up of at least one year, and include a large sample size and a robust design in order to assess any potential long‐term beneficial or adverse effects of locally applied NSAIDs.
