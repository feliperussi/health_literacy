Pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disability
Background 
Epilepsy is a common condition. Approximately 3% of the general population are diagnosed with epilepsy at some point in their life (Rugg‐Gunn 2012). However, epilepsy is significantly more common in people with intellectual disabilities where estimates range from 14% to 44% (Bowley 2000). People with intellectual disability and epilepsy often do not respond as well to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as the general population and behavioural disturbances are frequent. We review the use of AEDs in this population. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 2 September 2014. The included studies assessed the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In total we included 14 studies and data from 1116 participants in the present review update. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, seven studies had insufficient information regarding how the trial was funded and one study was free from other bias. 
Key results 
This updated review confirms that in the majority of cases where intellectually disabled populations participated in trials of AEDs, moderate reductions in seizure frequency and occasional seizure freedom were obtained. The present update found that participants in the AED groups were more likely to report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with the control groups. The results also suggested that participants in the AED group were more likely to become seizure‐free and report a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared with participants in the placebo group, however these results were not significant. Additionally, the results of the present update suggest that more participants in the AED groups withdrew from treatment and reported adverse effects compared with the placebo group, however these results were also not significant. Where adverse events were reported they appeared to be similar to those seen in people without intellectual disability and thus they were not specific to this population.
