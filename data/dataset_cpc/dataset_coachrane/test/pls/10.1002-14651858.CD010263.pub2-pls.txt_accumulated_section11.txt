Techniques for reducing pain during orthodontics without using painkillers
Review question 
Orthodontic treatment (teeth braces) can be painful, particularly following initial brace placement and later adjustments, for a week or more. We examined the merits of methods to reduce pain during orthodontic treatment without the need for painkillers. 
Background 
Pain is usual during orthodontic treatment and may make some people stop treatment early, meaning that planned benefits do not occur. Painkillers are recommended to reduce pain during orthodontic treatment, but an effective non‐drug solution would lower risks of side effects and help people to continue for the full course of treatment. 
Search date 
We included studies published before 6 October 2016.
Study characteristics 
We included 14 studies that involved a total of 931 teenagers and adults. The studies investigated the effects of using laser irradiation provided by the orthodontist, vibratory devices, changing chewing patterns (patients chewing gum or wafers), brain wave music, cognitive behavioural therapy, and text messages to support people after braces were fitted. The main outcome measured was the intensity of pain over the short term as reported by patients. 
Key results 
We found insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of the interventions, although the available low‐quality evidence suggested that laser irradiation may help to control short‐term orthodontic pain. None of the studies considered side effects of the treatments. We identified relatively few studies, some of which used flawed methods or were not well reported. More research to look at the possible merits of non‐drug methods of pain control would be helpful. Future studies should measure pain over longer time periods and should measure side effects and costs.
