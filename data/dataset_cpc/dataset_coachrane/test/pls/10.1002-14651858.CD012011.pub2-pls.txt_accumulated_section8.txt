Use of reflective materials during phototherapy for infants with jaundice
Review question: We wanted to find out whether use of curtains made from reflective materials hung from the side of phototherapy units improves the effectiveness of phototherapy. 
Background: Jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin) occurs in up to 60% of babies. This is due to accumulation of bilirubin. Mild elevations in bilirubin are considered normal, but when levels are very high, bilirubin could enter the brain and cause brain damage. Treatment using age‐ and risk‐specific guidelines is aimed at preventing bilirubin from reaching these levels. Phototherapy (exposing the body to light of a specific wavelength) is the usual treatment, and the intensity of light on the skin is one of the factors determining the rate of decline in bilirubin. A potentially inexpensive method to increase the intensity of light is to use reflective materials. One of the concerns is that these curtains might obscure the view of the baby. 
Study characteristics: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The search is up‐to‐date as of the first of November 2019. 
Key results: We found 12 studies with a total of 1288 babies. Of these, 11 compared a single unit of light with or without reflective materials around the lights. One trial compared a single unit of light and reflective materials with two units of light without curtains. Types of reflective materials included white plastic, white linen, and aluminium draped on three or four sides of the baby's cot. 
We found sufficient data on the primary outcome ‐ decline in bilirubin ‐ in 11 studies including 1132 babies: 10 for the first comparison and one for the second comparison. 
Three studies reported a decline in bilirubin at four to eight hours. Moderate‐certainty evidence shows a small but clinically important difference favouring the use of curtains. Decline in bilirubin over 24 hours was measured in nine studies. All studies showed a faster decline in bilirubin in the curtains group, but the decline varied so widely that it was not meaningful to estimate the size of the effect. Four studies reporting the duration of phototherapy showed that it was shorter when reflective curtains were used, but this is of very low certainty. Moderate‐certainty evidence from two studies shows that the intervention reduces hospital stay by almost two days. There were no reports of any important adverse events, such as temperature instability or acute life‐threatening events due to curtains obscuring the baby, nor of other minor effects. This means that overall reflective curtains might provide benefit, but we are uncertain about whether there are any harms. None of the studies reported parent or healthcare personnel satisfaction with the curtains, or whether the curtains had any effect on breastfeeding rates. 
One trial compared use of one light unit with curtains to use of two light units without curtains and showed similar results for both intervention and control groups.
