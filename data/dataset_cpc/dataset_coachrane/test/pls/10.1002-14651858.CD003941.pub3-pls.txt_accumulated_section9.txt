Do strategies to remind people to have vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations? 
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to determine whether strategies to remind people to receive vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Key messages 
Reminding people to receive their vaccinations increases vaccination rates across different populations. 
What was studied 
Vaccinations are used to prevent a number of diseases but there is wide variation in vaccination coverage across different regions and countries. This can lead to diseases that are otherwise preventable by vaccines, having a large effect on individuals and communities. Informing people of an upcoming vaccination or telling them that they have missed a vaccination might help to increase coverage and reduce the effect and impact of disease preventable by vaccine. We reviewed 75 studies to evaluate whether reminding people to get vaccinated worked. The studies we looked at were from different settings, such as rural areas, schools, private practices, and state health departments. Most studies were done in the USA. The studies included a range of different groups: infants and children, adolescents and adults requiring routine vaccination, as well as adults who required the influenza vaccine. In most of the studies reminders took the form of person to person telephone calls, automated calls, letters or postcards. In few recent studies text messaging was used. 
Main results of the review 
Our review found that reminding people to have vaccinations likely increases the number of people who receive vaccinations by an average of 8 percentage points, although there was variation in the results of the studies. Reminding people by telephone and autodialer calls, sending a letter or postcard, or sending a text message increased vaccinations. Combinations of reminders were also effective. Reminding people over the telephone was more effective than the other types of reminders. The increases in vaccinations were observed among children, adolescents, and adults.
