Semen preparation techniques for intrauterine insemination
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of three different sperm preparation techniques (gradient, swim‐up, and wash technique) on clinical outcome after intrauterine insemination (IUI). 
Background 
Semen preparation techniques are used in assisted reproduction to separate sperm which have a normal appearance and move spontaneously from the fluid portion of the semen in which the sperm are suspended. The effectiveness of specific semen preparation techniques for increasing pregnancy rates in subfertile couples undergoing IUI is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
We found six randomised controlled trials comparing a gradient, swim‐up or wash technique, in a total of 485 couples undergoing IUI. The evidence is current to March 2019. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether there is a difference in pregnancy outcomes between the three sperm preparation techniques for subfertile couples undergoing IUI. No studies reported on live birth rates. 
Swim‐up versus gradient technique 
Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there was a difference between clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) for swim‐up versus a gradient technique. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim‐up technique is between 14% and 30%. We are uncertain whether there was a difference between ongoing pregnancy rates per couple, multiple pregnancy rates (MPR) per couple or miscarriage rates (MR) per couple when comparing a swim‐up versus gradient technique. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was very low. No studies reported on ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. 
Swim‐up versus wash technique 
Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a swim‐up technique versus wash and centrifugation. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 38%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim‐up technique is between 9% and 41%. Considering the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates between swim‐up technique versus wash technique. Miscarriage rate was only reported by one study: no miscarriages were reported in either treatment arm. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. 
Gradient versus wash technique 
Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 13%, the chance of pregnancy after using the gradient technique is between 8% and 46%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates per couple between the treatment groups. Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates per couple between the treatment groups. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate.
