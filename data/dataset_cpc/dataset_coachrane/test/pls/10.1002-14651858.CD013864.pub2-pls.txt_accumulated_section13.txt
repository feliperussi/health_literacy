Antibiotics for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in newborns and children
Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia.

Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin.
