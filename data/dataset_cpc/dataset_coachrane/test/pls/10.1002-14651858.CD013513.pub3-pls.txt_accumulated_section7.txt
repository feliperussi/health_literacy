Biologics for people with chronic rhinosinusitis
What is the aim of this review? 
'Biologics' is the name given to a type of drug that is increasingly being used to help people with diseases due to inflammation of body tissues. The aim of this review is to see if any of these drugs are effective in treating people with chronic rhinosinusitis. These patients have long‐term problems with inflammation of the nose and sinuses. This leads to them having blocked, stuffy, runny noses and pain in their cheeks. They often need to use long‐term steroid nasal sprays. Some patients with chronic rhinosinusitis also get polyps in their nose. These can make their symptoms worse. 
Key message 
One of the new biologics – called dupilumab – helps people with severe chronic rhinosinusitis who also have nasal polyps and are already taking a nasal steroid spray. It makes their symptoms better and does not seem to cause any severe side effects. Another similar drug – called mepolizumab – may do the same but we are less certain about that. A third drug ‐ omalizumab ‐ also seems to improve the symptoms of people who have severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
What was studied in the review? 
We looked for trials where patients with chronic rhinosinusitis had been given either one of the new biologic drugs or a placebo (dummy) treatment. They needed to have been treated for at least three months. We looked for studies that measured the effect of the drug on people's symptoms, their general health and any adverse effects.
