Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‚Äêfree survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small.
