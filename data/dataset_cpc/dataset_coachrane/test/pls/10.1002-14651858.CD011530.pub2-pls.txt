Antibiotics for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections in children at high risk aged 12 years and under 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for antibiotics to prevent bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children aged 12 years and under who are at increased chance of contracting such infections. 
Background 
Annually, about 1.4 million children die from respiratory tract infections. One in five of these deaths occur in children under five years old. Using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under may be beneficial. However, no review currently describes the evidence for using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in this population. 
Study characteristics 
In February 2015, we searched for studies examining the effect of antibiotics to prevent LRTI in children aged 12 years and under with an increased risk of contracting such infections. 
We included 10 studies; three examined the effectiveness of antibiotics in 1345 children with HIV, four in 429 children with cystic fibrosis, one in 219 children with sickle cell disease, one in 160 children undergoing treatment for cancer, and one in 40 children who were underweight at birth with underlying breathing problems. 
The study duration was between 18.9 and 24.7 months for children with HIV, between six and 36 months in children with cystic fibrosis, 15 months in one study of children with sickle cell disease, 13 to 24 months in one study of children with cancer, and seven days in low birth weight newborns with underlying respiratory problems. 
Study funding sources 
Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity. 
Of four studies that included children with cystic fibrosis, three were funded by charities and one by government. 
The one study that included children with sickle cell disease was funded by government and the study that included children with cancer was funded by government, industry and charity. 
The funding source for the study that included newborns with underlying respiratory disorders was not specified. 
Key results 
In children with HIV, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis. Overall there was no improvement in death rates, but there was a marked reduction in hospital admission with antibiotic use in one study. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of infection with Pseudomonas bacteria, but there was a reduction in flare‐ups, where bacterial infection makes it harder for the child to breathe. 
In one study of children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting blood infections. 
In one study of children with cancers, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting Pneumocystis infection in the lungs. 
In low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of lung infections. 
Quality of the evidence 
In children with HIV, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics for preventing tuberculosis as moderate because of differences in how the antibiotics were administered. We rated the quality of the evidence for antibiotic use in reducing deaths as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for hospital admissions. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pseudomonas infection as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. We rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing 'flare‐ups' as high. 
In children with cancer, we rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pneumocystis infection as moderate because of the likelihood of indirectness of the study results. 
Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of blood infections in children with sickle cell disease, or in reducing the likelihood of lung infections in low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders; the two studies had low probability and high probability of bias respectively.
