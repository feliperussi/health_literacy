Social norms interventions are not effective enough on their own to reduce alcohol use or misuse among university or college students 
Background: Drinking is influenced by youth perceptions of how their peers drink. These perceptions are often incorrect, overestimating peer drinking norms. If inaccurate perceptions can be corrected, with social norms information or feedback, young people may drink less. 
Search date: To July 2015. 
Study characteristics: 70 studies were included in this review, with 44,958 students overall. We were interested mainly in studies with a follow‐up period of four or more months to assess whether any effects were sustained beyond the immediate short term. In 43 of the trials, the social norms intervention was targeted at higher‐risk students. 55 trials were conducted in the USA, with others form Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
Delivery of social norms information included mailed feedback, web/computer feedback, individual face‐to‐face feedback, group face‐to‐face feedback and general social norms marketing campaigns across college campuses. 
Key findings 
Over the longer‐term, after four or more months of follow‐up, there was only a small effect of social norms information on binge drinking, drinking quantity, and peak BAC. For these outcomes, effects were not any different across the different delivery modes.Only small effects were found for web feedback and individual face‐to‐face feedback on frequency of alcohol consumed. Only a small effect of individual face‐to‐face feedback on alcohol related problems, but no effects were found for mailed or web feedback. Similarly, no effects were found for group face‐to‐face feedback or for marketing campaigns on frequency of alcohol consumed and typical BAC. 
Our reading of these results is that, although we found some significant effects of social norms information, the strength of the effects over the longer‐term is very small and therefore this information is unlikely to provide any advantage in practice. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, only low or moderate quality evidence was noted for the effects reported in this review. Problems with study quality could result in estimates of social norms effects that are too high, so we cannot rule out the chance that the effects observed in this review may be overstated.
