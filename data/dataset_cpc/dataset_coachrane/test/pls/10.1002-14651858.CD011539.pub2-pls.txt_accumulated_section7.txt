Enzyme replacement therapies for infantile‐onset Pompe disease
Background 
Pompe disease was the first identified lysosomal storage disorder (inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build‐up of various toxic materials in the body's cells). It causes damage to muscle by the accumulation of glycogen (which is used as an energy source by the body) within the lysosome due to deficiency of an enzyme called acid alpha‐glucosidase (GAA). There is a broad spectrum of Pompe disease types with infantile‐onset (starting during childhood) being the most severe. The usual presenting features of the infantile form are worsening weakness of the heart, muscles used in breathing and skeletal muscle. The tongue and the liver may be enlarged. This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy in children with infantile‐onset Pompe disease.

Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapy in children with Pompe disease. We found no randomised trials (where people taking part in the trial have equal chances of being in the treatment or the control group) comparing the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy to another intervention, no intervention or placebo (a 'dummy' drug). We found one trial (18 children) that compared two doses of recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (an enzyme replacement therapy): 20 mg/kg every two weeks (low dose) and 40 mg/kg every two weeks (high dose). The duration of treatment ranged from 52 weeks (the length of the original study) to up to three years (including the extension phase of the study), with a median (the middle number) duration of treatment being 2.3 years.
