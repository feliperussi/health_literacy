Pregabalin for decreasing abdominal pain in people with chronic pancreatitis
Review question 
Is pregabalin useful in decreasing abdominal pain in people with chronic pancreatitis?
Background 
The pancreas is an abdominal organ that secretes several digestive enzymes into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also comprises the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones, including insulin. Chronic pancreatitis is long‐standing and progressive inflammation of the pancreas resulting in destruction and replacement of pancreatic tissue with fibrous tissue. This may lead to a shortage of digestive enzymes and insulin (helps regulate blood sugar), leading to diabetes (a lifelong condition in which a person's blood sugar level becomes too high). Alcohol is considered the main cause but others include: smoking, some drugs, and a variety of other disorders. Chronic abdominal pain is the major symptom of chronic pancreatitis. The pain is usually in the upper abdomen and is usually described as deep, penetrating, and radiating to the back. Various theories exist about the reason for pain in chronic pancreatitis. One theory is that the disease process affects the nerves supplying the pancreas. Pregabalin inhibits the transmission of pain through the nerves. Pregabalin may decrease pain in people with chronic pancreatitis, but may also produce a number of side‐effects. Some common side‐effects include: excessive sleepiness, blurred vision, double vision, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting, excessive wind, feeling excited, confusion, reduced sexual desire, irritability, feeling dizzy, feeling unsteady, tremors, speech difficulty, tingling or pricking ('pins and needles') sensation, and disturbances of attention and memory. Less frequent, but serious adverse events include: fainting episodes, heart failure, and reversible kidney failure.
