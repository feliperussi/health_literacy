Surgical and radiological interventions for treating symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection 
Review question 
This review was conducted to establish whether a surgical operation or a keyhole endovascular treatment, such placement of stent in addition to blood‐thinning medication would improve outcomes in people with cervical artery dissection for whom treatment with blood‐thinning medication alone does not improve persistent or worsening symptoms of stroke. The outcomes which we wished to assess are permanent brain damage and long‐term disability from stroke. 
Background 
Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. There are two of each artery, a carotid artery on the right and one on the left of the neck, and a vertebral artery on the right and one on the left of the neck. When tears occur in the walls of these arteries, clots can form inside the artery. These clots can then break away from the artery wall and travel to the brain to cause a stroke. The standard way of treating tears in these arteries is to give patients medications which thin the blood and reduce clot formation. However, sometimes patients continue to get symptoms of stroke, and their condition worsens despite being on maximum dose medication. 
Search date 
We performed a thorough and comprehensive review of the literature to look for clinical trials which could help us to answer the review question. The evidence is current to March 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for trials which were conducted in an objective way and designed specifically to compare either surgery or radiological intervention to medical therapy alone. 
Key results 
We did not find any trials that matched the criteria of the review. Therefore, there is no available objective evidence that an operation or a radiological procedure can benefit patients who continue to have symptoms of stroke despite medical therapy. We did find a number of reports from experienced groups of doctors that operations and radiological interventions were safe in their hands. However, we found no evidence that this could be applicable to other hospitals and clinical teams. Therefore, large scale, well‐conducted studies are required to answer the review question.
