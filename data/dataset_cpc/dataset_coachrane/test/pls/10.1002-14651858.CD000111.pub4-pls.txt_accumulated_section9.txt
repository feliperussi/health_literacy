Immersion in water in labour and birth
What is the issue? 
To assess the effects of water immersion (waterbirth) during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Why is this important? 
Many women choose to labour and give birth in water (water immersion) and this practice is becoming more popular in many countries, particularly in midwifery‐led units. Therefore, it is important to understand more about the benefits of water immersion in labour and birth for women and their newborns, along with any risks. 
It is important to examine whether immersion in water during the first and/or the second stage of labour has the potential to maximise women's ability to manage labour pain, and to have a normal birth without increasing the risk of an adverse (harmful) event. Adverse events might be an increased risk of infection for women and/or their newborn; an increased likelihood of a serious tear to the perineum (the area between anus and vagina), and it may make estimating blood loss more difficult in the event of a haemorrhage. In assessing the benefits, we consider well‐being to cover both physical and psychological health. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 15 trials (3663 women). All the trials compared immersion in water with no immersion in water: eight during the first stage of labour, two during the second stage of labour (waterbirth) only, four during the first and second stages of labour, and one early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. The evidence was of moderate to very low quality. No trial compared immersion in water with other forms of pain management. 
Water immersion during the first stage of labour probably results in fewer women having an epidural, but probably makes little or no difference to the number of women who have a normal vaginal birth, instrumental birth, caesarean section or a serious perineal tear. We are uncertain about the effect on the amount of blood loss after birth because the quality of the evidence was very low. Labouring in water also may make little or no difference to babies being admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or developing infections. Stillbirths and baby deaths were not reported.
