Vitamin A supplementation to prevent deaths and short‐ and long‐term illness in very low birth weight infants 
Review question: Does supplementation with vitamin A prevent death, chronic lung injury and long‐term neurodevelopmental disability in very low birth weight infants compared with a control (placebo or no supplementation)? 
Background: Vitamin A is a group of fat‐soluble compounds used by the body for regulation and promotion of growth and differentiation of many cells, including cells in the retina of the eye and the cells that line the air passages in the lungs. Preterm infants have low vitamin A levels at birth. This may contribute to an increased risk of developing chronic lung disease and hence a requirement for oxygen. It is possible that an additional vitamin A supplement may reduce complications of prematurity, including abnormal development of the retina (retinopathy), bleeding in the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage), and damage to the gut from inflammation (necrotising enterocolitis) as well as reducing respiratory infections. Too much vitamin A is potentially harmful as it can raise intracranial pressure and cause skin and mucous membrane changes (injury or lesions), and vomiting. 
Study characteristics: Eleven trials were included in this review, ten comparing vitamin A with a control (placebo or no supplementation) and one comparing different vitamin A regimens. The search for eligible trials was updated in May 2016. 
Results: Compared to the control group, supplementing very low birth weight infants with vitamin A appears to have a small benefit in reducing the risk of death or oxygen requirement at one month of age and the risk of chronic lung disease (oxygen requirement) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (moderate‐quality evidence). There was a marginal reduction of the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease (moderate‐quality evidence). Although there is a statistical reduction in chronic lung disease, these findings are consistent with either a meaningful impact on chronic lung disease or a negligible impact. The one trial that investigated neurodevelopmental status at 18 to 22 months of age correcting for prematurity found no evidence of benefit or harm associated with vitamin A supplementation compared to control (low‐quality evidence). No adverse effects of vitamin A supplementation were reported, but it was noted that intramuscular injections of vitamin A were painful.
