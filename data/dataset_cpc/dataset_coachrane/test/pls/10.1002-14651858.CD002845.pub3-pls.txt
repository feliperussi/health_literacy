Do antifungal medicines for vaginal yeast infections (thrush) work better if taken by mouth (orally) or placed in the vagina (intravaginally)? 
What is thrush? 
Thrush (also called candidiasis) is a common vaginal infection caused by a type of fungus called a yeast. Symptoms include itching and irritation around the vagina and a white discharge. Thrush is usually harmless but it can be uncomfortable. 
Thrush is usually treated with antifungal medicines. These can be taken by mouth (orally) or placed in the vagina (intravaginally). 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if oral antifungal medicines work better than intravaginal antifungal medicines to treat thrush infections. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies of antifungal medicines to treat thrush that compared an oral antifungal with an intravaginal antifungal. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatments. 
We were interested in how well ‐ and how fast ‐ antifungal medicines could get rid of yeast infections and improve symptoms; whether they had any unwanted effects; and whether women preferred oral or intravaginal treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 29 August 2019. 
What we found 
We found 26 studies in 5007 women with thrush who were treated with antifungal medicines called azoles. The studies were conducted in Europe, the USA, Thailand, Iran, Japan and Nigeria. Eight azoles were studied: 2 oral (fluconazole and itraconazole) and 6 intravaginal (butoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, sertaconazole and terconazole). 
The studies measured whether oral and intravaginal antifungal medicines led to:
• no symptoms (clinical cure);• no yeasts found in the vagina (mycological cure); or• unwanted effects that caused women to stop treatment. 
No studies reported the costs of the oral or intravaginal antifungal medicines.
What are the results of our review? 
Clinical cure (no symptoms) was similar for oral and intravaginal antifungal medicines in both the short term (5 to 15 days; 13 studies), and long term (2 to 12 weeks; 9 studies). Whether an antifungal medicine is oral or intravaginal probably makes little to no difference to getting rid of thrush symptoms. 
However, oral antifungal medicines probably cleared yeast from the vagina (mycological cure) better than intravaginal ones in both the short term (19 studies) and long term (13 studies). 
Only three women stopped using their antifungal medicine because of unwanted effects (23 studies); the risk of women stopping treatment with oral or intravaginal antifungal medicines is low. 
The numbers of unwanted effects reported were similar: whether an antifungal medicine is oral or intravaginal might make little to no difference to unwanted effects (13 studies). Headache and digestive symptoms were more common with oral antifungal medicines; unwanted effects of intravaginal antifungals commonly affected only the vaginal area. 
Our results suggested that women might prefer taking an oral antifungal medicine to an intravaginal one (12 studies). 
Whether an antifungal medicine is oral or intravaginal may make little to no difference to how quickly thrush gets better. 
How reliable are these results? 
We are moderately confident in our findings for clinical and mycological cure of thrush. These results might change if further evidence becomes available. We are confident about the low risk of women stopping treatment because of unwanted effects of antifungal medicines, and further evidence is unlikely change this. 
We are less confident about the numbers of unwanted effects, preferred treatment, and how quickly symptoms get better. These results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Ten studies received support from pharmaceutical companies; this could have affected how the studies were designed, conducted and reported. The results from some studies varied widely and were not reported consistently; and the women knew which treatment they had, which could have affected the results reported. 
Conclusions 
Oral antifungal medicines probably clear yeast from the vagina better than intravaginal antifungal medicines, although there is probably little to no difference between them for getting rid of thrush symptoms. 
The risk of women stopping treatment because of unwanted effects is low for both oral and intravaginal antifungal medicines.
