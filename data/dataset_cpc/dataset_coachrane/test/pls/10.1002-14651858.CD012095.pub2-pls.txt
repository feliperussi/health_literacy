Benefits and harms of celecoxib for treating people with rheumatoid arthritis
Review question 
We aimed to assess the benefits (improvement in pain, stiffness, physical function) and harms (gut and heart problems) of celecoxib compared with other similar drugs or a fake drug (placebo) for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Background 
Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto‐immune disease that causes the lining of joints to become inflamed making them painful, stiff and swollen. The small joints of hands and feet are usually affected first. Presently, there is no cure; treatment aims to achieve remission or delay disease progression to improve mobility and reduce pain, swelling and stiffness. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib is a selective NSAID which may help to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to May 18, 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies published between 1998 and 2014 that involved 3988 adults (average age 54 years), most of whom were women (73%). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis for an average of 9.2 years. 
Studies compared celecoxib with another treatment; 1786 participants received celecoxib and 2202 received either placebo or a traditional NSAID (tNSAID). 
Five studies were supported or funded by the pharmaceutical industry.
Key results 
When compared with placebo, of every 100 people who received celecoxib, 15 had symptom improvement after 4 to 12 weeks. People who took celecoxib rated their pain 11 points lower (on a scale of 0 to 100) after 12 weeks. 
Results were inconclusive about improvements in physical function and numbers of people who developed gastroduodenal ulcers over 3 mm diameter when we compared celecoxib and placebo. Evidence was also inconclusive about harms that appear shortly after use of the drugs. None of the studies that compared celecoxib and placebo reported heart attacks or strokes. 
Results about improvement in pain and physical function were inconclusive when celecoxib was compared with tNSAIDs. A small improvement was found in relation to a scoring system (ACR20) used by doctors to assess people with rheumatoid arthritis. Of every 100 people who took celecoxib: 13 fewer developed gastroduodenal ulcers over 3 mm diameter; and 7 fewer withdrew from studies compared with people receiving tNSAIDs. 
Celecoxib may improve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and alleviate pain more than placebo, but probably provides little or no difference in physical function improvement. 
Quality of evidence 
Evidence was rated as moderate or low quality due to methodological shortcomings and few observed events indicating harms.
