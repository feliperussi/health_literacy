Yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care
Review question 
Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with non‐standard care? 
Background 
Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a 'package of care'. Non‐standard care can consist of talking therapies, expressive therapies (art, dance, drama, music and writing) and other forms of exercise. 
Searching for evidence 
In May 2018, the Information Specialist for Cochrane Schizophrenia searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of randomised controlled trials for trials of people with schizophrenia. Thirty studies were found that could be relevant. The review authors carefully inspected full‐text versions of these studies, checking that they were randomised controlled trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive, in addition to their ongoing care, either yoga as part of a package of care or another type of non‐standard care intervention. Twenty‐nine of these studies did not meet the above inclusion criteria and are excluded from the review. One study is 'ongoing' as data are not available at the moment. 
Key results 
Currently, there are no data available from randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of yoga as part of a package of care compared with non‐standard care for people with schizophrenia.
