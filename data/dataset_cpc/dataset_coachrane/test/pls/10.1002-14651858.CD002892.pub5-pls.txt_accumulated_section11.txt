Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers
Background  
Healthcare workers suffer from work‐related or occupational stress. Often this is because healthcare workers face high expectations and they may not have enough time, skills and social support at work. This can lead to severe distress, burnout or physical illness. In the end, healthcare workers may be unable to provide high quality healthcare services. Stress and burnout can also be costly because affected healthcare workers take sick leave and may even change jobs. 
We evaluated how well different ways to prevent healthcare workers' stress or burnout work. 
Study characteristics  
We included 58 studies that included altogether 7188 participants. Fiftyfour of the included studies were randomised controlled studies and four were non‐randomised studies. We categorised the interventions as either cognitive‐behavioural training, mental and physical relaxation, or organisational changes. 
Key findings and quality of the evidence  
Cognitive‐behavioural interventions 
According to six studies, there was low‐quality evidence that cognitive‐behavioural training decreased stress with about 13% when compared to no intervention and when measured at follow‐up periods ranging from less than a month up to two years. It is unclear how relevant this reduction is for a person with stress. The results were similar when cognitive‐behavioural training was combined with relaxation. However, in three studies, stress levels were similar after a cognitive‐behavioural training course compared to other training that was not focused on stress management but on the content of care. 
Mental and physical relaxation interventions 
In 17 studies there was low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that both mental and physical relaxation led to a reduction of 23% in stress levels compared to no intervention.
