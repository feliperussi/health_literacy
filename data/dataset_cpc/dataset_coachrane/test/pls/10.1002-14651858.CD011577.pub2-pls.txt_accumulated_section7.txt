The optimum transfusion strategy for anaemic patients with bone marrow failure disorders receiving supportive treatment 
Review Question 
A restrictive transfusion policy involves giving a red blood cell transfusion if the oxygen‐carrying capacity of blood (haemoglobin) falls below a certain level. A liberal transfusion policy involves giving a red blood cell transfusion at a higher haemoglobin level. 
This review aims to assess whether a restrictive or liberal transfusion policy is superior in terms of death (due to any cause), death due to bleeding, infection, transfusion reactions or iron overload, quality of life, frequency and length of hospital admissions, serious bleeding or infections, and number of red blood cell transfusions required. 
Background 
The bone marrow is where many types of blood cells are produced. Red blood cells are necessary to bring oxygen to all parts of the body, white blood cells fight against infection, and platelets in the blood help to form clots and prevent bleeding. Bone marrow failure can have different causes and can happen at birth or later in life, and may result in too few of any or all of the three types of blood cells in the body. Too few red blood cells causes a low haemoglobin level, called anaemia, which may result in poor delivery of oxygen to the body. This can cause shortness of breath, tiredness and has a significant impact on quality of life. 
Regular red blood cell transfusions are used to support patients and improve their quality of life when treatments that might cure the condition are not an option. However, there are certain risks involved with regular use of red blood cell transfusions, for example, transfusion reactions, transfusion‐transmitted infections and iron overload.
