Azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease?  Crohn's disease is a long‐term chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’. Periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What are azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine?  Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine are oral medications that reduce the body's immune responses and may reduce inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate?  The researchers investigated whether azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine maintains remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 30, 2015. 
What did the researchers find?  The researchers identified 11 studies that included a total of 881 participants. Seven studies including 532 participants compared azathioprine to a placebo (a fake medicine such as a sugar pill). Two studies including 166 participants compared azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine to aminosalicylates (the anti‐inflammatory medications mesalazine or sulfasalazine). One study including 77 participants compared azathioprine to budesonide (a steroid drug). One study including 31 participants compared 6‐mercaptopurine to methotrexate (an immunosuppressive drug). One study including 36 participants compared combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab (a biologic drug) to infliximab alone. One study with 147 participants compared the early use of azathioprine in patients with recently diagnosed Crohn's disease to a conventional management strategy. Two studies were rated as high quality. Three studies were rated as low quality. Six studies were rated as unclear quality due to a lack of information. 
A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) suggests that azathioprine (at daily doses of 1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease over a 6 to 18 month period. A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) showed no difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6‐mercaptopurine (1.0 mg/day) and aminosalicylate therapy (mesalazine 3 g/day or sulfasalazine 0.5g/15 kg/day). One small study (77 participants) suggests that azathioprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) may be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission over a one year period. One small study (36 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab alone. One small study (31 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between 6‐mercaptopurine (1 mg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week). One study (147 participants) failed to show any difference in time spent in remission between early azathioprine treatment and a conventional management strategy. An increased risk of side effects was seen in participants who received azathioprine. Some of these side effects such as leukopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood) were serious in nature. Common side effects included pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection. The choice to use azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine should be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of using these drugs. More research is needed to allow conclusions about the comparative effectiveness and side effects of azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine compared to other maintenance therapies such as methotrexate. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and side effects of the use of azathioprine with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with inactive Crohn's disease.
