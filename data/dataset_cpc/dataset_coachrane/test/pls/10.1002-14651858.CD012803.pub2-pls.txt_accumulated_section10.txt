Positive airway pressure for heart failure associated with central sleep apnoea
Background 
Ischaemic heart disease including heart failure is the most common cause of death in the world, and the incidence of the condition is rapidly increasing. Heart failure is characterised by symptoms such as fatigue and breathlessness during light activity, as well as disordered breathing during sleep. In particular, sleep disordered breathing, including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and obstructive sleep apnoea, is highly prevalent in people with chronic heart failure. 
Purpose: to assess the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for people with heart failure who experience CSA. 
Methods 
We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by means of a random method) that compared the effectiveness of PAP therapy versus usual care in people with heart failure who experience CSA. PAP therapy consisted of continuous PAP and adaptive servo‐ventilation, and usual care consisted of medical therapy based on relevant guidelines. The evidence is current to February 2019. 
Results 
We included 16 RCTs involving a total of 2125 participants. The effect of PAP therapy on on all‐cause mortality was uncertain. In addition, PAP therapy did not reduce cardiac‐related mortality, all‐cause rehospitalisation, and cardiac‐related rehospitalisation compared with usual care. However, PAP therapy showed some indication of an improvement in quality of life scores. Death due to pneumonia (N = 1, 3% of PAP group); cardiac arrest (N = 18, 3% of PAP group); heart transplantation (N = 8, 1% of PAP group); cardiac worsening (N = 3, 9% of PAP group); deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (N = 1, 3% of PAP group); and foot ulcer (N = 1, 3% of PAP group) were observed in the PAP therapy group, whereas cardiac arrest (N = 16, 2% of usual care group); heart transplantation (N = 12, 2% of usual care group); cardiac worsening (N = 5, 14% of usual care group); and duodenal ulcer (N = 1, 3% of usual care group) occurred in the usual care group across three trials. 
Quality of the evidence 
We assessed the the quality of evidence for many outcomes including cardiac‐related rehospitalisation as low or very low because variability among studies (heterogeneity) was high, a range of confidence intervals was wide, and random sequence generation and blinding of participants and personnel were poorly described.
