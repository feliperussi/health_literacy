Alarm interventions for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children
Review question 
Is alarm training an effective treatment for bedwetting in children?
Background 
Bedwetting is common in childhood and affects up to 20% of five‐year‐olds. Although children may spontaneously recover from this, bedwetting can have significant social, emotional and psychological effects on the child and their family. Treatments for bedwetting include alarms (activated by urination), behavioural interventions and drugs. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current up to 25 June 2018.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 74 trials involving 5983 children.
Study funding sources 
Three of the studies included in the review were funded or supported by a pharmaceutical company. 
Key results 
Alarms may be better than no treatment in terms of reducing the number of wet nights a week and increasing the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights. Alarms may increase the number of children remaining dry after stopping treatment, compared to no treatment. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between alarms and behavioural interventions (such as bladder training), or between alarms and desmopressin medication in terms of reducing the number of wet nights a week, increasing the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights and increasing the number of children remaining dry after stopping treatment. 
We are uncertain whether alarms reduce the number of wet nights more than placebo drugs, other types of alarms, tricyclics medication, or various treatments such as hypnotherapy or restricted diet. 
Alarm plus desmopressin may reduce the number of wet nights a week compared with desmopressin alone. It may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights and increase the number of children remaining dry after stopping treatment. Alarm plus dry‐bed training may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights compared to dry‐bed training alone, but we are uncertain if the response is maintained after stopping treatment.
