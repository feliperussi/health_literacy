Sacral nerve stimulation for treating faecal incontinence and constipation in adults
Importance of the review/Background: Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes stools without the usual control. Constipation is harder to define but generally describes a situation in which a person feels that their bowel opening is unsatisfactory (usually a combination of difficulty or infrequency of passing stools). Both conditions can severely affect people's quality of life. There are many non‐surgical treatments for both conditions but occasionally surgery is required when other options fail. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a relatively new treatment for these conditions. It involves implanting a battery‐powered stimulator unit in the buttock. This is connected to electrodes which rest on the nerves in the lower spine. The stimulator then continuously sends impulses to the nerves and muscles that control the bowel and anus. Initially, a temporary electrode lead is connected to a portable battery unit outside the body. If symptoms are improved enough, this is replaced by the implanted battery. 
Main findings: This review evaluated the published evidence for the use of SNS for patients with faecal incontinence or constipation from six trials of SNS for faecal incontinence (219 participants) and two trials of SNS for constipation (61 participants). Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. 
SNS for faecal incontinence: In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period.
