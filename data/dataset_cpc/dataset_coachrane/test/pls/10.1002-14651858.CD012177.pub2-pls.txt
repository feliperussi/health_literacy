The effects of interactive training of healthcare providers on the management of life‐threatening emergencies in hospital 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to find out if healthcare workers who work in hospitals and receive training where they can interact with learning materials and other workers give better healthcare during emergency situations. 
Key messages 
We are unsure about if interactive training for emergency situations improves healthcare, as there were conflicting results between studies and problems with the methods the trials used which could lead to false results. 
What was studied in this review? 
Hospital‐based healthcare workers need to be well prepared to react expertly to emergency situations that threaten people's lives. There are many training courses for this, some of which allow healthcare workers to interact with learning materials and other workers. However, we do not know if these training courses prepare healthcare workers to provide better healthcare. 
We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of interactive training compared to usual training or no training. We looked only at the type of study thought to be the strongest form of evidence, that is randomised trials (where participants could be assigned to either the training group or no/standard‐training group by chance). We looked for any effects on patient outcomes (e.g. survival or length of hospital stay), any effects on staff (e.g. improved skills in an actual clinical situation), or changes within the organisation (e.g. reorganisation of working patterns). We did not look at changes in a simulated environment. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found 11 studies that were relevant to this review. Nine of these focused on maternal and newborn health. Because there were so few studies and they all examined different effects of emergency training, we were unable to combine the results. 
All of the trials included weaknesses in their design that could have lead to inaccurate results. The certainty of evidence for our important outcomes focusing on changes to patient care/outcomes was very low, therefore based on the available evidence we are uncertain as to whether training of healthcare workers in the management of life‐threatening emergency situations made a difference to patients or organisations. The studies were paid by government, local hospitals, or charities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We looked at all of the studies examining this area up until March 2019.
