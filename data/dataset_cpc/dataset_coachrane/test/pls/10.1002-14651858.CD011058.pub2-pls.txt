Caregiver‐mediated exercises for improving outcomes after stroke
Review question 
What is the effect of performing exercises with a caregiver after stroke on outcome for people with stroke and burden for caregivers? 
Background 
Stroke is a major cause of acquired adult disability. Research has shown that more time spent on exercise therapy in the first weeks to months after stroke leads to better functioning. Due to lack of personnel and resources, in practice it is difficult to spend more time on exercise therapy in this period. One method to increase this exercise time, is to involve caregivers in performing exercise training together with a person with stroke. During this exercise training a therapist coaches patient and caregiver and an evaluation is planned on a regular basis. 
Study characteristics 
We identified nine clinical trials to October 2015, which all investigated some form of caregiver‐mediated exercises compared with usual care, no treatment (intervention), or another intervention that was not caregiver‐mediated. 
Key results 
We included 333 patient‐caregiver couples in the review. We found trials in which caregiver‐mediated exercises themselves were the studied subject (called CME‐core). In addition, we found trials in which the caregiver was the provider of another, already existing intervention. In the latter category, it was difficult to separate the effect of caregiver‐mediated exercises from the effect of the other intervention. 
We found evidence that caregiver‐mediated exercises could have a positive effect on patients' standing balance (low‐quality evidence) and quality of life (very low‐quality evidence) directly after the intervention. In the long term, we found very low‐quality evidence for a positive effect on walking distance. For speed of use of the arm and hand, we found low‐quality evidence in favour of the control group. 
We found no significant side effects or beneficial effects on caregiver strain; we judged the quality of this evidence as moderate (after intervention) to very low (long term). Furthermore, we found no significant effects for basic activities of daily living, such as dressing and bathing, after intervention (moderate‐quality evidence) or follow‐up (low‐quality evidence). In addition, we found no significant effects for extended activities of daily living, such as cooking and gardening, after intervention or at follow‐up (both low‐quality evidence). 
In the CME‐core analysis, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a positive effect of caregiver‐mediated exercises for basic activities of daily living. 
It can be concluded that caregiver‐mediated exercises may be a promising form of therapy to add to usual care. 
Quality of the evidence 
The number of included trials was small and the level of evidence was of very low to moderate quality. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution.
