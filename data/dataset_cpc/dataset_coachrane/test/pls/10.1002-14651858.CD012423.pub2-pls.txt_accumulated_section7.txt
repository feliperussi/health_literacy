Training healthcare providers to respond to intimate partner violence against women
Review question 
Does intimate partner violence (IPV) training for healthcare providers (HCPs) improve their: 
· attitudes or beliefs, or both, towards IPV,· readiness to respond to those affected by IPV,· knowledge of IPV,· referral of women being subjected to IPV to specialist services,· actual response to women subjected to IPV (such as validation or safety planning),· identification and documentation of IPV, and· the mental health of survivors of IPV? 
Background 
Intimate partner violence is associated with a wide range of short‐ and long‐term physical and mental health problems. These include injuries and death, depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder, unplanned/unwanted pregnancies and gynaecological problems, to name a few. Health problems can last beyond the duration of the violence and women who have experienced violence are more likely to seek health care compared to women who have never experienced violence. 
Women are more likely to trust HCPs with a disclosure of violence. For some women, a healthcare setting may be one of the few places women can attend on their own. HCPs (such as nurses, doctors, midwives, etc.) are therefore ideally situated to identify and provide support for women affected by IPV. Many healthcare settings provide clinical guidelines or training or both on how to identify and respond to IPV. We wanted to find out what difference training makes to IPV‐related HCP attitudes, knowledge and response, including the care provided to women affected by IPV and whether it improved their health outcomes, including their mental health, or made a difference to their exposure to IPV.
