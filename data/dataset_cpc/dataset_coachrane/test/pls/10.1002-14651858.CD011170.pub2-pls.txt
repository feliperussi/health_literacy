Psychological therapies versus medication for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults 
Why is this review important? 
Panic disorder is common and harmful to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and medication (usually antidepressants or benzodiazepines) are effective against panic disorder. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the superiority and acceptability of these two forms of treatment, and such a review is necessary to improve treatment planning for this disorder. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Adult patients, professionals working in mental health services, and general practitioners.
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
The present review aims to answer the following questions:
• Are psychological therapies more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
• Are psychological therapies more acceptable than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases to find all trials published between 1950 and September 2015 comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants or benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. To be included in the review, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. 
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the review. We rated the overall quality of the evidence from these studies as very low to moderate. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
The superiority or inferiority of psychological therapies over drugs remains unclear with regard to treatment effectiveness and acceptability. 
None of the studies reported information regarding long‐term effectiveness and quality of life. 
What should happen next? 
The review authors recommend that future research should use less biased psychological therapies, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and report information related to the risk of study bias.
