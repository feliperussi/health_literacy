Treatment for swallowing difficulties in hereditary ataxia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for management of swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) in people with one of the many hereditary ataxias. 
Background 
Hereditary ataxias are a varied group of disorders that mainly affect a person's ability to co‐ordinate movement. Symptoms become worse over time. Hereditary ataxias can also affect eyesight, speech, thinking, and swallowing. Although swallowing problems are common in ataxia, we do not know enough about their nature and severity. The loss of an effective and safe swallow can dramatically affect health and well‐being. Improving difficulties of eating and drinking is an important goal in the clinical care of people with hereditary ataxia. 
We wanted to discover if any treatments for dysphagia benefit people with hereditary ataxias. People with swallowing problems can experience malnutrition (lack of adequate nourishment), dehydration (lack of fluids), and pneumonia secondary to aspiration (lung infection secondary to food or liquids entering the lungs), which can be fatal. Any treatments aiming to prevent these problems or improve swallowing were of interest in the review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of treatments for swallowing difficulties in hereditary ataxia. Well performed RCTs provide the best quality evidence. Quasi‐randomised trials allocate participants to treatment using methods that are not completely random, such as by date of birth, case record number, or day of the week. No studies met these pre‐specified inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found no RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of treatment for swallowing difficulties in hereditary ataxia. 
Conclusions 
The absence of high quality studies examining the efficacy of treatments for dysphagia in these disorders means than no conclusions can be drawn on the most appropriate treatment of dysphagia and highlights the urgent need for well controlled trials in the field. 
The evidence is current to September 2015.
