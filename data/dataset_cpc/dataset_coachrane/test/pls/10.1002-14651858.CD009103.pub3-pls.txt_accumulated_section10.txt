Healthcare interventions for reducing the risk of future stroke in people with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) 
Review question 
How effective are healthcare interventions for preventing a recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events in people who have had a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA: also known as a mini‐stroke)? 
Background 
Stroke and TIA are diseases caused by interruptions in the blood supply to the brain. People who experience a stroke or TIA are at risk of future stroke. Several medications and lifestyle changes can be used to lower stroke risk by improving the control of modifiable risk factors such as blood pressure, blood fats, being overweight, raised blood sugar, and the use of preventive medications. These risk factors are often not managed effectively following a stroke or TIA. It is important to identify healthcare interventions that can help prevent stroke by improving these risk factors. Interventions in this review targeted patients or clinicians, or both (aimed at education or changing behaviour, or both); and organisations (e.g. changing the way services were provided).

Study characteristics 
This updated review included 16 new studies involving 25,819 participants, resulting in a total of 42 studies including 33,840 with stroke or TIA whose average age ranged from 60 to 74.3 years. Most studies took place in primary care or community settings. Sixteen studies involved educational or behavioural interventions for participants and 26 studies mostly involved organisational interventions. Most interventions lasted for between three and 12 months, with follow‐up from three months up to three years.
