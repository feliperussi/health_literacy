Interventions for managing bleeding after tooth removal
Review question 
We conducted this review to assess different interventions for treating bleeding after tooth removal. 
Background 
After tooth extraction, it is normal for the area to bleed and then clot, generally within a few minutes. It is abnormal if bleeding continues without clot formation, or lasts beyond 8 to 12 hours; this is known as post‐extraction bleeding (PEB). Such bleeding incidents can cause distress for patients, who might need emergency dental consultations and interventions. The causes of PEB can be local, a systemic disease, or a medication. To control this bleeding, many local and systemic methods have been practised, based on the clinician's expertise. To inform clinicians about the best treatment, evidence is needed from studies where people have been randomly allocated to one of at least two different groups, which receive different treatments, or no treatment (i.e. 'randomised controlled trials' or RCTs). 
Study characteristics 
Authors working with Cochrane Oral Health updated this review of RCTs that assess interventions to treat bleeding after tooth removal. The original review was published in June 2016. For this version, we searched the medical and dental literature to 24 January 2018. We found no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for our review. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
This review revealed that there is no RCT evidence for the effectiveness of any available intervention for treating post‐extraction bleeding. High quality RCTs are needed to help clinicians and patients make informed choices about treatment options.
