Thyroxine replacement therapy for subfertile women with autoimmune thyroid disease or mildly underactive thyroid 
Review question 
Does hormone supplementation with thyroxine (levothyroxine) improve fertility outcomes after in vitro fertilisation (a fertility treatment where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (a fertility treatment where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg) for women diagnosed with presence of thyroid antibodies (autoimmune thyroid disease; ATD) or mildly underactive thyroid? 
Background 
Thyroid disease is the second most common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Research has shown a higher rate of miscarriage and reduced fertility in women with underactive (slow‐working) thyroid, with both thyroid hormones measured in blood testing being low. However, there is also a mild variant of this thyroid disease, the so‐called 'subclinical' or mildly underactive thyroid in which affected people show no symptoms and only have a mild change in one of the thyroid hormones when testing blood levels. Another mild variant of thyroid disease is the so‐called 'ATD,' with normal thyroid hormone levels, but the presence of thyroid antibodies. Antibodies could attack a woman's own body cells, and the presence of thyroid antibodies is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage. To date, it is unclear what these mild subtypes of thyroid disease do to female fertility and pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
Cochrane authors performed a comprehensive literature search of the standard medical databases to 8 April 2019 in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Information Specialist, for randomised clinical trials (RCTs: clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating the effect of thyroid hormones (levothyroxine) for women diagnosed with ATD or mildly underactive thyroid who were planning to undergo assisted reproduction. Two authors independently selected studies, evaluated them, extracted data and attempted to contact the authors where data were missing.
