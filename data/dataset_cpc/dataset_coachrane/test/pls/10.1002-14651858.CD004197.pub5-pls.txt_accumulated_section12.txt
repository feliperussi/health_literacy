Different ways of giving antibiotics to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
What is the best way of using antibiotics to eliminate lung infections caused by a germ called Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition where the airways often become blocked with mucus. It is associated with chest infections, which can lead to progressive breathing failure and death. A germ called Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often the cause of infection and is difficult to treat successfully, once infection has become established. 
We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for eliminating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis to see if any single treatment works best and is more cost‐effective.

Study characteristics 
We included seven trials with 744 people with cystic fibrosis of both sexes, any age and both mild and more severe lung disease. The trials lasted from 28 days to 27 months. We could not combine many results as trials used different treatments. Two trials compared tobramycin to placebo (a dummy treatment). Three trials combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin in the experimental group but used different comparators ‐ one compared the antibiotic combination to no treatment, one to inhaled tobramycin and the third to oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled tobramycin. Another trial considered inhaled tobramycin and compared 28 days of treatment to 56 days. The final trial compared regular cycles of inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to only treating with inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) based on the results of cultures grown in the laboratory. 
Key results 
Two small trials (38 people) treating early infection showed that after two months inhaled antibiotics were better than no treatment and eliminated Pseudomonas aeruginosa in most people. One of these trials reported for longer and suggested that this effect may last for up to 12 months. Another small trial (26 people) which lasted two years showed that treating early infection with a combination of inhaled and oral antibiotics was better than no treatment for eliminating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A trial comparing 28 days of nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation (88 people) to 56 days showed both were equally tolerated and successful at eliminating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four direct comparisons of oral or inhaled antibiotics (or combinations of both), including one with 223 people, did not find a difference between different antibiotic combinations. A recent trial in 306 children (aged up to 12 years) compared a regular cycle of inhaled tobramycin (with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to treatment only when it was shown that a child was infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and showed that when children were given a regular cycle of inhaled tobramycin (with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) fewer of them grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa from their sputum. The trial report made an adjustment for age and did not show any difference in the number of times Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown from samples between the groups, nor was there any difference in the length of time until the children had their next chest infection.
