Cabergoline for levodopa‐induced complications in Parkinson's disease
In the later stages of Parkinson's disease, side effects occur because of the use of levodopa treatment. These consist of involuntary writhing movements (choreoathetosis), painful cramps in the legs (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose referred to as 'end‐of‐dose deterioration' or the 'wearing‐off effect'. Dopamine agonist drugs act by mimicking levodopa in the brain, but they do not cause these long‐term treatment complications when used as initial therapy. For this reason, dopamine agonists have for some years been added once these problems develop in the hope of improving them. Cabergoline is a new dopamine agonist recently licensed in the UK for the treatment of later Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will examine the trials performed with this drug to see how effective it is and what side effects it causes. 
Cabergoline has been compared with inactive placebo in two smaller and shorter (6 ‐ 12 weeks) studies and one larger, medium term trial (24 weeks). These trials included 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The average reduction in the time patients spent in the immobile off state was 1.1 hours greater with cabergoline compared with placebo, although this was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for activities of daily living and physical functioning. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. Levodopa dose reduction was greater with cabergoline by 145 mg per day. There was a trend towards more side effects with cabergoline but towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline treatment.
