Immune therapy for lumbosacral plexopathy (a condition that affects the network of nerves at the base of the spine) of unknown cause 
Review question 
Do treatments that act on the immune system have effects on idiopathic lumbosacral plexopathy (ILSP)? 
Background 
ILSP is an uncommon disorder of the peripheral nerves and lumbosacral plexus that causes asymmetrical pain and weakness of the lower limbs. The lumbosacral plexus is a network of nerves near the base of the spine. This is where nerve fibres emerging from the spine as nerve roots reorganise themselves into peripheral nerves that extend into the legs. In ILSP, a process damages this nerve network, and changes in sensation can occur, such as tingling, and oversensitivity to touch. There may also be effects on the part of the nervous system that controls unconscious body functions (the autonomic nervous system). The cause or causes of ILSP are not clear, but it is thought that blood vessels become inflamed for reasons we do not yet know, and this reduces blood flow to the network of nerves. Some experts think that the reduced blood flow damages the nerves. It is possible that medication that reduces inflammation could be beneficial. 
Results 
After a wide search for high quality studies of treatment (randomized controlled trials, or similar), we found no trials in ILSP of any form of therapy that acts on the immune system or reduces inflammation. There is presently no evidence from any trial to show whether immunotherapies help people with ILSP.
