A comparison of gefitinib with no therapy or chemotherapy for non‐small cell lung cancer 
Review question 
Do patients with non‐small cell lung cancer live longer if they are given gefitinib?
Background 
Non‐small cell lung cancer (the most common type of lung cancer) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. People diagnosed with advanced lung cancer may be offered chemotherapy. 
Some lung cancers have been found to have a gene mutation, which is an alteration in the chromosome sequence inside the cells. This mutation affects the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a switch on the surface of the cell leading to uncontrolled growth and spread. Gefitinib is a drug that targets cells with mutated EGFR, thus stopping their growth. Studies have found that this mutation is more commonly found in people who are non‐smokers, female, of Asian heritage and with adenocarcinoma (a type of lung cancer). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant trials up to 17 February 2017. There were a total of 35 studies conducted between 2000 and 2017, evaluating 12,089 participants from multiple countries including North America, Europe and Asia. 
Key results 
This review showed that patients with advanced lung cancer do not live longer when treated with gefitinib when compared with no other treatment or chemotherapy. In people whose lung cancer has worsened after initial therapy, gefitinib may prolong the time before the cancer progresses further, but only in a selected group of patients of Asian ethnicity or with EGFR mutations. Combining gefitinib with chemotherapy probably increases the time to cancer progression over either gefitinib or chemotherapy alone. For EGFR‐mutation positive patients who are stable after chemotherapy, ongoing gefitinib has been shown to improve survival when compared to placebo.
