Endovascular thrombectomy and intra‐arterial interventions for acute ischaemic stroke
Review question 
This review addressed whether endovascular thrombectomy (removal of a blood clot in a blood vessel using a mechanical device) or intra‐arterial thrombolysis (injecting clot‐dissolving drugs directly into the clot), or both, provide better outcomes than standard treatment alone in stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel. 
Background 
The majority of disabling strokes are due to a blockage of a large blood vessel by a blood clot in the brain. Such strokes lead to brain tissue damage because of oxygen deprivation. An ischaemic stroke is a stroke where the restriction of blood flow causes damage and death to the surrounding tissue due to oxygen shortage. For these patients, the most intuitive means of treatment is removal of the blockage by either injecting clot‐dissolving drugs directly into the clot or removal of the blood clot using a mechanical device, or both. Prompt treatment can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred, leading to a good recovery. However, these treatments can also cause bleeding in the brain, which can result in poorer outcomes. We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) of both endovascular mechanical thrombectomy and intra‐arterial thrombolysis to establish whether they are safe and effective treatments for stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel.

Study characteristics 
Randomised controlled trials of endovascular thrombectomy or intra‐arterial thrombolysis, or both, plus routine medical treatment compared with routine medical treatment alone in people with a definite acute ischaemic stroke.
