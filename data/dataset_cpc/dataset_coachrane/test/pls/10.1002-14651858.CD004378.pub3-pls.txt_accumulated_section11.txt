Day three versus day two embryo transfer following in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
Review question 
Cochrane review authors investigated whether transferring an embryo on Day two or on Day three of development makes a difference to pregnancy outcomes in women having in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. 
Background 
Embryo transfer has usually been performed two days after oocyte (egg) retrieval; however, developments in culture media and embryo culture methods have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. This means that more assessments can be undertaken to look at the implantation chances for each embryo. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 15 randomised trials meeting the review inclusion criteria. These include 14 trials reporting data from 2894 women; one trial reported data from 969 cycles so could not be included in meta‐analysis. All of the included studies were parallel‐design randomised controlled trials conducted in Brazil, Chile, Singapore, Argentina, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Israel, Canada, Greece, Japan, Italy, Norway and Belgium. The evidence is current to April 2016. 
Key results 
Only three of 15 studies reported on live birth as an outcome. We found that there was no clear evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. There were no data reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
Allocation concealment was poorly reported in the included studies and blinding was not possible (although we feel this is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods (risk of bias), lack of agreement between studies (inconsistency), low event rates and lack of accuracy (imprecision) for some outcomes and poor reporting of live birth outcomes (selective reporting).
