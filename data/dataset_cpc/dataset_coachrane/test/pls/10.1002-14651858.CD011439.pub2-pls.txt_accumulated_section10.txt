Can exhaled nitric oxide be used to adjust asthma medications in children with asthma?
Background 
We investigated whether exhaled (breathing out) nitric oxide (a marker in the breath which can show a type of lung inflammation) can be useful to adjust asthma medications in children with asthma instead of following the usual ways that asthma medications are adjusted to get the best dose to control the asthma. Exhaled nitric oxide levels are easily obtained by getting the person to breathe into a commercially available analyser. 
Study characteristics 
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared adjustment of asthma medications by either usual clinical care (control group) versus using exhaled nitric oxide. The participants included in the trials had asthma diagnosed as per relevant asthma guidelines. 
The evidence is current to June 2016 when the searches were last completed.
The review included nine studies (involving 1426 children) that varied in a several ways including length of the study, exhaled nitric oxide cut‐off levels used for altering medicines and the way each study defined flare‐ups or attacks (called exacerbations). The studies ranged from 6 to 12 months in length. The exhaled nitric oxide cut‐off values used by the different studies as a basis for decreasing or increasing medicines also varied. 
The mean age of the participants ranged from 10 to 14 years old.
Key results 
In this review, we found that guiding asthma medicines based on exhaled nitric oxide (compared to a control group) was beneficial in reducing the number of children who had at least one exacerbation during the study. In the control group where therapy was guided according to clinical symptoms, 40 children out of 100 had at least one exacerbation over 48.5 weeks, compared to 28 out of 100 children where treatment was guided by exhaled nitric oxide. However, we found no difference between groups in other measures of asthma severity that impact on day‐to‐day clinical symptoms or inhaled corticosteroid dose (medications used to control asthma). Therefore, using exhaled nitric oxide levels to adjust asthma therapy may reduce the number of attacks that children with asthma have but does not impact on the day‐to‐day symptoms.
