Treatments for ulcers (wounds) and other skin changes in people with leprosy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of treatments (e.g. education, self‐care, dressings, skin care, or footwear) designed to prevent or treat skin damage in people with leprosy and those with potential damage to peripheral nerves. Treatments could be compared against usual care, no treatment, or another treatment. Evidence is current to July 2018. 
Background 
Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is a long‐lasting, infectious global disease, which may lead to complications like injuries and development of wounds (ulcers), particularly on the feet. Long‐term nerve and muscle damage impacts a person's quality of life, leading to mental and financial difficulties. Late diagnosis is the greatest cause of disability, so the key to effective management is early diagnosis and treatment, and early recognition and management of nerve damage, combined with effective health education to prevent limb damage. This review aimed to address uncertainties regarding the best way to prevent and treat skin damage. 
Study characteristics 
We included 14 trials (854 participants with leprosy). Participants mostly had only one wound on one foot. Wounds were mainly simple (not infected) and varied in size and depth, and were less than one year old; some wounds were more complicated. Participants ranged from 18 to 74 years old. In the 11 studies which reported gender, more men were included. Studies were conducted in Brazil, Ethiopia, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, and India, in mainly outpatient clinics. Most studies did not report funding sources. 
Treatments were mostly compared to dry dressings or dressings soaked in differing solutions. Other comparisons included special plaster, canvas shoes, and foot soak. 
Key results 
Treatments evaluated included: laser therapy, light‐emitting diode (LED), zinc tape or paste, pentoxifylline injections, exposure to pulsed magnetic fields, wax therapy, ketanserin gel, amniotic membrane gel, phenytoin powder, plaster shoes, and footwear. Outcomes were measured from the beginning of treatment. The following key results are based on very low‐certainty evidence, so we are not sure of these results.
