Almost all maternal deaths occur in the developing world. Bleeding during labour is responsible for at least a quarter of these deaths, with the majority due to postpartum haemorrhage. Failure of the muscles of the uterus to contract properly with separation of the placenta is the most common cause of postpartum haemorrhage. One of the leading causes of maternal deaths and prevention of this includes routine use of uterotonic drugs after childbirth before delivery of the placenta. Umbilical vein injection of the drug has been suggested as it provides the treatment directly to the placenta and uterine wall. Higher doses could be used with reduced side‚Äêeffects. Therapeutic use of the umbilical route of delivering uterotonics has been assessed showing the effectiveness of its use depending upon the amount and content of the infusion. This review included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1118 women and assessed six of these studies (involving 394 women) comparing umbilical vein injection of normal saline with or without oxytocin. Other comparisons did not provide the required information. With umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin versus umbilical vein injection of saline solution there was no evidence of a difference in the amount of blood lost, duration of the third stage of labour or need for manual removal of a retained placenta. routine use of umbilical injection after childbirth to deliver any infusion, though the combined results of the small number of relevant studies showed no evidence of effect and further research is needed to make a conclusion. There is a need for training in the technique and a possible higher cost of materials.
