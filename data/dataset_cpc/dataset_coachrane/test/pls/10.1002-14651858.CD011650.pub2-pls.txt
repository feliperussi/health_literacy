Treatment of very early‐ or early‐stage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from cancer arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies cancer based on patient's life expectancy. It is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver functions, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with very early‐ or early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single cancer or multiple small cancers confined to the liver, have good liver function, and no restriction of activities. There is significant uncertainty in the management of early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we searched literature databases for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on the topic until September 2016. We excluded trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time, we planned to use advanced methods described in full in the review. 
Study characteristics of included trials 
Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery (removal of part of the liver containing cancer) versus radiofrequency ablation (cancer destruction using heat generated by electric current) in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery; and 14 trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‐surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. 
Key results 
Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation 
The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. Three trials reported average follow‐up (range 29 months to 42 months). One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested.. 
In people eligible for surgery, there was no evidence of a difference in death between radiofrequency ablation and surgery; although there were fewer deaths due to cancer in the surgery group. There were more serious complications in the the surgery group than in the radiofrequency ablation group. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. 
Non‐surgical interventions 
The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. Eleven trials reported average follow‐up (range 6 months to 37 months). Trial participants, who were not eligible for surgery, were treated with radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation (cancer destruction using laser), microwave ablation (cancer destruction using microwaves), percutaneous acetic acid injection (cancer destruction using vinegar), percutaneous alcohol injection (cancer destruction using alcohol), a combination of radiofrequency ablation with systemic chemotherapy, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation (blocking the artery supplying the cancer with beads containing chemotherapy drugs) with percutaneous alcohol injection, or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with radiofrequency ablation. Five trials were funded by parties without any vested interest; the source of funding was not available in the remaining trials. 
In people not eligible for surgery, the percentage of people who died during the follow‐up period was higher in the percutaneous acetic acid injection and percutaneous alcohol injection groups than in the radiofrequency ablation group. There was no evidence of any difference in the percentage of people who died between any of the remaining comparisons. The percentage of people who died because of cancer was also higher in the percutaneous alcohol injection group than in the radiofrequency ablation group. There was no evidence of any difference in the percentage of people who died because of cancer between any of the remaining comparisons. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life at any time point. 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low or very low because of the way trials were conducted. Therefore, the conclusions made could overestimate the benefits or underestimate the harms of a given treatment. Further high‐quality RCTs are needed.
