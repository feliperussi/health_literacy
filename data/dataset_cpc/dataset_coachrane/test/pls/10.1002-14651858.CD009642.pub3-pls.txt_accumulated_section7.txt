Intravenous infusion of lidocaine starting at the time of surgery for reduction of pain and improvement of recovery after surgery 
Background 
The most common problems immediately following surgery under general anaesthesia are pain, nausea and vomiting, delirium and slow or no movement of food through the digestive system. Opioid medications given to reduce postoperative pain may also be associated with nausea and constipation, also preventing a smooth recovery. It is of interest for patients and clinicians to reduce or prevent these complications leading to an early recovery so that patients can leave hospital earlier. One option for pain relief after surgery is epidural analgesia, where an opioid or local anaesthetic such as lidocaine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord. Not all patients may be suited to epidural analgesia, and so additional options such as intravenous non‚Äêopioid analgesic medications that enable a rapid recovery are required. 
The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of intravenous infusion of lidocaine in patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Lidocaine is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. 
Study characteristics 
This review was published in 2015, and updated in 2017. We found 68 randomized controlled studies (RCTs), (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), with results from a total of 4525 participants. RCTs are used because they provide the most reliable evidence. 
Intravenous lidocaine was compared with placebo or standard care in 66 of the studies, and with thoracic (chest area of spine) epidural analgesia in two studies. (A placebo is an inactive substance or procedure given to a participant in a medical trial to compare its effects with those of a real drug or other intervention). Lidocaine infusion was started during the surgery, before the first cut, and continued to at least the end of surgery. The included studies were moderately well conducted.
