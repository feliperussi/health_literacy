Adrenaline and vasopressin for cardiac arrest
Review question 
Do the drugs adrenaline or vasopressin improve survival in cardiac arrest.
Background 
Cardiac arrest occurs when someone's heart unexpectedly stops beating. Without any treatment, death occurs within minutes. Treatments that are proven to work in cardiac arrest include cardiopulmonary resuscitation and giving an electric shock (defibrillation). If these treatments do not work, drugs such as adrenaline and vasopressin are injected (usually into a vein) to try to restart the heart. The early scientific evidence which led to their use came largely from small studies in animals. Whilst some human studies have shown that these drugs can help restart the heart initially, research also suggests they may have harmful effects on the brain.

Study Characteristics 
We identified 26 randomised controlled trials, involving 21,704 participants, that examined the effect of adrenaline or vasopressin on survival after cardiac arrest that occurred in and out of hospital and in adults and children. Some studies compared adrenaline in standard doses with placebo (dummy medication); some examined standard‐dose versus high‐dose adrenaline; and others compared vasopressin alone or vasopressin plus adrenaline to standard doses of adrenaline. 
Study funding sources 
The source of funding was not stated in 11 of the 26 studies. The study drugs were provided by the manufacturer in four of the 26 studies, but neither drug represents a profitable commercial option. The other 11 studies were funded by organisations such as research foundations and government funding bodies. 
Key results 
The studies found evidence that adrenaline was effective at restarting the heart and helping people recover enough to go home from hospital. However, there was no evidence that any of the drugs improved survival with a good neurological outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate (for studies comparing adrenaline to placebo), but mainly low or very low for the other comparisons, due to risks of bias within the studies. Many of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago. Treatment has changed in recent years, so the findings from older studies may not reflect current practice. The studies examined the drugs in many different situations (in and outside of hospitals, at different dosages, and in both adults and children), which may make combining findings misleading.
