Helium‐oxygen (heliox) treatment for children with croup
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether inhaling heliox is safe and useful in treating children with croup compared with fake treatment (placebo) or other therapies such as 30% humidified oxygen, or 100% oxygen with epinephrine (adrenaline, a drug that helps open airways). 
Background 
Croup is a short‐term illness that causes upper airways to be blocked. It is common in children aged between six months and three years, and is caused by viral infections; it is more frequent in autumn and winter. Symptoms include barking cough, hoarseness, abnormal breathing sounds, and chest wall retractions (inward movement of the skin of the chest wall or the breastbone during inhalation). 
Corticosteroid drugs are standard treatment for children with croup, but a limitation of this treatment is that it takes time for the drug to take effect. Children with severe croup may need additional emergency treatments such as a breathing tube or mechanical breathing support. Children with severe croup may need oxygen and adrenaline inhaled as a fine mist (nebulised). Adrenaline is generally safe, but can cause side effects such as fast heart rate and anxiety. Identifying a safe, effective, and fast‐acting treatment is important for children and their families. 
Heliox (a combination of helium and oxygen) gas may improve airflow and relieve breathing distress. Some studies have shown benefits from heliox for children with croup.

Study characteristics 
We did not include any new trials in this update.
We included 3 randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving a total of 91 children with croup aged from 6 months to 4 years. All studies were conducted in emergency departments. Studies took place with a duration of between 7 and 16 months; 2 studies were conducted in the USA, and 1 in Spain. In one study children with mild croup received either heliox or 30% oxygen; in another study children with moderate croup received oral dexamethasone (a type of corticosteroid) and either heliox or no treatment; and in the third study children with moderate to severe croup received injected dexamethasone and either heliox or 100% oxygen with adrenaline. 
Key results 
Given the very limited available evidence, uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may be no more effective than 30% oxygen for children with mild croup; as effective as 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline; and slightly more effective than no treatment for children with moderate croup. None of the studies reported adverse events (side effects).
