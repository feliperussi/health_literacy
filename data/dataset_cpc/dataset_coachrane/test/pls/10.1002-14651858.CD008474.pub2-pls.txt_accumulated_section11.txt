Ozone therapy as a treatment for foot ulcers in people with diabetes
What is diabetes and what is a foot ulcer? 
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common condition that leads to high sugar concentrations in the blood. People who have had diabetes for a long time often suffer from foot ulcers. Nearly 35% of all hospital admissions from diabetes clinics are due to them, as are nearly 80% of all non‚Äêtraumatic amputations of the leg and foot. 
What is ozone therapy? 
Ozone is a gas, and can be used as a treatment for ulcers in people with diabetes, which can be delivered with ozonised oils (e.g. ozonised sunflower or olive oil), or by a mixture of oxygen and ozone applied directly to the wound, or through rectal insufflation (blown into the final portion of the gut/intestines through the anus). 
The purpose of this review 
This review tried to find out whether ozone therapy is effective when given alone, or as part of a package of care, to treat foot ulcers in people with DM. 
Findings of this review 
The review authors searched the medical literature up to March 3 2015, and identified three relevant clinical trials (212 participants) that investigated ozone therapy for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. The available evidence was of low quality. 
One trial, with 101 participants, compared ozone treatment with antibiotics and followed up for 20 days. The results of this study showed that the reduction in ulcer size was greater, and also the length of hospital stay was shorter, in those receiving ozone treatment, but there was no apparent benefit in terms of the number of foot ulcers healed. No adverse effects (side effects or harms) were observed with either treatment. 
The other two trials (111 participants) compared ozone treatment plus usual care with usual care. The results of these two studies showed that there were no apparent differences between the groups for reduction in ulcer size,the number of foot ulcers healed, or occurrence of adverse events and amputation rates.
