Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people);
