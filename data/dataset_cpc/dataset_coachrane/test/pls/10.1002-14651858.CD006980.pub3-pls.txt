Neonatal vitamin A supplementation for prevention of mortality and morbidity among term neonates in low and middle income countries 
Review question: Does vitamin A supplementation among term neonates in low and middle income countries prevent mortality and morbidity? 
Background: Vitamin A is an important micronutrient that is required for maintenance of normal functioning of the human body. In the developing world, many pregnant women are vitamin A deficient. During pregnancy, additional vitamin A is required to promote growth of the baby and to provide stores in the baby's liver. Deficiency of this micronutrient in the mother may lead to its deficiency in the baby and may result in adverse effects on the baby's health. The benefits of giving vitamin A to children older than six months of age for reducing death and adverse effects on health have been established, but no available evidence shows this beneficial effect among infants one to five months of age. Potential benefits of vitamin A supplementation during the newborn period (during the first month of life) are under investigation. 
Study characteristics: The present review identified 12 studies including 168,460 newborns in which the intervention group was supplemented with vitamin A during the newborn period. 
Key results: Analysis of data for all infants shows no significant reduction in infant deaths at six months of age with the intervention and similar findings for infant deaths at 12 months of age. 
Quality of evidence: We judged the quality of evidence as high for the most important clinical outcomes, with the exception of two outcomes that we scored as having low and very low quality: ‘diarrhoeal events during the first 48‐72 hours post supplementation’ and ‘all‐cause infant mortality at 6 months in term infants’, respectively.
