Non‐drug interventions for sleepiness and sleep problems for shift workers who work nights 
Summary text 
People who work shifts, especially night shifts, often describe being sleepy at work or having sleep problems after work. This can be bad for their well‐being, safety, and health. On the basis of a systematic literature search, we evaluated whether person‐directed, non‐drug interventions can make shift workers less sleepy during their shift, and help them sleep longer and better after their shift is over. 
Studies found 
We found 17 randomised controlled trials (with 556 participants) to include in this review. We rated the quality of evidence provided by most of the included studies to be between low and very low. The studies could be divided into three different types of interventions: (1) exposure to bright light; (2) a napping opportunity during the night shift; or (3) others, like physical activity or sleep education. 
Key results 
Bright light 
Almost all of the bright light studies we looked at had some problem with the way they were designed. This problem made it difficult to know if any differences in sleepiness and sleep between those receiving bright light and those not receiving bright light were truly because of the bright light intervention. The studies were also too different in the types of bright light they used and types of light that the control groups received to compare them to one another. 
Napping 
The studies in the napping group did not report enough information for us to be certain whether napping helps shift workers feel more awake. The studies were very short, with each study lasting only a single night.
