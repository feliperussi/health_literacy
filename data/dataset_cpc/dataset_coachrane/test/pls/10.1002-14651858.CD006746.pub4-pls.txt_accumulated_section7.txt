What are the benefits and risks of laser peripheral iridoplasty (a surgical procedure) for chronic primary angle closure (an eye condition)? 
Why is this question important?  ‘Primary angle closure’ (PAC) is a condition in which the eye does not drain properly because the iris (the coloured part of the eye) blocks the drainage channel. A blockage can happen suddenly (acute PAC) or slowly (chronic PAC). A blockage causes a build‐up of fluid and raises pressure inside the eye, which damages the optic nerve and can lead to partial or complete vision loss. 
The main treatment for PAC is a surgical procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy. Peripheral iridotomy involves using a laser to create an opening in the iris so that fluid can drain out. For more than one in three people, however, peripheral iridotomy does not improve drainage. An alternative to peripheral iridotomy is laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIp), in which a laser is used to reshape the iris so that it does not block drainage. 
To find out how well LPIp works for people with chronic PAC, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?  First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared the effects of LPIp to other treatments or no treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?  We found four studies on a total of 252 people, mostly from Asia. The studies followed participants for between 3 and 12 months, and compared: 
‐ LPIp plus peripheral iridotomy to peripheral iridotomy alone, as a primary treatment (that is, in people who had not received any other treatment for PAC before);
