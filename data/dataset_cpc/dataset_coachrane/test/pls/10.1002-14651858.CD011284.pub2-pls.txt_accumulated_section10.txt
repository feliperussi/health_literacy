The impact of individual recovery expectations on pain, limitations in activities and return to work in low back pain 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out if positive recovery expectations of people with low back pain are related to their future pain, activities they are able to do and return to work. Are people who think they will recover from their low back pain more likely to get better? 
Key messages 
People with low back pain who have positive expectations of their own recovery are more likely to return to work and to recover from pain and increase the activities they are able to do. 
What was studied in this review? 
Low back pain is costly and causes a lot of disability. It is important to understand what characteristics of a person with low back pain are connected with how well they will recover (also known as their ‘prognosis’). People’s characteristics are often not changeable, including a characteristic like age. However, there is evidence that someone’s expectations of recovery may be changeable. If positive expectations are indeed connected to improved back pain outcomes then helping a person to have positive expectations of their own recovery may help them to recover. 
For this review, we examined three types of recovery expectations and their relation to back pain outcomes: general expectations of recovery (e.g. will your back pain last only a short time?), self‐efficacy expectations (e.g. do you believe you will be able to return to your normal activities?) and treatment expectations (e.g. will physiotherapy improve your back pain?). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We reviewed 4635 references and included 60 relevant studies. These studies included information about 30,530 people with low back pain. They looked at people's expectations of their own recovery and how that was related to their pain, limitations in activities and return to work one year after their back pain episode.
