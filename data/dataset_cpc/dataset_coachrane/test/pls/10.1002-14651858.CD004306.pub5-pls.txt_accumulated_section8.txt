Ways to help people stop using smokeless tobacco (including chewing tobacco, snuff and snus) 
Background 
Smokeless tobacco is any product in which tobacco is held in the mouth so that nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Smokeless tobacco is less dangerous than cigarettes and other products where tobacco is burnt and nicotine absorbed through the lungs. However, smokeless tobacco still leads to nicotine addiction and can be harmful, especially to the mouth. Many types of smokeless tobacco are used around the world, including chewing tobacco, snuff and snus. The risks to health vary with the type of product. 
Methods 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized trials about interventions to help people stop using smokeless tobacco, including nicotine replacement therapy, other pharmacotherapies and behavioural support. This evidence is current to June 2015. Trials had to report the number of participants who had stopped using smokeless tobacco or other products after six months. 
Results 
We found 34 relevant trials covering over 16,000 participants. All except one were conducted in the USA. Some studies in dental health clinics provided advice about oral health problems to smokeless tobacco users whether or not they were interested in stopping. Some studies recruited users who wanted to stop. 
Sixteen trials with 3,722 participants tested pharmacotherapies. Twelve studies tested different types of nicotine replacement therapy (five gum, two patch, five lozenge). The evidence suggests that the nicotine lozenge might help people quit, but the quality of evidence was low and more research is needed. There was not enough evidence to be sure whether nicotine gum or patches could help. Two trials of varenicline (a medication that helps smokers to quit) suggested it can also help people quit using smokeless tobacco.Two small trials of bupropion (an antidepressant that helps smokers to quit) did not find that bupropion helped people quit using smokeless tobacco.
