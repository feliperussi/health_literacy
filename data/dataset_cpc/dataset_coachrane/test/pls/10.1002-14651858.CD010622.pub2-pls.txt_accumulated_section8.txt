Recombinant human thyrotropin‐aided radioiodine treatment for non‐toxic multinodular goitre 
Background 
Goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland that can be classified as simple, diffuse goitre or multinodular goitre. Nodules (lumps) within the thyroid gland are common and usually benign. They are more frequent in women, the elderly, and in people who live in iodine‐deficient areas. Thyroid nodules may occur as a single nodule or as multiple nodules (multinodular). Multinodular goitre can be 'toxic' (producing too much thyroid hormone), or non‐toxic (normal thyroid function). Treatments for non‐toxic multinodular goitre include surgery, thyroid hormone suppressive therapy, and radioiodine therapy. Usually, higher amounts of radioiodine are needed to enable an appropriate radioiodine uptake in the thyroid nodules.  Genetically engineered recombinant human thyroid‐stimulating hormone (rhTSH) has been used to increase radioiodine uptake. 
We wanted to find out whether rhTSH‐aided radioiodine treatment is better for people with non‐toxic multinodular goitre compared with radioiodine treatment alone. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were health‐related quality of life, underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), side effects, reduction in thyroid volume, death from any cause, and costs. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with non‐toxic multinodular goitre;— compared rhTSH‐aided radioiodine treatment with radioiodine treatment alone;— tracked participants (follow‐up) for at least one year. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies that included a total of 321 participants. A single dose of radioiodine was administered 24 hours after the intramuscular injection of a single dose of rhTSH. Participants were followed up for 12 to 36 months.
