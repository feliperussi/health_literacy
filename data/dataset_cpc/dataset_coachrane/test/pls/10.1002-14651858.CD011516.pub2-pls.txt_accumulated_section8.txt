Assessment and support during early labour for improving birth outcomes
What is the issue? 
Progress in early labour may be slow. Women identify onset of labour from various signs including painful contractions and blood‐stained vaginal loss and may seek advice from health professionals about progress of their labour and for reassurance. Women may be advised to stay at home for as long as possible, or be sent home from hospital because their labour is not established. However, if progress in labour is more rapid than expected, delayed admission may result in an unplanned home birth. 
Why is this important? 
Women may feel anxious or distressed in early labour and lose confidence; this may slow progress and women may be less likely to experience a normal birth. In this review we evaluated whether assessment and providing support to women during early labour affected the duration of labour, the need for interventions and other outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched the medical literature (31 October 2016). We included five randomised controlled trials, involving 10,421 women from Canada, the USA, and the UK and a trial where maternity units were randomised in Scotland UK with 2183 women. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high for different outcomes. 
One trial (209 women) compared assessment with direct admission for women arriving at hospital. Women in the assessment group had shorter labours in hospital (low‐quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for caesarean or instrumental vaginal birth (i.e. forceps or ventouse) (very low quality evidence). Serious complications were not reported. Women in the assessment group were slightly less likely to have an epidural (low‐quality evidence), or labour augmentation with oxytocin, and had increased satisfaction with their care. No babies were born before admission to hospital. Admission to neonatal special care was not reported.
