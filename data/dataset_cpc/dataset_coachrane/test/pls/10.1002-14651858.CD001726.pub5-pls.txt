Beta2‐agonist drugs for treating cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis
Background 
Acute bronchitis is a chest infection, with cough and sometimes sputum production, chest pain and fever. People affected feel unwell and for those who do not have asthma or chronic lung disease there is no clear treatment. Viruses cause most cases of bronchitis, so antibiotics usually do not help. Beta2‐agonists (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are drugs that relieve asthma by relaxing muscles that cause narrowing in the passages to the lungs. They are sometimes used to relieve the cough in acute bronchitis, even in people who do not have asthma. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of beta2‐agonist drugs for children or adults with a cough from acute bronchitis, and with no other lung disease? 
Study characteristics 
Our searches are current to May 2015. We found no new trials. In previous searches, we found seven randomised controlled trials that used beta2‐agonist drugs for people with acute bronchitis. Two trials studied children aged one to 10 years (134 participants) and five were conducted in adults (418 participants). None of the studies reported receiving grants from drug‐making companies to conduct the study, but people who work for a drug maker were listed as authors on reports from two trials and study drugs were supplied free of charge by the company in three trials. 
Key results 
Daily cough scores were no different between children given oral beta2‐agonists and children in the placebo control groups. Daily cough scores, or the number of people still coughing after seven days, did not change in the adult trials either. 
However, the results were mixed. Some trials show a benefit and some show no benefit. This may be because some participants also had wheezing or other signs of narrowed airways, in which case beta2‐agonists may be helpful only for them. More of the adults taking beta2‐agonists had tremor, shakiness or nervousness. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated this as low or moderate. There were few trials, with small numbers of people with acute bronchitis or cough. The trials were of short duration (three to seven days) and only two used inhaled beta2‐agonists, which is now the usual way the drug is taken by adults and older children. Some important information about how the trial was done was not mentioned in the papers giving results for many of the trials.
