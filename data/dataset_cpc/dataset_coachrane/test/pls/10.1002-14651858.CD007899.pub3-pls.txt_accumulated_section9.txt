Paying for performance to improve the delivery of healthcare services in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of ‘pay for performance’ on the delivery of healthcare services in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 59 studies. 
Key messages 
The studies included in this review looked at pay for performance approaches that varied in their design, setting and implementation. The review shows that pay for performance may have both positive and negative effects on the health services it targets. It may also have positive effects on other health services that are not directly targeted and may have no unintended negative effects on these services. However, most of this evidence is of low certainty and we need more, well‐conducted studies on this topic. 
What is ‘pay for performance’? 
In a 'pay for performance' approach, people are given money or other rewards if they carry out a particular task or meet a particular target. Pay for performance is usually directed at health workers or healthcare facilities. The health workers or healthcare facilities are rewarded if they offer particular services or deliver care that is of a certain quality, or if their patients use particular services and achieve better health as a result. 
Pay for performance can be used  to target specific health problems and services that need improvement. But pay for performance could also affect other services that are not specifically targeted. For instance, it could lead health workers to improve the quality of the other services they deliver. But it could also lead them to avoid services that don’t lead to extra payment. To find out more, the review authors assessed the effects of paying for performance on both targeted and untargeted services. This included looking for any unintended effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 59 relevant studies. Most were from sub‐Saharan Africa and Asia. Most of the pay for performance schemes in the studies were funded by national Ministries of Health, also with support of the World Bank.
