Antibody induction therapy compared with corticosteroids for induction of immunosuppression after liver transplantation 
Background  Historically, corticosteroids have been the backbone of immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and corticosteroids are typically started immediately before or during transplantation. However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with several complications such as infection, hepatitis C virus recurrence, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, fracture, and reduced quality of life. Hence, corticosteroid avoidance and corticosteroid reduction regimens for liver transplant recipients have been developed. 
Antibodies against T‐cells are also used to induce immunosuppression after liver transplantation. This T‐cell specific antibody induction therapy is intended to reduce rejection of the transplanted liver and is given within the first two weeks after transplantation. Furthermore, these antibodies may allow for delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors to protect kidney function. 
Different types of T‐cell specific antibody induction therapy have been used for liver transplant recipients: interleukin‐2 receptor antagonists (BT563, daclizumab, or basiliximab), monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 receptor (muromonab‐CD3) or the CD52 surface protein (alemtuzumab), and polyclonal antibodies (rabbit or horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)). A novel approach has been to replace corticosteroids with T‐cell specific antibody induction as part of a corticosteroid reduction or avoidance regimen. The benefits and harms of this T‐cell specific antibody induction therapy remain unclear. 
Aim  We wanted to discover whether antibody induction therapy was better or worse than therapy with corticosteroids for induction of immunosuppression after liver transplantation. In specific, we wanted to establish the role of T‐cell specific antibody induction therapy as part of corticosteroid‐free immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and to find out which type of T‐cell specific antibody induction therapy works best with the fewest adverse effects. We systematically searched medical databases (date of last search September 2013) and found 10 randomised clinical trials with 1589 liver transplant recipients, which investigated the use of antibodies compared with corticosteroids for induction in 1589 participants after they had undergone liver transplant. These trials studied antithymocyte globulin and the interleukin‐2 receptor antagonists basiliximab and daclizumab. All of these trials had high risk of bias (i.e., risks of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms), which means that the quality of the evidence included in the review is low.
