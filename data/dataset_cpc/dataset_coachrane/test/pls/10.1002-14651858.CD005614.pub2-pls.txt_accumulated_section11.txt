Chondroitin for osteoarthritis
We conducted a review of the effects of chondroitin sulfate for people with osteoarthritis. We found 43 studies with 9,110 people after searching for studies up to November 2013. Majority were studies of knee osteoarthritis (few hand, one hip) ranging from 1 month to 3 years. Several studies were funded by makers of chondroitin. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis: 
‐ Chondroitin may improve pain slightly in the short‐term (less than 6 months);
‐ Chondroitin improves knee pain by 20% in slightly more people;
‐ Chondroitin probably improves quality of life slightly as measured by Lequesne's index (combined measure of pain, function, and disability); 
‐ Chondroitin has little or no difference in adverse and serious adverse events versus other agents; and 
‐ Chondroitin slightly slows down the narrowing of joint space on X‐rays of the affected joint. 
We identified a lot of studies in which unsound methods were used to assess the effects of chondroitin. For some outcomes, there was not enough data. In some studies, whose methodological quality was better, chondroitin showed no improvement in pain and in physical function. Other analyses based on different methodological quality criteria reported improvement in pain and physical functionality when chondroitin was given. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is chondroitin? 
Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage, but this bone growth may make the situation worse. This can make the joint painful and unstable, which can affect physical function or ability to use the joint.
