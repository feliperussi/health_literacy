Head bed elevation versus flat bed for preventing ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults requiring mechanical ventilation 
Background 
Adults who are critically ill often need a machine to help maintain their breathing. One side effect of these machines is an increased risk of pneumonia. This is known as ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). It is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients and can also increase the length of hospital stay and healthcare costs. The angle at which ventilated patients lie might play an important role in preventing the infection of their lungs. 
Review questions 
Head bed elevation by tilting the angle of the hospital bed might prevent the source of infection from getting into the lung. We assessed the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning for the prevention of VAP in critically ill adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We also investigated the best angle of head bed elevation in a semi‐recumbent position. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 10 studies involving 878 participants. Twenty‐eight participants were lost to follow‐up. The evidence is current up to 27 October 2015. All participants were recruited from intensive care units (ICUs) and received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Moderate quality evidence from eight studies involving 759 participants demonstrated that a semi‐recumbent (30º to 60º) position reduced clinically suspected VAP by 25.7% when compared to a 0° to 10° supine position. Based on this result, we would expect that out of 1000 critically ill adult patients who are nursed in the semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) for more than 48 hours, 145 patients would experience clinically suspected VAP compared to 402 patients nursed in the 0° to 10° supine position. There was no significant difference between the two positions in reducing microbiologically confirmed VAP (very low quality evidence), mortality (low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (moderate quality evidence), hospital stay (very low quality evidence), duration of ventilation or use of antibiotics. The main limitations of the evidence were the small numbers of participants contributing data to the analyses and that for some studies researchers would have known which treatment group participants were from (a risk of bias). 
Only two studies with 91 participants compared different degrees of bed head angle (45° versus 25° to 30° semi‐recumbent position). Very low quality evidence showed no statistically significant differences in the effects of VAP (clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed), mortality (ICU and hospital), length of ICU stay or use of antibiotics. Only one study reported the adverse event of pressure ulcers and did not find a difference between the 45° semi‐recumbent and 10° supine positions. No other adverse events, such as thromboembolism, or side effects on heart rate or blood pressure were reported. 
The balance of the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning still remains uncertain due to the limited numbers of studies and the low quality of the existing evidence. More high quality evidence is required on the effects of the semi‐recumbent versus supine position and the optimal body positions.
