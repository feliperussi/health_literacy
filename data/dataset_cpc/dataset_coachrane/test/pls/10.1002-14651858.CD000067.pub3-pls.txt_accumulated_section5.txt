Azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease?  Crohn's disease is a long‐term chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’. Periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What are azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine?  Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine are oral medications that reduce the body's immune responses and may reduce inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate?  The researchers investigated whether azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine maintains remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 30, 2015. 
What did the researchers find?  The researchers identified 11 studies that included a total of 881 participants. Seven studies including 532 participants compared azathioprine to a placebo (a fake medicine such as a sugar pill). Two studies including 166 participants compared azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine to aminosalicylates (the anti‐inflammatory medications mesalazine or sulfasalazine). One study including 77 participants compared azathioprine to budesonide (a steroid drug). One study including 31 participants compared 6‐mercaptopurine to methotrexate (an immunosuppressive drug). One study including 36 participants compared combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab (a biologic drug) to infliximab alone. One study with 147 participants compared the early use of azathioprine in patients with recently diagnosed Crohn's disease to a conventional management strategy. Two studies were rated as high quality. Three studies were rated as low quality. Six studies were rated as unclear quality due to a lack of information.
