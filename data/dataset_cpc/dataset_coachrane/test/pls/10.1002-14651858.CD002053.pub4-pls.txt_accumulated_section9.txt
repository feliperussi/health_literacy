Sedatives for opioid withdrawal in newborn infants
Review question 
To determine the effectiveness and safety of using a sedative (sleep‐inducing medicine) compared to a non‐opioid or a non‐medicine control for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to withdrawal from opioids. 
Background 
Use of opioids (prescribed or illicit) by pregnant women may result in their newborn infant experiencing withdrawal symptoms collectively referred to as NAS, which may result in disruption of the mother–infant relationship, sleeping and feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures (fits). Treatments for newborn infants used to ameliorate NAS and reduce complications include supportive treatments such as a dummy (pacifier); swaddling or close wrapping; small frequent feeds; close skin contact by carrying in sling and other methods; and prescription of opioids or sedatives, or both.

Key results 
We included 10 trials, enrolling 581 infants with NAS caused by maternal opioid use in pregnancy, in the review. There were multiple comparisons of different sedatives and regimens. The addition of phenobarbital to supportive care increased duration of hospitalisation and treatment, but reduced duration supportive care each day compared to supportive care alone. Phenobarbital reduced treatment failure compared to both diazepam and chlorpromazine. Clonidine and opioid compared to phenobarbital and opioid increased in days of hospitalisation and days of treatment. There were insufficient data to determine the safety and incidence of side effects for infants treated with combinations of opioids and sedatives including phenobarbital and clonidine. Side effects reported in infants treated with an opioid included oversedation from the addition of phenobarbital, and low blood pressure from the addition of clonidine with rebound high blood pressure and NAS reported after stopping clonidine. We found one ongoing study of clonidine plus morphine for NAS.
