Does hair removal before surgery prevent infections after surgery?
Key messages? 
Compared with no hair removal:
· there are probably more surgical site infections when hair is removed by shaving with a razor; 
· removing hair with clippers and cream may make little to no difference to the number of infections; 
Clippers and hair removal cream probably cause fewer infections than shaving using a razor. 
Removing hair on the day of, rather than the day before surgery may slightly reduce the number of infections. 
Why is hair removed before surgery? 
Before a surgical intervention, it is common to remove hair from the area of the body that is going to have surgery. Hair can be removed using different methods, including clippers, a razor, or hair removal cream. 
Hair is removed to avoid problems during and after surgery, for example when stitching up wounds or applying dressings. However, some studies claim that removing hair could cause infections after surgery and should be avoided. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if removing hair before surgery:
· causes or prevents infections;
· prevents wound complications, such as cuts to the skin or the opening up of stitched wounds; 
· has an impact on how long people stay in hospital after surgery; and
· has any cost implications.
We were also interested in whether some hair removal methods or times for hair removal are better than others. 
What did we do? 
First, we searched for studies that compared:
· hair removal against no removal; or
· different methods and times of hair removal.
We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.
