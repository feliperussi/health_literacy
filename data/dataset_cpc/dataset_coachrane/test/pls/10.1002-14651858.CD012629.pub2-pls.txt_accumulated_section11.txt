Intramuscular versus oral corticosteroids for acute asthma
Review question 
We examined the effectiveness of an injection of corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids taken by mouth to improve outcomes among patients who presented to an emergency department or similar acute care setting with acute asthma. 
Background 
Asthma attacks result from airway passages to the lungs becoming constricted due to inflammation, resulting in wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing. People experiencing asthma attacks often go to emergency departments. Corticosteroids, which are powerful anti‚Äêinflammatory agents, are the treatment cornerstone of asthma exacerbations, and have been shown to be effective in improving lung function and reducing hospitalisations in patients with asthma. At discharge, patients are commonly provided with corticosteroids to reduce the chance of returning to the emergency department due to worsening asthma symptoms. Corticosteroids may be provided via a single injection under the skin into the muscle ('intramuscular') or as tablets to take home, and it is currently unclear which regimen of corticosteroids is more effective at improving outcomes for patients following discharge from the emergency department.

Study characteristics 
We included nine studies that compared the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection compared to corticosteroid tablets in patients presenting to an ED or similar acute care setting with acute asthma. The studies enrolled a total of 804 paediatric and adult participants. Most studies investigated the injectable corticosteroids dexamethasone or methylprednisolone compared to the corticosteroid tablets prednisone or methylprednisolone. 
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not report sources of funding (5 studies). Two studies received funding from general health research grants. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company (Pfizer); however, reported that the company was not involved in any aspect of the study or manuscript preparation. One study reported being unfunded.
