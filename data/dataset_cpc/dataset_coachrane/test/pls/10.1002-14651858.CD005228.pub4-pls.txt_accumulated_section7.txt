Interventions for preventing nerve damage caused by cisplatin and other tumour‐inhibiting platinum drugs 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treatments to prevent or reduce damage to nerves from the anticancer (chemotherapy) drug cisplatin or other platinum‐containing drugs. 
Background 
Cisplatin and other related platinum‐containing drugs that are used to treat solid tumours are toxic to the peripheral nervous system. Most people who complete a full course of cisplatin chemotherapy develop a sensory neuropathy (damage to nerves that carry sensation). Symptoms can include tingling in the extremities and numbness. The neuropathy may only partially recover or not recover at all when the chemotherapy is stopped. To try to reduce the toxicity of platinum drugs, researchers have looked for therapies to protect the nerves. 
Study characteristics 
We carried out a wide search for studies of treatments to prevent this type of nerve damage. We identified a total of 29 clinical trials, which involved almost 3000 participants who were receiving platinum‐containing anticancer drugs (mostly cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) for various types of cancer (mainly colon, ovary, and lung cancers). The nine treatments studied were: amifostine (seven trials), calcium and magnesium (four trials), glutathione (seven trials), Org 2766 (four trials) and vitamin E (three trials). There was one trial each of acetylcysteine, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), oxcarbazepine, and retinoic acid. We chose an objective clinical test of sensation to report as our preferred measure of the effects of treatment. Only seven of the studies used this measure. Nine reported the results of nerve conduction studies which are another objective measure of nerve function. Most of the studies used a subjective assessment of neuropathy, such as the National Cancer Institute‐Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI‐CTC) neuropathy grading scale.
