Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD.
