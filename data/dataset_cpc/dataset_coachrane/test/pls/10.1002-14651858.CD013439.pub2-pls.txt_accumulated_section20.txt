How effective are dressings and topical agents in the management of wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks? 
Key messages 
‐ Platelet‐rich plasma (part of the participant's own blood that promotes tissue regeneration) may reduce time to wound healing compared with sterile gauze‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days compared with a dressing with iodine (which helps to reduce bacteria in the wound)‐ It is not clear whether hydrogel dressings (designed to keep the wound moist) reduce time to wound healing compared with wound cleaning with iodine 
What is pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks? 
Pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks is a common painful condition that mainly affects young adults. 
It occurs in the natal cleft (the groove between the buttocks). It begins as infected or inflamed hair follicles. A vacuum effect, created by the motion of the buttocks, may draw more hairs down into the inflamed area. Symptoms can be very painful and sometimes last for a long time. 
How is pilonidal sinus of the buttocks treated? 
The condition is often treated surgically, by cutting out the inflamed area containing the hair and debris, and in some cases the wounds are not closed by stitches but left open to heal naturally. A lot of dressings and topical agents (creams or lotions) are available to help these wounds heal. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see which dressings and topical agents are better for treating open wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks.   
For each intervention we looked at:
‐ how long it took wounds to heal;‐ the number of wounds healed after 30 days, 6 months and 1 year;‐ whether the wounds came back;‐ how long it took people who had been treated to return to normal daily activities;‐ quality of life;‐ value for money;‐ pain during the first dressing change;‐ harmful effects (for example surgical site infection or allergic reaction) after treatment. 
What did we do? 
We included participants of any age and either sex who had been treated in any care setting. We searched for studies where: 
‐ participants had been treated for pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks and were left with an open wound;‐ different dressings and topical agents were compared to see how effective they were for helping wounds to heal.  
What did we find? 
We included 11 studies with a combined total of 932 participants. Two studies compared topical negative pressure wound therapy (which applies controlled suction to the surface of the wound) with simple wound dressings. Two studies compared platelet‐rich plasma with sterile absorbent gauze. The other seven studies compared various dressings and topical agents. All the studies took place in hospitals. 
‐ No studies provided data on quality of life, value for money or pain at the first dressing change.‐ We do not know if topical negative pressure wound therapy helps wounds to heal faster than simple wound dressings.‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days.‐ We do not know if hydrogel dressings help wounds to heal faster or protect better against surgical site infection compared with wound cleaning with 10% povidone iodine.‐ Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce the time to wound healing compared with sterile absorbent gauze. ‐ Compared with placebo mesh, mesh with zinc oxide (which is thought to have healing properties) may have little or no effect on whether wounds heal by 30 days, and it is unclear if it reduces the time to wound healing.‐ We do not know if collagen sponge soaked in antibiotic has any effect on the time to wound healing compared with no dressing.‐ Dressings coated with dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (a substance that bacteria sticks to) may make little to no difference to wound healing time compared with alginate dressings (derived from seaweed).  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are not very confident in the evidence because there were only one or two studies in each comparison and most of the studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting.
