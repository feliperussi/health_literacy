Treatment for peripheral neuropathy associated with hepatitis C virus infection
Review question 
We wanted to assess the effects of any treatment for nerve damage that occurs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We planned to use the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
Background 
Peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerves outside the spinal cord. This may cause symptoms of altered sensation or weakness. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common nervous system complication of HCV infection. It is unclear how HCV‐related neuropathy arises. Sometimes HCV infection is associated with proteins in the blood called cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are proteins of the immune system that precipitate (become a solid) when the temperature of a blood sample is cooled below 37°C. Cryoglobulins can be measured in the blood of about 44% of people with HCV infection. The features of HCV neuropathy may differ in the presence versus the absence of cryoglobulins in the blood (called cryoglobulinemia). Treatment of HCV‐related neuropathy may differ depending upon how the nerve damage occurred, such as whether or not there is cryoglobulinemia. The best way to treat HCV‐related neuropathy has not been established. 
Study characteristics 
We found only four trials from this search of the literature. All four trials in this review included participants with peripheral neuropathy and HCV‐related cryoglobulinemia. There were no studies of HCV‐related non‐cryoglobulinemic peripheral neuropathy. Only one trial, in which there were results for 37 participants, reported effects on neuropathy. This study compared 48 weeks of rituximab and antiviral therapy versus antiviral therapy alone. Three trials, two of rituximab and one of interferon alfa (83 participants in total), reported adverse events. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
One trial of HCV‐related cryoglobulinemia treated with rituximab and antiviral therapy versus antiviral therapy alone did not demonstrate any significant difference in the number of participants with improvement in neuropathy at 36 months post treatment. Two studies of rituximab (61 participants) and one of interferon alfa (22 participants) provided information on adverse events. Severe adverse events were no more common with interferon alfa or rituximab compared to the control group. All four trials had problems with their design or implementation that could have affected the results. 
High‐quality studies of HCV‐related peripheral neuropathy treatment are lacking. There is not enough evidence to make evidence‐based decisions about treatment based on the results of this review. 
The evidence is current to August 2014.
