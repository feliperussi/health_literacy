Inserting an IUD right after abortion or miscarriage versus at a later time
Inserting an intrauterine device (IUD) right after an abortion or miscarriage can be good for many reasons. The woman is not pregnant and may be thinking about birth control, and the time and place are convenient for the woman. If asked to delay IUD insertion, many women do not return to get the device. However, the IUD might be more likely to come out on its own if put in right after abortion or miscarriage. This review looked at how safe it was to insert an IUD right after abortion or miscarriage. We also looked at whether the IUD stayed in. 
We did computer searches for randomised trials of IUDs inserted right after abortion or miscarriage. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare types of IUDs or times for insertion. We found 12 studies to include. 
Four trials randomised women to an IUD inserted right away or at a later time. One had no major difference. Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. A subanalysis showed more IUDs came out when inserted right after abortion or miscarriage rather than later. 
Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. The IUD was more likely to come out on its own when inserted after a mid‚Äêpregnancy abortion than after an earlier one. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often. 
Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical. However, the IUD is more likely to come out when inserted right away rather than at a later time. Women are more likely to use an IUD at six months if they had it inserted right away compared to some weeks after the abortion or miscarriage.
