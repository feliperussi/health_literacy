Renal denervation for improving outcomes in individuals with resistant hypertension
Key messages: 
We don’t know if using renal denervation can improve risks to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys in people with resistant hypertension.  
However, renal denervation might be effective in lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension.  
What is resistant hypertension? 
Resistant hypertension is a condition in which high blood pressure levels continue even after several blood pressure‐lowering (antihypertensive) medicines have been given at high doses. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of people with hypertension have resistant hypertension.  
What did we want to find out? 
Renal denervation is a treatment that involves destroying renal nerves through a minimally invasive catheter‐based technique to treat high blood pressure. We wanted to know if renal denervation would safely reduce blood pressure and improve quality of life in people with resistant hypertension. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared renal denervation to other treatments or no treatment for who have resistant hypertension. 
What did we find? 
We found 15 studies that involved over 1400 people with resistant hypertension and lasted from 3 to 24 months. 
Main results: 
So far, we don’t know if using renal denervation can improve risks to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys in people with resistant hypertension. On the other hand, renal denervation might be effective in lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension.  
What are the main limitations of the evidence? 
More studies that look at factors important to patients such as quality of life are needed. Studies that last longer and have more participants are needed to find out if denervation can lower blood pressure. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
The review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2020
