Corticosteroids including ACTH (adrenocorticotrophin hormone) for childhood epilepsy other than epileptic spasms 
Background 
We wanted to assess whether corticosteroids including ACTH are an effective treatment for children with epilepsy. Corticosteroids are sometimes used as an additional therapy to antiepileptic drugs in children with uncontrolled epilepsy. The role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy is yet to be established. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to August 2014. One study was included in this review. In total, data from five children, with uncontrolled seizures, aged between one and 11 years old were assessed. The duration of this study was two months; one month for the corticosteroid treatment and one month for the placebo (inactive) treatment. One of the five children was withdrawn from the study and another had epileptic spasms which meant we could not include their data in our analysis. Therefore, we were only able to compare data for three children. All three received both of the study treatments and the frequency of seizures they experienced while taking each treatment was compared. 
Key results 
One child showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with low dose corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. This child plus another child both showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with the higher dose of corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. A third child showed no reduction in seizures with either of the doses. As only one study was found which included data from three out of five participants, further statistical analysis was not possible. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy.
