Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and adverse effects of blood pressure‐lowering drugs (antihypertensive drugs) for pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure). The other aim was to assess the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs for their babies. 
Why is this important? 
During pregnancy, up to one in 10 women have blood pressure readings that are above normal. For some women, their blood pressure remains slightly high (termed ‘mild to moderate high blood pressure’), with no apparent complications. Some of these women go on to develop very high blood pressure. Very high blood pressure can result in a medical emergency if it affects the woman’s organs (such as her liver, or brain in the form of a stroke). Also, it can seriously affect the growth and health of her baby. 
Drugs that lower blood pressure are used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure, in the belief that this treatment will prevent the blood pressure from continuing to rise. Over the years, information from good quality research studies has been contradictory, so we cannot be sure if this drug treatment is worthwhile. 
What evidence did we find? 
This Cochrane Review is an update of a review that was first published in 2001 and updated in 2007 and 2014. We searched for randomised controlled trials in September 2017, and this review now includes data from 58 trials involving more than 5900 women. A total of 31 trials with 3485 women compared a number of different blood pressure‐lowering drugs to a placebo or no treatment. There were a further 29 trials involving 2774 women which compared one blood pressure‐lowering drug with another one.
