Vitamin D supplementation for term breastfed infants to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health 
Review question: do vitamin D supplements for breastfed infants or their mothers prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health? 
Background: vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide with infants at higher risk due to pigmentation, covering, avoidance of sun exposure or the latitude of where they live. Vitamin D is important for bone health, helping prevent nutritional rickets and fractures. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of low vitamin D levels. 
Study characteristics: evidence is up‐to‐date as of May 2020. We identified 19 studies with 2837 mother‐infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to breastfeeding mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus breastfeeding mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. 
Key results: for breastfed infants, vitamin D supplements may increase vitamin D levels and reduce the incidence of mildly low vitamin D levels, but there was insufficient information to determine if there was a reduction in vitamin D deficiency or in signs of poor bone health (low bone mineral content, nutritional rickets or fractures). For breastfed infants at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation for the mother may increase infant vitamin D levels and may prevent vitamin D deficiency. There was not enough information to determine if there are benefits for bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants may be better than vitamin D supplementation of the mother whilst breastfeeding for preventing vitamin D deficiency. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. High‐dose maternal supplementation (≥ 4000 IU per day) achieved similar infant vitamin D levels as infant supplementation with 400 IU per day.
