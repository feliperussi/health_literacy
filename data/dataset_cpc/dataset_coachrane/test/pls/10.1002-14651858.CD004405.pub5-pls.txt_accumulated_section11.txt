Corticosteroids for bacterial meningitis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of corticosteroids on mortality, hearing loss and/or neurological sequelae (such as hearing loss, neurologic deficits) in adults and children with acute bacterial meningitis. 
Background 
Acute bacterial meningitis is an infection of the meninges (the system of membranes that envelops the brain and spinal cord), which often causes hearing loss. Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of children and 20% to 50% of adults despite treatment with adequate antibiotics. It is caused by bacteria that usually spread from an ear or respiratory infection and is treated with antibiotics. 
Corticosteroids are drugs that can reduce the inflammation caused by infection. This inflammation has been shown to aggravate damage to the nervous system in experimental meningitis studies in animals. Research on the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics has had conflicting results. 
We wanted to discover whether use of corticosteroids was better of worse than placebo.
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to February 2015. We identified 25 trials, including 4121 participants with acute bacterial meningitis of which seven were performed in adults (over 16 years old), two included both children and adults and the other were performed in children. In 22 studies the corticosteroid used was dexamethasone, in three others hydrocortisone or prednisone were used. Nine studies were performed in low‐income countries and 16 in high‐income countries. 
Key results 
This review found that the corticosteroid dexamethasone did not significantly reduce the death rate (17.8% versus 19.9%). Patients treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower rates of severe hearing loss (6.0% versus 9.3%), any hearing loss (13.8% versus 19.0%) and neurological sequelae (17.9% versus 21.6%).
