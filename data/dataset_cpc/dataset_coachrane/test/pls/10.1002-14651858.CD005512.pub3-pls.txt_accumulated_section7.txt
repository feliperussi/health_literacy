Preformed crowns for managing decayed primary molar teeth in children
Background 
To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre‚Äêmade (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment. 
Review question 
This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them.
