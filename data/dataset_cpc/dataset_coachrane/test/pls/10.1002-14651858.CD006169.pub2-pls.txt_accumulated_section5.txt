Combinations of tocolytic drugs for inhibiting preterm labour
Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) is the single largest cause of deaths and ill health for newborn babies and a major cause of complications for pregnant women. Tocolytic agents include a wide range of drugs that can slow or stop labour contractions so as to prolong pregnancy and potentially improve the health outcomes for the baby. Using a combination of two or more tocolytic drugs may improve the length of time the pregnancy is prolonged over using a single tocolytic drug or no intervention, without adversely affecting the mother or baby or worsening drug side effects. 
This review examined the effects of any combination of tocolytic drugs for the treatment of preterm labour, compared with any other treatment, no treatment or placebo. The results of the review are based on data from nine randomised controlled trials that examined seven different drug comparisons. 
Three trials examined the betamimetic drug ritodrine plus magnesium compared with ritodrine alone. The trials reported on adverse side effects, with inconsistency between the trials as to which treatment gave fewer severe side effects. Other outcomes were either not reported or not clearly different between treatment groups. 
One trial looked at ritodrine plus indomethacin versus ritodrine alone. There were no clear differences between groups for serious newborn ill health. Results for other outcomes were not clearly different. There were no clear differences between groups receiving ritodrine plus progesterone compared with ritodrine alone for most outcomes reported, although the time between giving the drugs and the birth was increased in the group receiving the combination of tocolytics. For other combinations of tocolytic agents, results did not demonstrate differences between groups. There were no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents, such as calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban).
