Government regulation of private health insurance
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of government regulations of private health insurance. The review authors searched for all relevant studies to answer this question. 
Key messages 
We do not know what the effect of government regulations on private health insurance is as the evidence was of very low certainty. We need more studies from different settings, assessing different types of regulations, and different types of private health insurance. 
What was studied in the review? 
In many settings, people have to pay for their own health care. This means that people with small incomes are often not able to afford the health care they need. To solve this problem, some governments run public health insurance programmes. Governments usually pay for these programmes through taxes, but these programmes are complicated and expensive to run. Some governments therefore also rely on private health insurance companies to get people the health care they need. 
Membership in a private health insurance scheme is paid for directly by the individuals themselves or by their employers. Private health insurance companies are sometimes run for profit and are sometimes non‐profit. But most companies are likely to prefer members who are young and healthy as they need less health care. Governments therefore try to regulate these companies to make sure that anyone can join and that the health care on offer is of good quality. Governments do this by establishing laws that companies have to follow, by monitoring whether companies follow them and by punishing those who do not. Government regulations can increase people’s access to health care and save the government money. But regulations can also lead insurance companies to shut down. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review authors found seven relevant studies. All of the studies looked at the effect of state laws that aimed to regulate for‐profit companies in the USA.
