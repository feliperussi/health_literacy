Medications for the management of opium withdrawal
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which medications are more effective and safer for the management of opium withdrawal. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question, and found 13 studies involving 1096 participants. 
Key messages 
This review included the following 12 comparisons: baclofen versus clonidine, clonidine versus clonidine plus amantadine, clonidine versus buprenorphine, high‐dose clonidine versus low‐dose clonidine versus symptomatic management, clonidine versus methadone, methadone versus tramadol, methadone versus methadone plus gabapentin, gradual reduction of methadone versus sudden withdrawal of methadone, methadone plus amitriptyline versus methadone, diphenoxylate versus propoxyphene, three different protocols of tincture of opium, and tincture of opium versus methadone. The studies were carried out in three countries, Iran, India, and Thailand. Support from a pharmaceutical company in the form of free provision of medications was reported in only one study. 
The evidence is unclear as to whether any of the evaluated medications is more effective than another in the management of opium withdrawal. However, it seems that opium withdrawal symptoms are significant in the first days after discontinuation of opium. All of the assessed medications might be useful in alleviating symptoms. Use of clonidine might result in low blood pressure. 
What was studied in this review? 
Withdrawal symptoms from opium are similar to those of other opioids such as heroin, but with mild intensity. Patients usually need medications to help alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We are uncertain as to whether the effects of clonidine differ from those of baclofen in number of participants who completed treatment (certainty of evidence was very low).
