Is limiting the amount of fluid given to adults during surgery as good as using haemodynamic monitoring, which continuously measures changes in blood pressure or speed of blood flow inside the arteries, to guide fluid administration? 
Review question 
Our objective was to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether limiting the amount of fluid given to adults during surgery is as good as using haemodynamic monitoring to guide fluid administration. RCTs are clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. Haemodynamic monitoring is continuous, beat‐to‐beat measurement of changes in blood pressure or speed of blood flow inside the arteries. 
Background 
During operations, adults receive additional fluids into their veins (intravenously) to cover their normal needs for fluid and to supplement any fluids lost during surgery because of bleeding, or for other reasons, for example, increased perspiration. It still is not clearly understood how much fluid should be given to adults during surgery. In the past, a lot of fluid was given during operations because it was thought that a large amount of fluid vaporizes during surgery from open cavities, lungs, and skin, and that a lot of fluid is accumulated in operated tissues, and because people require a long fasting time before surgery. Many new studies have disputed these findings, and recently, techniques that use haemodynamic monitoring have been developed to guide doctors on how much fluid is actually necessary during surgery. This technique is called goal‐directed fluid therapy (GDFT). Another concept is that simply giving less fluid than was recommended in the past may confer the same benefit. This technique is called restrictive fluid therapy (RFT). RFT is cheaper and easier to use because it does not require additional equipment. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 11 October 2019. We included studies that randomly assigned adults to intervention groups comparing the two techniques described above. We found six studies including a total of 562 participants. Five studies involved abdominal surgery, and one involved orthopaedic surgery. No studies involved emergency surgery nor patients suffering from serious medical conditions before surgery. 
Key results 
The number of deaths was slightly lower in the GDFT group compared with the RFT group, but this may be due to chance. No difference in the frequency of major complications was observed between the two groups. In addition, no differences were observed between RFT and GDFT groups in the following outcomes: length of hospital stay, surgery‐related complications (related directly to the operation site, e.g. problems with wound healing), non‐surgery‐related complications (related to problems with other organs, e.g. heart or lungs), renal failure, and quality of surgical recovery. 
Certainty of evidence 
We judged the certainty of evidence obtained for this review as very low because conclusions are based on very small numbers of participants in included studies, the quality of included studies is low, and studies were performed only on selected groups of patients that did not reflect the real population of people undergoing surgery. This means that new studies are very likely to change the results of this review. The review does not answer the question of whether results would be the same for adults who have other serious health problems before surgery, or for adults undergoing other types of surgery besides abdominal surgery and orthopaedic surgery.
