Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery.
