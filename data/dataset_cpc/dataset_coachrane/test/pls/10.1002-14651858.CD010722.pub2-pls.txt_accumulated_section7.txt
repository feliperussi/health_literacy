Transcranial colour Doppler (TCD) and transcranial colour‐coded duplex (TCCD), in patients with acute ischaemic stroke for detecting intracranial vessel occlusion or stenosis 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out how accurate two imaging techniques ‐ transcranial colour Doppler (TCD) and transcranial colour‐coded duplex (TCCD) ‐ are for detecting a blockage of the arteries in the brain in the first hours after a stroke and whether they can be used to select patients who may need to receive more invasive and expensive imaging methods such as intra‐arterial angiography (IA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). There is currently no agreement on the use of TCD and TCCD in the management of people with acute stroke, and the use of TCD and TCCD varies between and within countries. 
Key messages 
TCD and TCCD may provide clinically helpful information for detecting a blockage of arteries in the brain when compared with IA, CTA, and MRA. 
What was studied in the review? 
Ischaemic stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long‐term disability. It is usually caused by a blockage of the blood supply to one part of the brain. When stroke is caused by a blockage of a large artery due to a blood clot, the prognosis, without treatment, is often poor and can lead to severe disability. Curently, there are two effective treatment options that can be used to dissolve the blood clot: to administer a thrombolytic drug, or to physically extract the blood clot from the artery (mechanical thrombectomy). Both treatments work best within the first few hours of stroke onset. Ultrasound scans (TCD and TCCD) are a quick and simple way to detect the blockage of blood vessels in the brain. We reviewed the current literature for clinical studies assessing the accuracy of these diagnostic techniques compared with IA, CTA, and MRA for the detection of blocked blood vessels in the brain in people with symptoms of ischaemic stroke.
