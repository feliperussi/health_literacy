Do local anaesthetic nerve blocks provide effective pain relief for adults with a hip fracture? 
What is a peripheral nerve block? 
A peripheral nerve block (PNB) is an injection of local anaesthetic close to nerves to block pain signals to the brain. PNBs can be used alone or together with other pain relief medicines. They may be given as a single injection or continuously, using a catheter (drip).  
Why is this question important? 
Hip fractures commonly occur in older people. Surgery is usually needed to repair the bone. Hip fractures are very painful. Opioids such as morphine, which are strong painkillers, are often used to manage hip fracture pain. Older people do not tolerate high doses of opioids well. Also, people with hip fracture may have complications such as confusion, myocardial infarction and chest infection.  
By reducing the use of opioids and better treating pain, PNBs may improve the mobility of people with hip fracture and reduce risks of complications.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether using PNBs compared to no nerve block (no block at all or a placebo nerve block), in people with hip fracture could reduce: 
• pain on movement;
• confusion, myocardial infarction, and chest infection;
• death from any cause within six months;
• length of time until people were mobile after surgery; and
• costs of drugs used to manage pain.
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that investigated the use of PNBs versus no effective nerve block (i.e. no block at all or a placebo block) for pain in people with hip fracture. Study participants had to be over 16 years of age and had to have a hip fracture. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where the treatment people receive is decided randomly.  
What we found 
We included 49 studies with 3061 participants (average age 59 to 89 years); 1553 participants received PNBs and 1508 received no nerve block. Additional pain relief, including opioids, was available for all participants when required. Studies were conducted in various countries and published between 1980 and 2020. Twenty‐six studies received non‐commercial funding, and the source of funding was not stated for the other studies.
