Short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders
Background 
Common mental disorders include anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, stress‐related physical conditions, certain behaviour disorders and personality disorders. People with these disorders tend to have problems handling difficult emotions and often respond with physical and psychic symptoms or avoidant behavioural patterns. Such patterns and emotional responses are theoretically treatable by short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) because these therapies aim to improve long‐ and short‐term problems with emotion processing, behaviour and communication/relationships with others. STPP is thought to work by making people aware of emotions, thoughts and problems with communication/relationships that are related to past and recent trauma. This in turn helps to correct problems with emotions and relationships with others. 
This review sought to find out whether STPP is more effective than wait‐list control (where people receive therapy after a delay during which people in the 'active' group receive the therapy), treatment as usual and minimal treatment (partial treatments not expected to provide a robust effect). 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of STPP compared with wait‐list control, treatment as usual or minimal treatment up to July 2012. We searched for studies in adults over 17 years of age with common mental disorders being treated in an outpatient setting. We excluded people with psychotic disorders. 
Key results 
We included 33 studies involving 2173 people. When the results of the studies were combined and analysed, we found that there was a significantly greater improvement in the groups of people who received STPP versus the control groups, both in the short‐term (less than three months after treatment) and medium‐term (three to six months after treatment). These benefits generally appeared to increase in the long‐term. However, some results did not remain statistically significant in the long‐term and, in addition, the studies varied in terms of their design, meaning that these conclusions are tentative and need confirmation with further research. The finding that a short‐term psychological therapy treatment may be broadly applicable and effective is of importance in the atmosphere of current global healthcare and economic restrictions.
