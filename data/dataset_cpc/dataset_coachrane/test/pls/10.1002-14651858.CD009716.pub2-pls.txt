Use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet drugs for preventing early recurrence after stroke or transient ischaemic attack 
Review question 
Are multiple antiplatelet drugs better than fewer antiplatelet drugs for preventing early recurrence after stroke? 
Background 
Stroke is the second most common non‐communicable disease in the world, and carries a high risk of recurrence. Most recurrences occur early after stroke, and effective treatments are needed to prevent recurrence. Current guidelines recommend the use of an antiplatelet drug like aspirin after a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (mini‐stroke). However, the safety and benefit of using more than one antiplatelet drug early after stroke has not been clearly established. 
Study characteristics 
We compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet drugs early after stroke. The evidence is current to 6 July 2020. We included 15 clinical trials with a total of 17,091 participants from a range of Asian, European and North American populations. The most common antiplatelet combinations tested were aspirin and dipyridamole, and aspirin and clopidogrel. 
Key results 
We found that multiple antiplatelet drugs reduced the risk of stroke recurrence but increased the risk of bleeding compared with fewer antiplatelet drugs. Two antiplatelet drugs appear to be more effective in preventing early stroke recurrence than a single antiplatelet drug, but there is an increased risk of side effects, especially bleeding. The benefits of dual antiplatelet drugs started immediately after a stroke seems to outweigh the risks for the first month. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence was generally moderate or high.
