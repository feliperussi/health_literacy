Identifying carrier status for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease in non‐pregnant women and their partners 
Review question 
We looked for evidence to show whether identifying people who are carriers for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease, before pregnancy leads to improving reproductive choice and pregnancy outcomes. 
Background 
Across the world, about 6% of children are born with a birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin.  Many of these conditions can be passed down from parent to child. There are tests to identify the genetic risk of the most common genetic conditions (thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease) before pregnancy. In these conditions, called autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of affected children are 'carriers' of the condition, which means they do not usually have symptoms. All 'carrier' couples will have a 25% chance of having an affected child. Risk assessment for these genetic conditions before getting pregnant would benefit potential parents who may be carriers. This information would give the at‐risk couple the opportunity to make fully informed decisions about family planning. However, genetic risk assessment before pregnancy may potentially have a negative psychological impact. This is an updated version of the original review.

Study characteristics 
We did not find any trials that we could include in this review. In an earlier version of this review, we had already found the protocol for a trial that has now published its results, but we have excluded the trial in this version of the review because it did not look at the right topic after all.
