Expectant care (waiting) versus surgical treatment for miscarriage
Miscarriage is pregnancy failure before 14 weeks, which is common in early pregnancy. Such a loss in early pregnancy can affect a womanâ€™s physical and mental health. Doctors often suggest surgery such as dilation and curettage (D and C) or vacuum aspiration to complete the process. Surgery might cause problems such as trauma, heavy bleeding, or infection. Expectant management means waiting for the miscarriage to finish on its own, and may involve bed rest, examination by ultrasound, and antibiotics. This review looked at whether expectant management works as well as surgery for miscarriage. 
We searched for randomized trials that compared waiting versus surgery for miscarriage. In addition, we looked at reference lists to find trials. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. Seven trials with 1521 women looked at waiting versus surgery for miscarriage. More women who waited for the miscarriage to complete on its own had tissue left in the womb. This was studied at two weeks and at six to eight weeks. More of these women needed surgery to complete the process. These women also had more days of bleeding. Some needed to be given blood, compared with none in the surgery group. Both groups had about the same numbers of infections. Results were mixed for pain. Mental health also seemed about the same for both treatment groups. Costs were lower for waiting than for surgery. Overall, no strong medical results argue for either approach. Information was limited on future pregnancy. One trial was large, while the others had small numbers of women. What the woman prefers should be the major concern. Drug treatment (such as with misoprostol and mifepristone) has added choices for women and their clinicians, and has been studied in other reviews.
