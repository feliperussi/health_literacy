Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated).
