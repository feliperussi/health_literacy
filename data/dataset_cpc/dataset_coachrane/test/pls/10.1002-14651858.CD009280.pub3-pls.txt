Drugs for reducing iron in people with acute stroke
Background 
Brain damage after stroke is complex, and consists of both direct and delayed damage. A disturbance in local iron levels may be linked to delayed brain damage. Therefore, limiting iron toxicity is a potential target in the treatment of people with stroke. Iron‐chelating drugs are able to bind excess iron in blood and in local tissue, and may reduce iron accumulation and iron‐related brain injury. In animal studies, iron‐chelating drugs have been shown to protect brain cells after occurrence of stroke.

Study characteristics 
We identified two trials, with 333 participants in total, which investigated the effectiveness on good clinical outcome of iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine for acute stroke. Both trials studied the effect in people who had bleeding in the brain, a subset of acute stroke. 
Key results 
With the limitation that studies could not be pooled, the data did not show any difference in good neurological outcome between groups. Both studies reported that administration of deferoxamine was safe. Oedema formation around the haematoma was slightly reduced in the deferoxamine group in one study, but not in the other. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence for the use of deferoxamine for the improvement of neurological outcome in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage is low. This is based on two small studies with short follow‐up, and with differences in outcome measurement. Limited evidence was available regarding side effects. The added value of iron‐chelating therapy in people with ischaemic stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage remains unknown.
