Non‐surgical treatment versus surgical treatment for oesophageal (gullet or food‐pipe) cancer 
Review question 
Is non‐surgical treatment equivalent to surgical treatment for treatment of people with oesophageal cancer (cancer of the gullet or food pipe)? 
Background 
Oesophageal cancer is the sixth most frequent cause of cancer‐related death in the world and is becoming more common. Treatment and survival depends upon the extent of cancer. When the cancer is limited to the gullet and the person is fit to undergo major surgery, surgical removal of the oesophagus (oesophagectomy) is currently the recommended treatment. Additional chemotherapy (use of chemicals to selectively destroy cancer) and radiotherapy (use of X‐rays to destroy cancer) may be given in addition to surgery in some people with oesophageal cancer. However chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of the two (chemoradiotherapy) can be used alone without surgery but are currently only recommended in people who are unfit for major surgery because of their general condition. Chemoradiotherapy on its own may cause such side effects as severe kidney damage, infection, and vomiting, but is less invasive than oesophagectomy, and may result in a shorter hospital stay and reduced risk of death. Oesophagectomy may carry the significant potential side effects of surgical site infection, the narrowing and breakdown of tissue where the cut end of the oesophagus is joined to the bowel, pneumonia, and difficulty swallowing. The death rate may also be higher, particularly when performed in smaller centres. It is unclear whether non‐surgical treatment may be as effective as surgery in cure of cancer.
