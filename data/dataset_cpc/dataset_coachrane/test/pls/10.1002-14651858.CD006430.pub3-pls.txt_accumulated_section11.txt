Occupational therapy for cognitive impairment in people who have had a stroke
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if occupational therapy improves function in everyday activities and cognition after a stroke. Cognition is the information‐processing carried out by the brain such as thinking, paying attention to things you see or hear, learning, remembering, and solving problems. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 24 studies. 
Key messages 
For people with cognition problems after a stroke, occupational therapy may make little to no meaningful difference in the person's ability to do self‐care activities, such as showering and dressing, immediately after occupational therapy and six months later. Occupational therapy may improve these people's general information‐processing skills and ability to pay attention while looking at something, immediately after the intervention. Occupational therapy may slightly improve some aspects of memory and ability to think flexibly. 
The quality of the evidence means that our findings are mostly of low or very low certainty. More well‐designed studies that test occupational therapy interventions for cognitive impairment after a stroke are needed. 
What did the review study? 
Problems with cognition are common after stroke and can affect a person's ability to do everyday self‐care activities such as dressing, feeding, and showering, as well as activities in the home or community, such as housework or grocery shopping.  
People who have had a stroke can receive a range of therapies after a stroke in hospital, a rehabilitation centre, or in their home. Occupational therapy is one of these therapies. Occupational therapists work with people who have problems with cognition after a stroke to assist them to become as independent as possible. They do this by teaching people ways to adapt to or compensate for the problems, or with training activities to improve cognition (such as memory training), or a combination of these. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review authors found 24 relevant studies from 11 countries. These studies compared occupational therapy with a control group that received usual rehabilitation care for people with problems in cognition following stroke. In most studies, the occupational therapy intervention involved training using a computer that had specially designed games to improve cognition. Some interventions involved training in daily activities, such as dressing.
