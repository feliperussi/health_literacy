How accurate are screening tests in identifying those at risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of primary angle closure glaucoma important?Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. If untreated, glaucoma can lead to blindness. Primary angle closure glaucoma is a type of glaucoma, where the drainage route for the fluid inside the eye (known as the angle) is narrowed or blocked, leading to raised eye pressure and loss of the field of vision. Primary angle closure glaucoma accounts for a quarter of all cases of glaucoma globally and it is more likely to lead to vision loss than the more common form, primary open angle glaucoma. 
A variety of non‐invasive tests are available to identify people at risk of primary angle closure glaucoma in a community or non‐specialist clinical setting. Those who test positive are referred for further specialist investigation and possible treatment. Failure to detect this condition (a false negative result) may result in an increased risk of progressive optic nerve damage and blindness. An incorrect diagnosis (a false positive result) could lead to unnecessary and costly investigation. 
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this review was to find out how accurate non‐invasive screening tests are in identifying those at risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma. 
What was studied in this review? Five non‐invasive tests were studied. These range from simple tests that require either a pen torch or a widely available piece of clinical equipment known as a slit ‐lamp microscope (oblique flashlight test; limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD)) to more sophisticated imaging equipment (anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS‐OCT), Scheimpflug photography and scanning peripheral anterior chamber depth analyser (SPAC)) that can scan and measure the dimensions of the drainage angle.
