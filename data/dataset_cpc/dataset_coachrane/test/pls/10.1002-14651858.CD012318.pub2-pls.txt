Radial artery versus femoral artery approach for performing coronary catheter procedures in people with coronary artery disease 
Review question 
Should physicians introduce the catheter (a long, thin tube) through the femoral artery (transfemoral access via the groin) or the radial artery (transradial access via the wrist) to reach the coronary arteries (blood vessels supplying the heart) for the diagnosis or treatment of coronary artery disease? 
Background 
Coronary artery disease contributes to half of deaths caused by cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) disease. Restoration of adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries can be achieved by introducing a catheter through a peripheral artery. This allows the introduction of balloons through the aorta (major artery of the heart) to dilate coronary artery narrowing or place arterial scaffolds (tubes called stents) to keep the coronary arteries open. Two main peripheral arteries can provide access; traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (one of two major arteries in the forearm). While gaining popularity, the transradial approach can be more challenging than the transfemoral approach, which may translate to longer procedural durations and technical failures. In addition, this raises concerns regarding radiation exposure to patients and physicians being higher with the transradial approach. We sought to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to help inform healthcare decisions. 
Study characteristics 
Our search yielded 31 eligible studies comparing the transradial approach to the transfemoral approach in people undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic (or both) coronary catheterisation procedures in different settings, whether urgent (during heart attacks (myocardial infarctions)) or elective (planned procedure). The trials were carried out in many countries and regions, including Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and USA. We also identified two ongoing studies. The evidence was current to October 2017. 
Key results 
Transradial access was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome (comprising two or more combined outcomes) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (injury of the heart muscle), stroke (insult to the brain), need to reintervene on the same site of coronary artery stenosis (narrowing), and bleeding during the first 30 days following intervention. When assessing individual outcomes, the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was similar between groups. Transradial access reduced death from cardiac causes, death from all causes during the first 30 days following intervention, bleeding, and local complications at the access site. The transradial approach shortened the length of stay in hospital, but was associated with a higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring an alternate vascular access route. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence for short‐term myocardial infarction and all‐cause death as high. We rated short‐term NACE, cardiac death, and success of the procedure as moderate quality evidence. Evidence for bleeding and access site complications was low quality.
