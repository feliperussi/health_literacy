Chinese herbal medicines for unexplained recurrent miscarriage
Recurrent miscarriage has been defined as two, three, or more consecutive spontaneous miscarriages in early pregnancy, and affects a small number (1% to 3%) of women of reproductive age. Many pregnant women may not recognise a miscarriage until they experience uterine bleeding and cramping after the 10th week of pregnancy. There are risks of repeat miscarriages after the first pregnancy loss and the chance of having a successful pregnancy varies. Some recurrent miscarriages have underlying causes, including both maternal and fetal factors; specific treatments targeting these causes are effective. However, the underlying causes may not be identified and most recurrent miscarriage are unexplained. There is no universal recommendation for the treatment of unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Chinese herbal medicines have been widely used in Asian countries for centuries and have become a popular alternative therapy in Western countries in recent years. Many clinical studies have reported that Chinese herbal medicines can improve pregnancy and live birth rates by preventing miscarriage and promoting the continuation of pregnancy. 
Different Chinese herbal medicine formulae (Shou Tai Pill, Yangxi Zaitai Decoction, Bushen Antai Decoction and some modified formulae) were used in the trials. The basic formula mostly contained some common Chinese herbal medicines (Chinese Dodder Seed, Chinese Taxillus Twig, Himalayan Teasel Root, Largehead Atractylodes Rhizome, Donkey‚Äêhide Glue, Eucommia Bark, Tangerine Peel, Szechwon Tangshen Root, White Paeony Root, Baical Skullcap Root, Mongolian Milkvetch Root, Chinese Angelica, etc). Western pharmaceutical medicines included tocolytic drugs such as salbutamol and magnesium sulphate, hormonal supplementation with human chorionic gonadotrophin, progesterone or dydrogesterone, and supportive supplements such as vitamin E, vitamin K and folic acid. 
We searched for evidence on 1 June 2015 and found nine trials (861 women) to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. All trials were methodologically poor and at an unclear risk of bias overall. No trial used placebo, no treatment or bed rest as a control intervention. One trial studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy compared with Chinese herbs. 
When Chinese herbal medicines were given in combination with other pharmaceuticals they were associated with higher rates of continuous pregnancy beyond 20 weeks (92.1% versus 72.0%, from two trials, involving 189 women) and live births (79.7% versus 44.2% from six trials, involving 601 women) compared to the other pharmaceuticals alone. Live birth rate was not different when comparing Chinese herbal medicines alone and other pharmaceuticals alone (in one trial, involving 80 women). A comparison of continuing pregnancy rate was not available in this trial. Compared with psychotherapy alone, the live birth rate was higher in the group of women who received a combination of Chinese herbal medicine and psychotherapy (91.1% versus 68.9%). 
The majority of studies did not report any information about adverse effects for the mothers or the babies. Only two trials (involving 341 women) reported that no maternal adverse effects were found (one trial comparing (combined) medicines with other pharmaceuticals and one trial comparing combined Chinese herbal medicine alone versus other pharmaceuticals alone). Only one trial (comparing Chinese herbal medicine alone versus other pharmaceuticals alone) reported that there were no abnormal babies either before or after delivery. 
No study recorded its limitations in the trial report. It is unclear which Chinese herbal medicines or their combinations are effective.
