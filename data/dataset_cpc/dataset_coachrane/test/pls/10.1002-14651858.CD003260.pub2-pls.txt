Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and vascular disease is an enormous public health problem. Currently, an estimated 36 million people worldwide live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective interventions to reduce the burden of disease are urgently needed. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are non‐pharmacological methods that aim to help people with early‐stage dementia make the most of their memory and cognitive functioning despite the difficulties they are experiencing. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or problem‐solving. Cognitive rehabilitation focuses on identifying and addressing individual needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids. 
This review included 11 trials of cognitive training and a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation. We found no evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive functioning, mood or activities of daily living in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia; however the quality of the studies was generally not high. The single trial of cognitive rehabilitation provided preliminary indications of the potential benefits of individual cognitive rehabilitation in improving activities of daily living in people with mild Alzheimer's disease. More high‐quality trials of both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are needed to establish their efficacy for people with early‐stage dementia.
