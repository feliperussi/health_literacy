In children with liver disease, who have enlarged veins in the oesophagus (food pipe), does placing an elastic ring around the vein prevent it from bleeding? 
Bleeding in the oesophagusA blood clot in the veins that drain blood from the digestive tract into the liver (known as portal vein thrombosis) causes increased pressure in these veins. Increased blood pressure in the veins supplying blood to the liver is also common in serious liver disease. The increased pressure can make the veins in the oesophagus (the tube running from the throat to the stomach) swollen and enlarged. Bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus is a life‐threatening condition. 
How are enlarged veins in the oesophagus treated?In adults, studies have shown two treatments work well to treat bleeding from enlarged veins: 
‐ taking medicines called beta‐blockers; and‐ placing an elastic ring around the vein to cut off the blood flow through it. 
These two treatments have become the main ways to prevent bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus in adults. However, we do not know how well these treatments work in children and young people, or if they cause any unwanted effects or harms.   
Why we did this Cochrane ReviewWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of placing an elastic ring around an enlarged vein to prevent it from bleeding, in children with long‐lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
What we didWe searched for studies that tested the effects of placing an elastic ring around an enlarged vein in the oesophagus to prevent it from bleeding, compared with a sham treatment (the same procedure, but no band was placed) or no treatment, in children with long‐lasting liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
We looked for randomised clinical studies, in which the people taking part are randomly placed into different intervention groups. This type of study, if performed correctly, usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out about:
‐ how many children died;
‐ how many children had serious unwanted effects (effects considered life‐threatening or that needed hospital treatment) or liver‐related diseases; 
‐ the children's well‐being (quality of life);
‐ how many children had oesophageal bleeding; and
‐ how many children had any unwanted effects that were not considered serious.
How current is the evidence?The evidence in this review includes research published up to 27 April 2020. 
What we foundWe found only one report of a study that took place at three hospitals in the UK. It was a feasibility study: it looked at whether it would be possible to conduct larger and more conclusive randomised studies. A summary of the study data was published and presented at a conference. The study report was not good enough to judge the quality of the study. No information about funding was given.
