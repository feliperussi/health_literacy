Oral anti‐diabetic agents for women with diabetes or previous diabetes planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes 
What is the issue? 
Pre‐existing diabetes and gestational diabetes can increase the risks of a number of poor outcomes for both mothers and their babies. For the mother, these include pregnancy‐induced high blood pressure (pre‐eclampsia) with additional fluid retention and protein in the urine; and giving birth by caesarean. For the infant, these can include preterm birth; as well as an increased risk of the presence of physical defects at birth such as heart defects, brain, spine, and spinal cord defects, Down syndrome; and spontaneous abortion. Other complications at birth include babies that are large for their gestational age, and obstructed labour (shoulder dystocia) caused by one of the shoulders becoming stuck in the birth canal once the baby's head has been born. 
Why is this important? 
Being pregnant can trigger diabetes (gestational diabetes) in women with impaired glucose tolerance. Women who have had gestational diabetes are at risk of developing diabetes later in life. This means that management is important for women with impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes, as well as for women with established diabetes. Women with established diabetes need good blood sugar control before they become pregnant. Insulin gives good blood sugar control and does not affect the development of the baby, but women may find oral anti‐diabetic agents more convenient and acceptable than insulin injections. However little is known about the effects of these oral agents. 
This review sought to investigate the effects of oral anti‐diabetic agents in women with established diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes who were planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes, on maternal and infant health. This review is an update of a review that was first published in 2010. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 31 October 2016 and included six RCTs (707 women). Three RCTs included women with current gestational diabetes and did not report data separately for the population of women relevant to this review. Therefore we have only included outcome data from three RCTs, involving 241 pregnant women and their infants. The quality of the evidence was assessed as being low or very low and the overall risk of bias of the RCTs was varied. The three RCTs all compared an oral anti‐diabetic agent (metformin) with insulin in pregnant women with pre‐existing (type 2) diabetes. 
There was no clear difference in the development of pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) for women who received metformin compared with insulin (2 RCTs; 227 women; very low‐quality evidence), though women receiving metformin were less likely to have pregnancy‐induced high blood pressure in one RCT (206 women; low‐quality evidence). Women who received metformin were less likely to have a caesarean section birth (3 RCTs; 241 women; low‐quality evidence), though no difference was observed in induction of labour (2 RCTs; 35 women; very low‐quality evidence). There was no clear difference between groups of infants born to mothers who received metformin or insulin for being large‐for‐gestational age (1 RCT; 206 infants; very low‐quality evidence), though infants born to mothers who received metformin were less likely to have low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (3 RCTs; 241 infants; very low‐quality evidence). There were no infant deaths (before birth or shortly afterwards) (2 RCTs; very low‐quality evidence). The RCTs did not report on many important short‐ and long‐term outcomes, including perineal trauma and a combined outcome of infant death or morbidity, postnatal depression and weight retention for mothers, and adiposity or disability in childhood or adulthood for infants.
