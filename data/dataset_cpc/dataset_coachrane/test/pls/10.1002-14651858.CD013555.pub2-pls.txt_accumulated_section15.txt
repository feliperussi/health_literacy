The timing of treatment for broken bones in the legs and arms that also have open wounds 
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether the different timings of treatments (antibiotics, wound cleaning and whether to do all the surgery in one operation or more) might affect how well people recover from open long bone fractures. We found very few studies, and they did not provide reliable evidence. 
What is an open fracture? 
Some broken bones include open skin wounds around the break. These are called open fractures and are most common in high impact injuries such as road traffic accidents or falls from a height. In this review, we were interested in the treatment of open fractures of long bones (in the thigh, shin, lower leg, upper arm and forearms). These fractures can be very serious injuries. Because of the open wound, people are at serious risk of infection. A 'deep infection' involves the bone and will require further surgery; it may be limb‐threatening and affect long‐term recovery. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Antibiotics (to fight infection) may be started early (within an hour of injury) or later; they may be given for a short time (until the wound is surgically closed) or a longer time. 
‐ Debridement: surgically removing any dirt, foreign objects, or dead and damaged tissue from inside the wound: this may be done early (within 12 hours of injury) or later. 
‐ Treatment also includes surgery to fix the bone and close the wound (this may involve moving skin or muscle, or both, from another body area to cover the wound). All stages (debridement, fixing the bone, wound closure) may be completed during a single operation or in multiple operations. If this is done in multiple operations, the wound may be closed early (within 72 hours of injury) or later. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments for adults who had broken bones with open skin wounds. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. If we found similar studies, of the same treatments, we combined the findings from the studies to see if we could find out if some treatment resulted in better outcomes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 613 adults, who had 617 open fractures. Most fractures were in men, and the average age was 30 to 34 years. In two studies, the open fractures were in the shin bone (a common place for this type of injury because there is not much skin and muscle between the bone and skin surface). In the other study, injuries were in arms and legs. 
One study compared giving antibiotics for 24 hours (short course) with five days of antibiotics (long course). It is unclear if these treatment times had an effect on the number of people who developed superficial infections within 14 days. Superficial infections are in the skin around the wound, but not deep enough to affect the bone; they may occur early in the recovery period and can be easily treated with antibiotics only. 
Two studies compared closing the wound immediately after fixing the bone with a delay to closing the wound. It is unclear if timing of wound closure had an effect on the number of people who developed deep infections, superficial infections, or had delayed bone union (when the broken parts of the bone heal together more slowly than expected) or non‐union (when the bone does not heal).
