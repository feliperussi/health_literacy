Lung recruitment manoeuvres for reducing mortality and respiratory morbidity in mechanically ventilated neonates 
Review question 
In mechanically ventilated neonates, do lung recruitment manoeuvres (LRMs) help to reduce mortality and respiratory morbidity, compared to no recruitment?  
Background 
Critically ill neonates (infants from birth up to four weeks of age) commonly require intubation (placement of a breathing tube in the windpipe) and conventional mechanical ventilation (the use of a breathing machine) to support their breathing. Whilst this therapy is often lifesaving, it also carries the risk of lung injury. LRMs have been suggested to reduce the incidence of lung injury and improve respiratory outcomes in ventilated patients. A LRM involves deliberately increasing airway pressure for a brief period, which serves to reopen collapsed lung regions. LRMs have proved effective in ventilated adults; however, evidence regarding their use in neonates is limited. There is no consensus of opinion as to whether LRMs are appropriate or effective in this population. 
Study characteristics 
In a search up to 13 April 2020, we identified four studies that investigated LRM use in mechanically ventilated neonates. Two studies enrolling 44 preterm neonates (born before 30 weeks' gestational age) with respiratory distress syndrome compared a LRM within hours of birth to routine care. The third study involving 12 neonates compared two different types of LRMs applied directly after suctioning of the breathing tube to routine care. A fourth study enrolling 48 paediatric patients (including neonates) also compared a LRM after suctioning to routine care. This study did not contribute data to the review as the data pertaining to neonatal participants could not be isolated.
