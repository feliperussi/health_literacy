Bisphosphonate treatment to improve bone health in children with cerebral palsy
Why is this review important? 
Poor bone strength is common in people with cerebral palsy (CP). Causes include: reduced weight‐bearing activities that build bone strength, such as walking or running, particularly among people who require mobility assistance devices; reduced intake of vitamins and minerals that increase bone strength, including calcium and vitamin D; and increased use of medications that prevent bone formation, such as anti‐seizure medications. This leads to a high risk of bone fractures, even with very mild trauma. Children with CP who are unable to walk are at particularly high risk of poor bone strength and fractures in the leg bones. Bisphosphonates are a group of medications that are used to improve bone strength. Bisphosphonates are commonly used in adults with poor bone strength. However, there is a lack of evidence for their use in children. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
First, what is the effect of bisphosphonate treatment compared to placebo (dummy pill) or no treatment on different measures of bone strength in children up to 18 years with CP? Measures include blood markers of bone health, fracture frequency, bone pain, and quality of life. 
Second, are there any negative side effects?
Which studies were included in the review? 
We examined the available evidence for the use of bisphosphonate treatment in children with CP up to September 2020. We found two trials that compared the use of bisphosphonate treatment with placebo or no treatment to improve bone strength in children with CP. These two trials included a total of 34 participants with CP of similar levels of severity. Participants in both studies were 16 years of age or under, and there were equal numbers of boys and girls in each trial. Both trials included children who were unable to walk. The two trials used different types of bisphosphonate treatments, given for six months in one study and 12 months in the other. Further comparison of these treatments was not possible due to a lack of published information in one trial. 
One trial was supported by research, academic and hospital foundations, with pharmaceutical companies donating components of the calcium and vitamin supplements. The other study did not report their funding sources. 
What does the evidence from the review reveal? 
Results from both trials provide some evidence that giving children with CP bisphosphonate treatment for at least six months, may improve their bone strength. The strength of this effect could only be measured in one trial with 12 participants. This suggested an average improvement in bone strength of 18%, measured by bone mineral density (BMD). However, because of the very small number of participants in both trials, the wide variation in results, and some problems with the way the trials were conducted, this conclusion is uncertain.
