Cutting back on sugar‐sweetened beverages: What works?
What are sugar‐sweetened beverages? 
Sugar‐sweetened beverages (SSBs) are cold and hot drinks with added sugar. Common SSBs are non‐diet soft drinks, regular soda, iced tea, sports drinks, energy drinks, fruit punches, sweetened waters, and sweetened tea and coffee. 
Why are SSBs an important health topic? 
Research shows that people who drink a lot of SSBs often gain weight. Drinking a lot of SSBs can also increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and dental decay. Doctors therefore recommend that children, teenagers and adults drink fewer SSBs. Governments, businesses, schools and workplaces have taken various measures to support healthier beverage choices. 
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out whether the measures taken so far have been successful in helping people to drink fewer SSBs to improve their health. We focused on measures that change the environment in which people make beverage choices. We did not look at studies on educational programmes or on SSB taxes, as these are examined in separate reviews. (We did, however, examine price increases on SSB which were not due to taxes.) We searched for all available studies meeting clearly‐defined criteria to answer this question. This review reflects the state of the evidence up until January 2018. 
What studies did we find? 
We found 58 studies, which included more than one million adults, teenagers and children. Most studies lasted about one year, and were done in schools, stores or restaurants. 
Some studies used methods that are not very reliable. For example, in some studies participants were simply asked how much SSB they drank, which is not very reliable, as people sometimes forget how much SSB they drank. Some of the findings of our review may therefore change when more and better studies become available. 
What do these studies tell us? 
We have found some evidence that some of the measures implemented to help people drink fewer SSBs have been successful, including the following: 
▪ Labels which are easy to understand, such as traffic‐light labels, and labels which rate the healthfulness of beverages with stars or numbers. 
▪ Limits to the availability of SSB in schools (e.g. replacing SSBs with water in school cafeterias). 
▪ Price increases on SSBs in restaurants, stores and leisure centres.
▪ Children’s menus in chain restaurants which include healthier beverages as their standard beverage. 
▪ Promotion of healthier beverages in supermarkets.
▪ Government food benefits (e.g. food stamps) which cannot be used to buy SSBs.
▪ Community campaigns focused on SSBs.
▪ Measures that improve the availability of low‐calorie beverages at home, e.g. through home deliveries of bottled water and diet beverages. 
We have also found some evidence that improved availability of drinking water and diet beverages at home can help people lose weight. 
There are also other measures which may influence how much SSB people drink, but for these the available evidence is less certain. 
Some, but not all studies found that such measures can have effects which were not intended and which may be negative. Some studies reported that profits of stores and restaurants decreased when the measures were implemented, but other studies showed that profits increased or stayed the same. Children who get free drinking water in schools may drink less milk. Some studies reported that people were unhappy with the measures. 
We also looked at studies on sugar‐sweetened milk. We found that small prizes for children who chose plain milk in their school cafeteria, as well as emoticon labels, may help children drink less sugar‐sweetened milk. However, this may also drive up the share of milk which is wasted because children choose but do not drink it. 
What does this mean in practice? 
Our review shows that measures which change the environment in which people make beverage choices can help people drink less SSB. Based on our findings we suggest that such measures may be used more widely. Government officials, business people and health professionals implementing such measures should work together with researchers to find out more about their effects in the short and long term.
