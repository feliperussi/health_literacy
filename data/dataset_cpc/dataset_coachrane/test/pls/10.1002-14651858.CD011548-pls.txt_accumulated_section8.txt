Ultrasound and liver function tests for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones
Background 
Bile, produced in the liver and stored temporarily in the gallbladder, is released into the small bowel on eating fatty food. The common bile duct is the tube through which bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel. Stones in the common bile duct (common bile duct stones), usually formed in the gallbladder before migration into the bile duct, can obstruct the flow of bile leading to jaundice (yellowish discolouration of skin, white of the eyes, and dark urine); infection of the bile (cholangitis); and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can be life threatening. Various diagnostic tests can be performed for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones. Depending upon the availability of resources, these stones are removed endoscopically (usually the case) or may be removed as a part of the operation performed to remove the gallbladder (it is important to remove the gallbladder since the stones continue to form in the gallbladder and can cause recurrent problems). Non‐invasive tests such as ultrasound (use of sound waves higher than audible range to differentiate tissues based on how they reflect the sound waves) and blood markers of bile flow obstruction such as serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase are used to identify people at high risk of having common bile duct stones. Using non‐invasive tests means that only those people at high risk can be subjected to further tests. We reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests for detection of common bile duct stones. The evidence is current to September 2012. 
Study characteristics 
We identified five studies including 523 participants that reported the diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasound. One of these studies, involving 262 participants, also reported the diagnostic test accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase. All the studies included people with symptoms. One study included only participants who had not undergone previous cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder). This information was not available from the remaining studies. 
Key results 
Based on an average sensitivity of 73% for ultrasound, we would expect that on average 73 out of 100 people with common bile duct stones will be detected while the remaining 27 people will be missed and will not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of people with common bile duct stones detected using ultrasound may vary between 44 and 90 out of 100 people. Based on an average specificity of 91% for ultrasound, we would expect that on average 91 out of 100 people without common bile duct stones would be identified as not having common bile duct stones; 9 out of 100 would be false positives and not receive appropriate treatment. The average number of false positives could vary between 5 and 16 out of 100 people. 
Evidence from one study suggested that using a level of serum alkaline phosphatase higher than 125 units to distinguish between people who have and people who do not have common bile duct stones gave better diagnostic accuracy than using a level twice the normal limit (which usually ranges between 0 and 40). The study also showed better accuracy for serum alkaline phosphatase compared to serum bilirubin.
