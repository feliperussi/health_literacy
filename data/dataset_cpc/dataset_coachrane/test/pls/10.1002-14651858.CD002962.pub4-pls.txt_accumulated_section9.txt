Acupuncture or acupressure for induction of labour
What is the issue? 
Induction of labour is offered to pregnant women when it is thought the outcome will be better for the mother or her baby if the pregnancy does not continue and the baby is born. Common reasons for induction include the pregnancy going beyond the due date, pre‐term or pre‐labour rupture of the membranes, and concerns about the health of the mother or baby such as pre‐eclampsia or poor growth of the baby. Some women look to using complementary therapies alongside conventional medical practice for induction. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points of the body while acupressure involves using the thumbs or fingers to apply pressure to specific points. Both have been used to help soften and dilate the cervix with onset of labour contractions. They may provide a way of reducing labour pain and avoiding a medical induction with other methods such as prostaglandins. 
Why is this important? 
Medical inductions can have significant side effects. Many women therefore choose complementary and alternative methods to bring on labour. Acupuncture is practiced by many midwives together with usual care, and early studies have suggested a benefit from acupuncture. 
What evidence did we find? 
In October 2016, we searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture. We identified eight additional trials that were eligible for the review since the last version of the review in 2013. In total, we found 22 trials which reported on 3456 pregnant women. The authors rated most of the trials as having moderate risk of bias. 
Moderate to high‐quality evidence found that acupuncture and acupressure did not reduce caesarean sections. 
Acupuncture may promote a more favourable state of the cervix within 24 hours in the two trials (192 women) that looked at this. Only one trial reported on serious outcomes for the mother or her baby, finding no serious incidents in either the acupuncture or the control group (low‐quality evidence).
