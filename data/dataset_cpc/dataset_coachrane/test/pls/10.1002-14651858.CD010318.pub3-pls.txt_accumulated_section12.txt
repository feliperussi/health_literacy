Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus
What was the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about whether or not negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is effective in treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found 11 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether NPWT is effective for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. There is some low‐certainty evidence that NPWT increases the number of wounds healed compared with dressings, and may reduce the time it takes wounds to heal. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of different pressures of NPWT on wound healing. Overall, the reliability of the evidence provided by the trials is too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of NPWT for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. 
What did the review study? 
Diabetes mellitus is a common condition that leads to high blood glucose (blood sugar) concentrations, with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Some people with diabetes can develop ulcers on their feet. These wounds can take a long time to heal, they can be painful and become infected. Ulceration of the foot in people with diabetes can also lead to a higher risk of amputation of parts of the foot or leg. Generally, people with diabetes are at a higher risk of lower‐limb amputation than people without diabetes. 
NPWT is a treatment currently being used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. Worldwide, the use of NPWT is increasing. However, it is expensive compared with wound treatments such as dressings. 
We wanted to find out if NPWT could help foot wounds in people with diabetes to heal more quickly and effectively. We wanted to know if people treated with NPWT experienced any side effects. We were also interested in the impact of NPWT on people's quality of life. 
What were the main results of the review? 
In January 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared NPWT with other treatments for foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 11 trials involving 972 adults. Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 15 to 341 and trial follow‐up (observation) times ranged from four weeks to 16 weeks where specified. Not all the studies stated how they were funded. Two were funded by an NPWT manufacturer. 
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT may be effective in healing postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with diabetes compared with wound dressings, in terms of the proportion of wounds healed and time to healing. For the comparison of different pressures of NPWT for foot ulcers in people with diabetes, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and side effects. There was no evidence available on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness.
