What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active? 
Background 
Being physically active is important for everyone's health. It can be particularly difficult for people with COPD and we do not know the best way to improve physical activity. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes 76 studies involving 8018 people with COPD (published before 27 June 2019). Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Many strategies have been developed and different studies have measured physical activity in lots of different ways. This means that it was hard to compare and combine their findings. It was also hard to tell exactly what was involved in some of the interventions, and therefore which components were important for improving physical activity. 
Key results 
Some studies looked at current interventions for people with COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation and different types of exercise training as well as self‐management and education. Other studies have looked at special types of nutritional supplements, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation and singing. 
Some strategies that did work involved exercise training, physical activity counselling and COPD medications. Some studies showed that people did an extra 6 to 24 minutes of at least moderate‐intensity physical activity, as well as walking for longer or taking more steps each day. However, we are still uncertain about when or how these approaches should be used. Only a few studies followed people up after the intervention finished. It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits.
