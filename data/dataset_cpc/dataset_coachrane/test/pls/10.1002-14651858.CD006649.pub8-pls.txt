Blood thinners for the initial treatment of blood clots in people with cancer
BackgroundPeople with cancer are at increased risk of blood clots. The blood thinner (anticoagulant) administered in the first few days after identifying a blood clot can consist of unfractionated heparin (infused through a vein), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, injected under the skin once or twice per day; dalteparin and tinzaparin are two different types of low molecular weight heparin), or fondaparinux (injected under the skin once daily). These blood thinners may have different effectiveness and safety profiles. 
Study characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing different blood thinners in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of clots in the limbs or in the lungs. We included trials of adults and children with either solid tumours or blood cancer, irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at death, recurrent blood clots, and bleeding. The evidence is current to August 2021. 
Key resultsWe identified 15 studies in total. Data from five studies suggested that the LMWH may reduce death at three months compared to UFH, and may reduce recurrent clots slightly. We found no data to compare the effect of these two medications on bleeding outcomes. Also, we found that fondaparinux may increase death at three months, may result in little to no difference in recurrent clots and major bleeding, and probably increases minor bleeding. Also, the current evidence found that dalteparin, a type of LMWH, may reduce death slightly, may reduce recurrent clots, may increase major bleeding slightly, and may reduce minor bleeding slightly. 
Certainty of the evidenceWe judged the certainty of evidence for low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin to be low for all assessed outcomes; for fondaparinux versus heparin to be low certainty, except for minor bleeding which was moderate certainty; and for tinzaparin versus dalteparin, to be low certainty.
