Biophysical profile for fetal assessment in high risk pregnancies
Not enough evidence to support use of biophysical profile (BPP) for the assessment of fetal well‐being in high‐risk pregnancies. 
Monitoring the baby's well‐being in the uterus in pregnancy is often undertaken using a cardiotocograph (CTG) machine. A CTG assesses the pattern of the baby's heartbeats alongside the size of the mother's contractions. However, this is not a very accurate test on its own. So monitoring the baby's movements has also been suggested as a useful addition to predict babies in difficulty. This is because a reduction in fetal movement sometimes precedes a baby's death. It is thought that if the oxygen supply to the baby through the afterbirth (placenta) is insufficient, the baby responds by moving less often. As fetal movement patterns may vary considerably, multiple fetal activities might be a better predictor of poor outcome. Consequently, the biophysical profile (BPP) and modified biophysical profile (MBPP) have been introduced. The BPP uses ultrasound to assess 1) fetal movement, 2) tone, 3) breathing and 4) the amniotic fluid volume that surrounds the baby. In addition, the baby's heartbeat is monitored over a 20‐minute period using a CTG machine. This produces a paper tracing of the baby's heart rate, the mother's contractions and when the baby moves. Sometimes a modified BPP is used first (MBPP), involving the CTG trace and the amniotic fluid volume only. If this indicates a possible abnormality, then the full BPP is used. This review of trials compared the BPP (or MBPP) with conventional monitoring (CTG only) on pregnancy outcome in high‐risk pregnancies. Five trials involving 2974 women with pregnancies with a high risk of poorer fetal outcome were found. There was no difference between the groups in the number of babies that died, nor in the number of babies who had low Apgar scores. However, although the number of women involved was small, the BPP was associated with a significant increase in induction and caesarean section. However, the data are insufficient to reach a conclusion about the benefit or otherwise of the BPP as a test of fetal wellbeing.
