Different antibiotics for group A streptococcal pharyngitis
Review question 
We wanted to know which antibiotic was more effective in treating sore throats caused by bacteria (group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci (GABHS)). 
Background 
Most sore throats are caused by viruses, but many people carry throat bacteria, which sometimes causes bacterial throat infection. 
GABHS infection can have serious complications including rheumatic fever and kidney disease. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications, but provide modest benefit for sore throat, even if GABHS are present. Most throat infections resolve without treatment, and complication risks are extremely low for most people in high‐income countries. However, sometimes antibiotics are needed. Penicillin, an inexpensive antibiotic, has been used to treat GABHS for many years. GABHS resistance to penicillin is rare. 
Search date 
We searched the literature to 3 September 2020.
Study characteristics 
We included 19 trials (18 publications) that involved 5839 people. The included trials studied different antibiotics for people with sore throat who tested positive for GABHS, and were aged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only children, and 10 trials included people aged 12 years or older. Most studies were published over 15 years ago, and all but one reported on outcome measures relevant for patients. 
Study funding sources 
Twelve trials reported funding from drug companies. Authors of six trials (in five publications) were employed by drug companies. Seven trials (in six publications) did not report funding sources. 
Key results 
Antibiotic effects were similar, and all antibiotics caused side effects (such as nausea and vomiting, rash), but there was no strong evidence to show meaningful differences between antibiotics. Studies did not report on long‐term complications, therefore it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.
