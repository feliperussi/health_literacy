Comparison of non‐surgical treatments for women diagnosed with high‐grade VIN (precancerous changes of the vulva related to HPV‐infection) 
Background 
This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2011. Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a skin condition affecting the vulval skin, which, if left untreated, may become cancerous. Distressing symptoms include itching, burning, and soreness of the vulva or painful intercourse. There may be discolouration and various other visible changes to the vulval skin. There are two types of VIN: the most common type (now known as usual‐type VIN or uVIN) is associated with infection of the cells of the vulva with a virus called human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus), whereas the other type (known as differentiated‐type VIN) is not associated with this viral infection. As HPV infection is common, uVIN is becoming more common in younger women (under 50 years of age). At the moment treatments are aimed at relief of distressing symptoms and to ensure that the condition does not become cancerous.The most common treatment option for women with this condition has been surgery to remove the affected skin areas. Surgery, however, does not guarantee a cure, can be disfiguring, and may result in physical and psychological problems in younger women who are sexually active. 
Potential non‐surgical treatment options include imiquimod, indole‐3‐carbinol, cidofovir, IFN‐α and HPV vaccines. These mainly work by enhancing the body's immune system. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of these non‐surgical treatments. 
Methods  The previous version of this review included four randomised controlled trials. We updated the literature search from September 2010 to March 2015 and identified one new completed trial and five ongoing trials to add to the review. 
Findings 
In total, we included five randomised controlled trials involving 297 women. Three trials assessed imiquimod compared with placebo, one trial assessed imiquimod compared with cidofovir, and one compared two different doses of indole‐3‐carbinol. We pooled data from the three similar trials involving 104 women and found imiquimod to be more effective in clearing high‐grade VIN lesions by six months than placebo. Most studies did not include longer term follow‐up, but findings from one study suggested that women in whom VIN was completely cleared at six months were likely to sustain this response by 12 months. This single study showed no difference in rates of progression to cancer between study groups. We are uncertain about these longer‐term findings and would like them to be corroborated by other trials. We found limited evidence on side‐effects. However, evidence from one study found that side‐effects, such as pain and itching of the skin over the vulva, occurred more frequently among women in the imiquimod group compared with the placebo group, and were usually managed by reducing the frequency of applications. 
The trial comparing imiquimod with cidofovir involved 180 women. These topical treatments appeared to be similarly effective at six months. However, there were no longer term results available for this trial. 
The trial of indole‐3‐carbinol was a small trial of only 13 women that compared two different doses of the medication and we could not draw any conclusions about this treatment. 
We found no evidence on the effectiveness of other treatments, such as HPV vaccines to treat high‐grade VIN; however, we identified five ongoing trials that may provide important evidence in the future.
