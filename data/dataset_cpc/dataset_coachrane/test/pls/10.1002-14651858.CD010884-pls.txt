Resistance training (such as weight‐lifting) for fibromyalgia
Research question 
What are the effects of resistance exercise training for people with fibromyalgia on wellness, symptoms, fitness, and adverse effects? 
Background 
What problems does fibromyalgia cause? People with fibromyalgia have chronic, widespread body pain, and often have fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression and problems sleeping. 
What is resistance training? Resistance training is exercise that involves lifting weights, or using machines or elastic bands that provide resistance to movement. 
‐ This review only looked at resistance training programs supervised by a trained professional. 
‐ We compared resistance training to no exercise and to other types of exercise.
Study characteristics 
After looking for all related studies in March 2013, we found 5 studies with 219 women with fibromyalgia. Ninety‐five (95) of these women did resistance training. 
Only three studies looked at wellness, symptoms, and fitness in 54 women with fibromyalgia who did resistance training and 53 women with fibromyalgia who did not do resistance training. 
The 54 women with fibromyalgia who did resistance training:
‐ did supervised resistance training sessions using exercise equipment, free weights, and body weight 
‐ exercised 2 to 3 times a week
‐ exercised for 16 to 21 weeks.
Key results: what happened to women with fibromyalgia who took part in resistance training for 16 to 21 weeks compared to those who did not do resistance training during this time period? 
Overall well‐being (multidimensional function) on a scale of 0 to 100 units 
Women who did resistance training rated their well‐being 25 units better while women who did not do resistance training rated their well‐being 8 units better. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training rated their well‐being 17 units better at the end of the studies than those who did not do resistance training. 
Physical function (ability to do normal activities) on a scale of 0 to 100 units 
Women who did resistance training rated their ability to do normal activities 8 units better while women who did not do resistance training rated their ability to do normal activities 2 units better. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training rated their ability to function 6 units better at the end of the studies than women who did not do resistance training. 
Pain on a scale of 0 to 10 units 
Women who did resistance training rated their pain 3.5 units better while women who did not do resistance training rated their pain 1 unit better. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training rated their pain 2.5 units better at the end of the studies than women who did not do resistance training. 
Tenderness estimated by number of points (out of 18) perceived as painful with 4 kilograms of pressure 
Women who did resistance training had 4 fewer tender points while women who did not do resistance training had 2 fewer tender points. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training had 2 fewer tender points at the end of the studies than women who did not do resistance training. 
Muscle strength  
Women who did resistance training could lift 28 kilograms more while women who did not do resistance training could lift 1 kilogram more. 
Therefore, women who did resistance training could lift 27 kilograms more at the end of the studies than women who did not do resistance training. 
Dropping out (number of women out of 100 who dropped out of the studies) 
Thirteen women who did resistance training dropped out while 4 women who did not do resistance training dropped out. 
Therefore, 9 more women out of 100 who did resistance training dropped out of the studies than women who did not do resistance training. 
Conclusions 
For women with fibromyalgia, resistance training for 16 to 21 weeks likely improves 
‐ ability to do normal activities
‐ pain, tenderness, muscle strength and overall well‐being.
Quality of the evidence 
‐ Because so few studies have been done so far, more research is likely to change these results. 
‐ While we do not have exact information about side effects experienced by women with fibromyalgia during the studies, no injuries were reported. 
‐ We do not know if the results would be the same for men, because only women took part in the studies.
