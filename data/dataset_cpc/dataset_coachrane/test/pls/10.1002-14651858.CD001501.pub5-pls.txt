Are newer methods for destroying the lining of the uterus (endometrial ablation) more effective and safer compared to established methods? 
Review question 
This review compared the effectiveness, safety, acceptability, and complication rates of first‐, second‐ and third‐generation methods available to destroy the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (heavy periods) in premenopausal women. 
Background 
Medication and hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb) used to be the main treatment options for heavy menstrual bleeding. Both are still effective and safe options, but available new treatments focus on removing the lining of the womb (endometrium) from which the bleeding comes. These procedures involve either removing the endometrium (resection) or destroying it with thermal (heat) energy from a laser, electrical instruments, or other devices (ablation). These treatments can stop or reduce menstrual bleeding. 
Study characteristics 
This review identified 28 randomised controlled trials undertaken in 4287 women. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of study quality varied among trials. Evidence is current to May 2018. Nineteen of the 28 trials acknowledged that they received funding, supplies of equipment, or technical assistance from the pharmaceutical industry and from equipment manufacturers. 
Key results 
Moderate‐ to very low‐quality evidence suggests that first‐ and second‐generation approaches were equally effective in the treatment of HMB. Newer (second‐generation) treatment approaches were safer in terms of rate of fluid overload, cervical lacerations, and haematometra, with similar rates of uterine perforation. The newer approaches (second‐generation ablation) were quicker and were more likely to be done under local (rather than general) anaesthesia compared with first‐generation approaches. Most women in both groups were satisfied with results of the procedure. Not enough evidence is available to show which second‐generation approaches are superior to others, and information about third‐generation approaches is not available for comparison. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Few studies were blinded, data were limited, and heterogeneity was substantial for some outcomes, leading to downgrading of the quality of evidence.
