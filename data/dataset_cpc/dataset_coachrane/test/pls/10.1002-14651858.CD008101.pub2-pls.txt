Continuous glucose monitoring systems for type 1 diabetes mellitus
Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas has lost its ability to make insulin. A deficit in insulin leads to increases in blood glucose levels, these elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications which may affect the eyes, kidneys, nerves and the heart and blood vessels. Since there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, patients need to check their blood glucose levels often by fingerprick and use these blood glucose values to decide on their insulin dosages. Fingerpricks are often regarded as cumbersome and uncomfortable by patients. In addition, fingerprick measurements only provide information about a single point in time, so it is difficult to discern trends in decline of rises in blood glucose levels. 
Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) measure blood glucose levels semi‐continuously. Most modern CGM systems consist of a small needle which is inserted in the abdominal subcutaneous fat. The tip of the needle houses a small glucose sensor which can measure glucose levels in the fluid which surrounds the fatty tissue. Here we explore whether CGM systems help the patient to increase quality of life and her glycaemic control, which reflects how well the patient's diabetes is treated. 
In this review 22 studies were included. These studies randomised 2883 patients with type 1 diabetes to receive a form of CGM or to use self measurement of blood glucose (SMBG) using fingerprick. The duration of follow‐up varied between 3 and 18 months; most studies reported results for six months of CGM use. This review shows that CGM helps in lowering the glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value (a measure of glycaemic control). In most studies the HbA1c value decreased (denoting improvement of glycaemic control) in both the CGM and the SMBG users, but more in the CGM group. The difference in change in HbA1c levels between the groups was on average 0.7% for patients starting on an insulin pump with integrated CGM and 0.2% for patients starting with CGM alone. The most important adverse events, severe hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis did not occur frequently in the studies, and absolute numbers were low (9% of the patients, measured over six months). Diabetes complications, death from any cause and costs were not measured. There are no data on pregnant women with diabetes type 1 and patients with diabetes who are not aware of hypoglycaemia.
