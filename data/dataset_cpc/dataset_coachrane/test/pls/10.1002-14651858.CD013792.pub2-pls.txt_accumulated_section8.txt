Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo.
