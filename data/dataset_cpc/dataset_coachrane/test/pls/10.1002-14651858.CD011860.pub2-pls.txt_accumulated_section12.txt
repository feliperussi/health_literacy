Do education and training programs reduce aggressive behavior toward healthcare workers?
What is aggressive behavior? 
The International Labour Organization uses the term "workplace violence" defined as "any action, incident or behaviour that departures from reasonable conduct in which a person is threatened, harmed, injured in the course of, or as a direct result of, his or her work". Experiencing aggressive behavior at work can affect people's ability to do their job well, can cause physical and mental health problems, and can also affect home life. Aggressive behavior may lead to absences from work; some people might leave their job if they experience aggressive behavior. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Aggressive behavior exhibited by patients and their families, friends, and carers is a serious problem for healthcare workers. It may affect the quality and safety of the care that healthcare workers can provide. 
Education and training programs have been developed to try to reduce—or eliminate—aggressive behavior at work. These programs are intended to teach and train healthcare workers about: 
• their organization's policies and procedures;
• how to assess risks; and
• strategies to control or reduce the chances—and effects—of experiencing aggressive behavior. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated how well education and training programs prevented or reduced aggression toward healthcare workers. 
We included randomized controlled studies, in which the programs that people received were decided at random and studies in which effects of a program were measured before and after among people who completed the program and in another group of people who did not take part.
