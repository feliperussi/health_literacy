Effect of applying cricoid pressure during rapid sequence induction of general anaesthesia
Background 
Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a technique used by critical care clinicians, mainly anaesthetists, intensive care physicians and emergency physicians, when setting out to secure a clear airway for a general anaesthetic and the patient is thought to be at risk of vomiting their stomach contents into their airway and down into their lungs. Stomach contents in the lungs can cause infection of the lung and, in severe cases, death. Cricoid pressure is a technique where pressure is placed on an area of bone‚Äêlike tissue in the neck to flatten the oesophagus (tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). This is intended to prevent vomiting up of the stomach contents. The application of cricoid pressure for this purpose is very common. It is, however, a controversial practice as some clinicians and researchers believe it to be ineffective. It may also interfere with the clinician's view of the patient's airway. 
Study characteristics 
Our search strategy was designed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where RSI was undertaken to secure an artificial airway for a general anaesthetic with or without the application of cricoid pressure. Vomiting or regurgitation of stomach contents during anaesthesia was to be assessed either by looking directly down the airway or by various laboratory and imaging (radiological) methods. We also set out to determine whether applying cricoid pressure caused any harm. 
Key findings 
We searched the databases until May 2015. Only one RCT met our inclusion criteria but unfortunately this trial did not report on any clinically relevant results. We classified one other trial as ongoing. The researchers have reported on their planned protocol for the clinical trial, where cricoid pressure applied using a measured force will be compared with cricoid pressure without measuring the force applied. The number of patients who vomit is to be monitored.
