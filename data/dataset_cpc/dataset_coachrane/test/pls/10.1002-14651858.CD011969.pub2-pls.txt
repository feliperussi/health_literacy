Stopping or reducing versus continuing long‐term proton pump inhibitor use in adults
Review question 
This review aimed to build on prior work and evaluate the effects of stopping or lowering the dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; acid‐reducing medicines) in adults, compared to what is commonly done in practice (i.e. continuing long‐term (more than four weeks) daily PPI use. Effects include both benefits and harms (e.g. pill use, symptom control, and cost). 
Background 
PPIs are used for many different conditions (e.g. heartburn, acid reflux, stomach ulceration). Studies for most of these conditions only support short‐term use (two to 12 weeks), yet these medicines are commonly continued for prolonged periods or even indefinitely. Long‐term PPI use contributes to medicine misuse and puts people at risk of experiencing unwanted drug interactions and side effects (e.g. diarrhea, headache, bone fractures). It also leads to a high cost burden on the healthcare system. 'Deprescribing' involves slowly withdrawing and stopping medicines. The most common approach is 'on‐demand' therapy, which allows people to use medicines only when they have symptoms (i.e. when heartburn begins). The overall goal of deprescribing is to minimize the number of medicines a person takes, thereby reducing inappropriate medicine use and avoiding side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We found six trials with 1758 participants. Of these, five studies looked at on‐demand deprescribing and one trial looked at abruptly stopping PPIs. Participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial (average age of 73 years). The majority of participants had moderate heart burn and acid reflux with milder forms of esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe that may lead to damage). 
Key results 
We found that deprescribing methods led to worse symptoms control while considerably reducing pill use. Deprescribing PPIs may lead to side effects such as inflammation of the esophagus. Very few data were available to make a conclusion regarding long‐term benefits and harms of PPI reduction or discontinuation. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the quality of evidence for this review ranged from very low to moderate. Trials were inconsistent with how they reported symptom control. There were also limitations in how the studies were conducted (e.g. participants and investigators may have known which medicine they received), which lowered the quality of evidence. Other contributing factors included small sample sizes for most trials and inconsistent results between studies.
