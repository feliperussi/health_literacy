Hybrid versus conventional open repair for aortic arch dissection
Background 
A dissection of the aorta is a separation or tear of the intima from the media. This tear allows blood to flow not only through the original aortic flow channel (known as the true lumen), but also through a second channel between the intima and media (known as the false lumen). A dissection can then develop along the artery, secondary to the blood flowing into the space. Aortic dissection is a life‚Äêthreatening condition which can rapidly be fatal. Aortic dissection that affects the ascending aorta, aortic arch and the descending aorta is a challenge for physicians. There is debate on the best surgical approach for aortic arch dissection. People with ascending aortic dissection have poor rates of survival. Currently, open surgical repair is regarded as the standard treatment for aortic arch dissection. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched medical databases for clinical trials that compared the use of a hybrid technique versus open surgical technique for people who suffered from arterial dissection of the aortic arch (last search February 2021). We identified one ongoing study and two unpublished studies, which met the inclusion criteria for the review. However, due to a lack of published study data, we could not compare the outcomes of hybrid repair to conventional open repair for aortic arch dissection. 
Certainty of the evidence 
In the absence of study data for those identified as eligible for inclusion in the review, it was not possible to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Conclusion 
There is an absence of data for patients with this type of condition. Reasons may include its acute nature, and the need to intervene quickly in a surgical environment; patients with aortic arch dissection often suffer from many other conditions, which prevent them having particular surgeries; and often centres and surgical expertise may be lacking in this area, leading to a culture of using conventional rather than contemporary methods.
