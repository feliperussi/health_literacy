Therapy for treatment and prevention of pouchitis
What is pouchitis? 
Some people with ulcerative colitis have their colon and rectum removed with construction of a pouch (made from a loop of small intestine) in place of the rectum ‐ known as ileal pouch‐anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery. Pouchitis is inflammation of the surgically‐constructed pouch. Symptoms of active pouchitis include diarrhea, increased stool frequency, abdominal cramping, fecal urgency, tenesmus (feeling of constantly needing to pass stools), and incontinence. Acute refers to symptoms that last less than four weeks while chronic refers to symptoms that last more than four weeks. Periods when symptoms stop are called 'remission'. 
What therapies are used for pouchitis? 
Therapies used for pouchitis include antibiotics (drugs for bacteria infections), budesonide enemas (a steroid drug), probiotics (helpful bacteria), biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor, glutamine suppositories (an amino acid), butyrate suppositories (short chain fatty acid), bismuth enemas (diarrhea medication), allopurinol (a purine analogue drug), and tinidazole (an anti‐parasitic drug). 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers investigated whether these medications produce remission in people with active pouchitis, maintain remission in people with inactive pouchitis or prevent pouchitis in people who've had IPAA surgery. Side effects were also assessed. The medical literature was searched up to 25 July 2018. 
What did the researchers find? 
We found 15 studies with a total of 547 participants. Four studies assessed treatment of acute pouchitis. Five studies assessed treatment of chronic pouchitis. Six studies assessed prevention of pouchitis. 
Acute pouchitis: It is uncertain whether ciprofloxacin is more effective than metronidazole for treatment of acute pouchitis (1 study, 16 participants). Side effects included vomiting, metallic taste and temporary damage to nerves. It is unclear whether there are any differences between metronidazole and budesonide enemas in terms of clinical remission, symptom improvement or side effects (1 study, 26 participants). Side effects included anorexia, nausea, headache, lack of energy and strength, metallic taste, vomiting, pins and needles, and depression. It is uncertain whether there are any differences between rifaximin and placebo in terms of clinical remission, symptom improvement, or side effects (1 study, 18 participants). Side effects included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, rectal pain, vomiting, thirst, yeast infection, common cold, increased liver enzymes, and cluster headache. It is uncertain whether there is any difference between Lactobacillus GG and placebo in symptom improvement (1 study, 20 participants. The results of these studies are uncertain due to low event numbers caused by the small numbers of people who participated in the studies.
