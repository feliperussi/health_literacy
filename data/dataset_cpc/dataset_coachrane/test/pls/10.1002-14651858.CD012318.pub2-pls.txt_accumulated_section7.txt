Radial artery versus femoral artery approach for performing coronary catheter procedures in people with coronary artery disease 
Review question 
Should physicians introduce the catheter (a long, thin tube) through the femoral artery (transfemoral access via the groin) or the radial artery (transradial access via the wrist) to reach the coronary arteries (blood vessels supplying the heart) for the diagnosis or treatment of coronary artery disease? 
Background 
Coronary artery disease contributes to half of deaths caused by cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) disease. Restoration of adequate blood flow through the coronary arteries can be achieved by introducing a catheter through a peripheral artery. This allows the introduction of balloons through the aorta (major artery of the heart) to dilate coronary artery narrowing or place arterial scaffolds (tubes called stents) to keep the coronary arteries open. Two main peripheral arteries can provide access; traditionally, the femoral (groin) artery, and more recently, the radial artery (one of two major arteries in the forearm). While gaining popularity, the transradial approach can be more challenging than the transfemoral approach, which may translate to longer procedural durations and technical failures. In addition, this raises concerns regarding radiation exposure to patients and physicians being higher with the transradial approach. We sought to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to help inform healthcare decisions. 
Study characteristics 
Our search yielded 31 eligible studies comparing the transradial approach to the transfemoral approach in people undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic (or both) coronary catheterisation procedures in different settings, whether urgent (during heart attacks (myocardial infarctions)) or elective (planned procedure). The trials were carried out in many countries and regions, including Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and USA. We also identified two ongoing studies. The evidence was current to October 2017.
