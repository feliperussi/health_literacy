Phosphate binders to prevent complications of chronic kidney disease
What is the issue? 
People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a reduction in their capacity to remove phosphate from the body via the kidneys, so that phosphate levels in the blood and in body tissues increase as kidney function decreases. This may lead to the development of deposits comprised of calcium plus phosphate in blood vessels and other tissues, together with damage to the skeleton, worsening of kidney failure and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, bone pain, fractures, and death. 
Phosphate binders are often prescribed with meals to people with kidney disease, with the intention of reducing the absorption of dietary phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. 
What did we do? This review asked whether phosphate binders influence damage to blood vessels and soft tissues, skeletal changes, kidney function, and risks of cardiovascular disease, bone pain, fractures, and death that accompany worsening kidney failure. We included all clinical studies in which people with CKD were given different phosphate binders (by random chance) for at least eight weeks. We also checked the quality of the information in the studies to learn how certain we could be about the results. 
What did we find? 
We identified 104 studies of phosphate binders that included 13,744 people. Some studies gave treatment for only eight weeks while some studies treated participants for three years. People in the studies had a range of kidney function, and many were on dialysis. Overall we could not be certain of a number of important outcomes because many of the clinical studies we included had important flaws in their design. 
Sevelamer treatment may have decreased death for those patients given this medication when taken instead of calcium. The phosphate binders probably caused constipation, but we could not be very certain about the risks of other side‐effects. We were not very certain whether phosphate binders reduced heart complications, stroke, bone pain, or calcification of blood vessels. 
Conclusions 
Overall, we are not very sure whether specific phosphate binders are beneficial to patients with CKD. There is a possibility that sevelamer may prevent death compared to calcium‐based binders, but we don't know whether this may be caused by an increased risk of calcium‐based binders, a lower risk with sevelamer treatment, or the possibility that both may be true. Patients need to know that it is not certain whether phosphate binders help to prevent complications of kidney disease, but sevelamer may be preferred to calcium binders. 
We did not find differences in the effects of treatment for patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis, although most studies evaluating treatment with calcium‐based binders were among dialysis patients and those comparing binders with placebo were among people not treated with dialysis.
