Methods for monitoring blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes to improve outcomes
What is the issue and why is this important? 
If a mother already has diabetes when she becomes pregnant, she and her baby are at higher risk of various problems. Women with existing diabetes that is not well‐controlled at conception and in the first three months of pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage, having a baby with developmental problems or stillbirth. The baby is also at increased risk of developing diabetes in childhood. Problems for mothers include developing high blood pressure and associated ill‐health, early births, large babies, difficult births and the need for caesarean section. During labour the baby is at increased risk of a shoulder becoming stuck (shoulder dystocia) and of bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage). After birth the baby is more likely to have low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), jaundice and breathing problems. This means they are more likely to be admitted to intensive care. During pregnancy, the mother will have her blood glucose (sugar) levels monitored so appropriate steps can be taken to control her blood sugar. 
Several methods of monitoring blood glucose are used, including regular testing at antenatal clinics and self‐monitoring by women at home. The timing varies, such as monitoring before meals versus monitoring after meals, and how often levels are measured. For continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), technologies are used to transfer information directly from the woman to her clinician and include telemedicine (telephone and video systems, information technology) and digital technologies (mobile phones, tablets). The aim of these methods is to provide a more accurate measure of blood sugar levels so that they can be more effectively controlled, in order to reduce potential problems.
