Sulthiame as add‐on therapy for epilepsy
Review question 
A team of Cochrane researchers investigated how well sulthiame worked when it was used as an add‐on antiepileptic medicine (medicines that reduce seizures) in people with any type of epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological (brain) condition that is characterised by repeated seizures. Most people respond well to conventional antiepileptic medicines, however, about 30% continue to have seizures. These people are said to have drug‐resistant epilepsy. 
Sulthiame is an antiepileptic drug that is used widely in some European countries and in Israel. Sometimes it is used as an additional (add‐on) antiepileptic medicine for people with epilepsy, alongside an existing antiepileptic medicine. 
Main results 
Randomised controlled trials produce the most reliable evidence for medicines. The team searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials that compared sulthiame as an add‐on therapy to add‐on placebo (an inactive, dummy drug), or another antiepileptic medicine. 
The researchers found one relevant trial that included 37 infants, aged from three to 15 months, who had a diagnosis of West syndrome, a type of epilepsy. This trial was funded by DESITIN Pharma (Germany). All infants were started on an antiepileptic medicine, pyridoxine, three days before they added sulthiame or placebo. The infants' parents did not know which add‐on therapy their children received. The trial lasted for nine days. 
Very uncertain evidence from the trial suggests that sulthiame may stop seizures in people with West syndrome whose seizures do not stop with pyridoxine. Thirty per cent more infants had their seizures stop when they received add‐on sulthiame (6/20 participants) compared to add‐on placebo (0/17 participants). This difference was not statistically significant, mainly because there were so few infants included in the trial. 
The same number of infants experienced one or more adverse effects in both groups (9 in each). More infants experienced somnolence (drowsiness) when they received add‐on sulthiame (4/20), compared to those who received add‐on placebo (1/17), but again, this was not statistically significant. 
The small number of infants in the trial, and its short duration, means that we are not confident that the results are reliable. 
Further randomised controlled trials are required before meaningful conclusions can be drawn about how well sulthiame works as an add‐on therapy in West syndrome and other types of epilepsy, and to establish whether it produces any serious unwanted or harmful effects. 
The evidence is current to January 2019.
