Treatment methods for people with pancreatic pseudocysts (fluid collections around the pancreas) 
Review question 
How should people with pancreatic pseudocysts be treated?
Background 
The pancreas is an abdominal organ that secretes several digestive enzymes (substances that enable and speed up chemical reactions in the body) into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also contains the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones, including insulin (that helps to regulate blood sugar). Pancreatic pseudocysts are fluid collections around the pancreas. They arise due to sudden or long‐standing inflammation of the pancreas. While some will disappear when the inflammation of the pancreas settles down, others remain and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, indigestion, vomiting, and weight loss. Treatments of pancreatic pseudocysts include conservative treatment (watchful monitoring), surgical drainage, which can be performed through a standard cut (open surgical drainage) or by key‐hole surgery (laparoscopic surgical drainage), or endoscopic drainage. In endoscopic drainage, a tube (stent) is inserted with the help of an endoscope (a tube passed through the mouth into the stomach, usually to visualise the abdominal organs from inside the body), that connects the pseudocyst to the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. The insertion may be further helped by using an endoscopic ultrasound (an ultrasound probe attached to the endoscope; EUS‐guided drainage). Endoscopic ultrasound‐guided drainage may be further assisted by passing a tube through the nose and inserting it into the cyst during EUS‐guided drainage (EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage). The best way to treat pancreatic pseudocysts is not clear. We sought to resolve this by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised controlled trials whose results were reported up to 8 September 2015. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we used advanced methods, which allow individual comparison of the different treatments compared in the trials (indirect comparison). 
Study characteristics 
We included four trials, with 177 participants, in the review, 176 of whom were included in the analyses. The treatments compared in the four trials included endoscopic drainage (without EUS guidance), EUS‐guided drainage, EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage, and open surgical drainage. The participants were mostly people with pancreatic pseudocysts resulting from sudden onset or long‐term inflammation of the pancreas, from different causes. 
Key results 
One death occurred in the endoscopic drainage group, due to bleeding. The differences in the serious complications were imprecise. Short‐term health‐related quality of life (HRQoL; four weeks to three months) was worse, and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage group. There were fewer complications of any severity (such as bleeding) that required additional treatment in the EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage alone or endoscopic drainage groups. Those who received EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage also had a shorter hospital stay compared to those who received EUS‐guided drainage alone, endoscopic drainage, or open surgical drainage. Those who received EUS‐guided drainage alone had shorter hospital stays than those with open surgical drainage. There was a higher need for additional invasive treatments to completely drain the pseudocyst with endoscopic drainage than EUS‐guided drainage alone. The differences for the other comparisons were imprecise. None of the trials reported long‐term deaths, medium‐term or long‐term HRQoL, time‐to‐return to normal activities, or time‐to‐return to work.
