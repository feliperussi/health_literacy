Methods to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements for liver transplantation
The liver is the powerhouse of the body. It acts as a store of energy and a centre of metabolic activity. Liver transplantation is the main treatment for severe liver disease resulting in destruction of the liver (which can happen suddenly or over a period of time) due to various causes including alcoholism, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure and is associated with significant loss of blood. Various methods have been used to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation, with a view to improve the results of liver transplantation. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (available until September 2011) to determine the benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only, as when conducted properly such studies provide the best evidence. Two authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials. 
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 8 to 209. The comparisons included various drugs that affect the blood clotting (congealing) such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid; blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood); use of thromboelastography (a bedside measure of blood clot formation); and lowering the pressure in the veins with an aim to decrease the blood loss from veins. We found no significant difference in the risk of death or graft loss, or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There does not appear to be any consistency in the results between blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, low central venous pressure, and thromboelastography may lower blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, these findings are based on few trials with a high risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefits) and high risk of play of chance (random error due to small number of patients). There were no differences in the hospital stay or intensive care unit stay in any of the comparisons. Nor was there any significant difference in the intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the compared groups. Again, most of the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance). 
Aprotinin is a drug which has been withdrawn from market since there was a suspicion that it increased death after major heart operations. The results from this review do not reveal any increased mortality with aprotinin in the liver transplantation setting although one has to interpret this information with caution because of the few patients included in the trial. We are unable to advocate or refute any method of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.
