Surgical removal of the womb and fallopian tubes compared to surgical removal of the womb without fallopian tubes for ovarian cancer prevention 
Review question 
Cochrane researchers reviewed the evidence for the effect of surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy) together with the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) versus hysterectomy without salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention. 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is the deadliest form of cancer of the female reproductive system. Screening for ovarian cancer is not effective, so preventive measures are needed. From previous studies, we learned that most types of ovarian cancer arise in the fallopian tubes. For that reason, the removal of the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) during hysterectomy could lower the risk of ovarian cancer. The fallopian tubes have no function after completion of childbearing and salpingectomy is simple to perform. 
Because salpingectomy is a preventive measure, it should not have serious side effects or risks. When considering possible risks of salpingectomy, it might lead to a higher complication rate because an extra surgical step has to be performed. Another possible risk could be an earlier onset of menopause. The ovaries and fallopian tubes lie close together and, in part, share their blood supply. Surgery to the fallopian tube could thus damage part of the blood supply to the ovaries. This damage could result in an earlier age of menopause. Ovarian reserve can be measured with the concentration of Anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) in the blood. As women get older and come closer to menopause, the AMH concentration decreases. 
To investigate the effectiveness and safety of salpingectomy for prevention of ovarian cancer, we compared the risks and benefits of hysterectomy with salpingectomy to hysterectomy without salpingectomy. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven randomised controlled trials comparing hysterectomy with salpingectomy to hysterectomy without salpingectomy. They included a total of 350 women undergoing a hysterectomy for benign conditions of the female reproductive tract. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
We found no studies that reported ovarian cancer incidence after hysterectomy with salpingectomy to hysterectomy without salpingectomy. 
The number of complications that occur after hysterectomy is generally very low. This means that only a few complications occurred in the trials included in this review and we were unable to make a good comparison of complication rates.
