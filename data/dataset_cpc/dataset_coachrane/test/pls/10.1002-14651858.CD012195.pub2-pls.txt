Oral corticosteroid treatment started by patients or parents during a severe asthma attack 
Background 
Asthma is a long‐term inflammatory disease of the airways affecting around 334 million people worldwide. During severe asthma attacks, people may need to visit a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with corticosteroids, which may be given directly into a vein or by mouth. Some people with asthma are provided with oral steroids that they can take themselves (patient‐initiated) or give to their child (parent‐initiated) in the event of a severe asthma attack. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common. 
Review question 
We looked for studies comparing a) patient‐ or parent‐initiated oral steroids with b) no patient‐ or parent‐oral steroids (e.g. patient attends a medical centre or emergency department for further treatment by a doctor or nurse). The studies had to include either adults aged 18 years or older, or children of school age aged 5 years or older. Two review authors screened the search results independently of each other. The initial search was performed in May 2016. 
Results 
We screened 61 studies in total but we found no studies matching the above criteria. Five studies were excluded because the design of the studies was not allowed according to our review protocol. Two of these studies asked the correct clinical question but these studies were excluded because they used a type of trial design that was not allowed according to our review protocol. 
Conclusions 
There is currently a lack of evidence whether the use of patient‐ or parent‐initiated oral steroids is safe or has a beneficial treatment effect in patients with asthma. This is a concern because this approach to treatment is becoming more common.
