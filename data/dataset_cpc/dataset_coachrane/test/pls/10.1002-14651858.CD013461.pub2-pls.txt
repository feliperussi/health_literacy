Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions
Depression is common in adults with long‐term physical conditions. Long‐term physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic respiratory conditions, can impact on mental health. Mental health problems can also affect how people cope with a physical condition. Behavioural activation is a type of talking therapy used to treat depression in adults and it could be an alternative to other psychological therapies or medication. This review assesses the effects of behavioural activation on depression for people with long‐term physical conditions. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation with adults who were diagnosed with depression and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or a chronic respiratory condition. An RCT is a study with a control group, in which participants are allocated to the treatment and control groups at random. We searched a variety of online databases, including regional databases and trial registries. The search, conducted on 4 October 2019, identified 6066 records. After screening records, we included two studies in this review and 181 participants contributed data to the analyses. 
Both studies recruited participants from US hospitals. One study included participants recovering from a stroke and the other included women with breast cancer. In both studies, participants received behavioural activation delivered in eight weekly, face‐to‐face sessions. One study compared behavioural activation with poststroke treatment as usual, while the other compared behavioural activation with problem‐solving therapy, a talking therapy. 
Low to moderate‐certainty evidence suggested that behavioural activation may be more effective in the treatment of depression than included comparators, but these estimates were imprecise and effects were reduced in the longer term. There was no evidence of any differences between groups in the number of people who dropped out of the studies, depression symptoms, quality of life, physical functioning, or anxiety symptoms. The studies did not report on side effects during the study period. 
There were several limitations to the included studies. In both studies, participants were aware of the treatment they received. Also, researchers were involved in the design of the intervention in both studies, and may, therefore, have had an interest in a favourable outcome for behavioural activation. In one study, missing data caused by participants dropping out of the study may have influenced results. 
We did not find enough evidence in this review to know whether behavioural activation should be used to treat depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions.
