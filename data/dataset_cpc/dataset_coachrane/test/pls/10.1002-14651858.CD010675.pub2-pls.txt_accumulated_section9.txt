Surgical treatment options (microfracture, drilling, mosaicplasty, and allograft transplantation) for cartilage injuries of the knee in adults 
What is the medical problem? 
The layer of cartilage covering the knee joint surfaces helps protect the joint and reduce friction during movement. Cartilage injuries of the knee in adults can result from trauma, such as during sport, or from a cartilage disease (osteochondritis). If left untreated, cartilage injuries do not mend by themselves and can lead to significant destruction of the joint (osteoarthritis). 
What treatments are available? 
A number of treatment options are available for cartilage injuries but are often aimed at treating symptoms such as pain rather than providing a cure. Non‐surgical methods, such as physical therapy, may relieve symptoms but cannot heal cartilage injuries. Microfracture, drilling, mosaicplasty, and allograft transplantation are increasingly available surgical treatments that attempt to preserve the joint. 
What are microfracture, drilling, mosaicplasty, and allograft transplantation? 
Microfracture and drilling are minimally invasive surgeries (key hole surgery) that promote bleeding from the bone to create a clot in the cartilage defect. This can then form a tissue similar to cartilage. Mosaicplasty is an osteochondral transplant in which tissue is harvested from a less‐demanding area of the knee to cover a cartilage defect in a more important area. Allograft transplantation treatment uses tissue harvested from fresh cadavers to cover only the injured area. 
Which of these surgical techniques works better in practice? 
This review examines the evidence from randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of these surgical methods in clinical practice.
