Antifibrinolytic agents to reduce blood loss in the surgical correction of scoliosis (abnormal curvatures of the spine) in children 
Background 
Scoliosis is a curving of the spine beyond that which is normal. Surgery may be needed to correct scoliosis and is often carried out when the child is young. Substantial bleeding may occur during surgery and can lead to serious complications, such as multiple organ failure. Many methods are used to reduce blood loss, including drugs that modify clotting pathways in the body. Medications known as antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of a blood clot. This review is an update of a review published in 2008, which looked at how well these drugs work, and how safe they are.

Study characteristics 
The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo. 
Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy. 
Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow‚Äêup ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital. 
Study funding sources 
Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding.
