Dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious complication of severe liver disease. The disease is often fluctuating with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from minor, not readily discernible signs to deep coma. Symptoms often develop in connection to stress related to infection, dehydration, obstipation, or gastrointestinal bleeding. The exact underlying mechanisms behind the disease development are not known. Experimental studies suggest that the mental changes seen in hepatic encephalopathy reflect changes in neurotransmitters in the brain. 
Dopamine plays a major role in neurotransmission. Several nervous system diseases including Parkinson's disease are caused by a dysfunction in the dopamine system. Some patients with hepatic encephalopathy have symptoms that are similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (slow cerebration; stiffness of movements; tremor). For patients with Parkinson's disease, the drugs known as dopamine agents (drugs that mimic the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine) clearly alleviate symptoms. These drugs have also been assessed for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. 
We performed the present systematic review to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Our analyses included five small trials published in 1982 or earlier. All trials but one had high risks of bias (i.e., risks of systematic errors or risks of overestimation of beneficial effects or risks of underestimation of harmful effects). Only 144 patients were included in the five trials, and accordingly risks of random errors (i.e., play of chance) are present. Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy or mortality in patients treated with dopamine agents compared with patients who received an inactive placebo or no intervention. The number of patients with adverse events seemed comparable in the two intervention groups. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that no evidence can be found to recommend or refute the use of dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy. More randomised placebo‚Äêcontrolled clinical trials without risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors seem necessary to obtain firm evidence on dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
