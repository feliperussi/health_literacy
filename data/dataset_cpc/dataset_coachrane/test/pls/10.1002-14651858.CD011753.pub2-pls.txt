A 'test and treat' strategy for elevated wound protease activity for healing in venous leg ulcers 
What are venous leg ulcers? 
Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic wound. Compression therapy (bandages or stockings) is used to treat venous leg ulcers. Dressings which aim to protect the wound and provide an environment that will help it to heal are used underneath compression. Protease‐modulating dressings are one of several types of dressing available. 
Why use a test and treat strategy for venous leg ulcers? 
Wounds that are slower to heal are thought to have higher levels of proteases (enzymes that break down proteins). Protease‐modulating dressings are designed to lower protease activity and help wounds to heal. A test to detect high levels of protease activity has also been introduced. A 'test and treat' strategy involves testing for elevated proteases and then using protease‐modulating treatments in ulcers which show elevated protease levels. It is important to know if using both the test and the treatment together can improve healing of leg ulcers. 
What we found 
In January 2016 we searched for as many relevant studies as possible that were randomised controlled trials, and which compared a 'test and treat' strategy with another treatment in people with venous leg ulcers. We did not find any eligible randomised studies. We found one ongoing study which might be relevant but could not obtain any more information on this. Research is still needed to find out if it is helpful to test venous leg ulcers for high levels of protease activity and then treat high levels using protease‐modulating treatments. This review is part of a set of reviews investigating different aspects of using protease‐modulating treatments in people with venous leg ulcers.
