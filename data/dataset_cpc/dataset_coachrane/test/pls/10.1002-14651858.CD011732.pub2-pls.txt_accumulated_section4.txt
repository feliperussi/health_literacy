Does tranexamic acid given before an operation reduce blood loss for women with advanced ovarian cancer? 
The issue: Cytoreductive surgery (also called debulking) is a standard surgical procedure for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. During surgery, the aim is to remove not only the ovaries, but also the uterus, fallopian tubes, and as much of the visible tumour as possible. Blood loss during cytoreductive surgery has long been recognised as a contributor to prolonged recovery time. 
The aim of the review: We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss during cytoreductive surgery in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. We searched for scientific research studies up to May 2015 and found only one randomised controlled trial ‒ considered the gold standard for study design ‒ that assessed a single dose of tranexamic acid given intravenously before the start of surgery versus a placebo in women undergoing cytoreductive surgery for clinically suspected advanced advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. 
What are the main findings and conclusion? Although tranexamic acid did numerically reduce blood loss, there was no clinical benefit, as the difference in blood loss was minimal, and there was no difference in need for blood transfusion, suggesting that this level of blood loss did not make a difference to the patient's well‐being. Additionally, there was incomplete and limited evidence regarding tranexamic acid‐related adverse events, so we can say little about whether tranexamic acid is safe for women with advanced ovarian cancer. The evidence we found from a single study was therefore insufficient to support routinely giving prophylactic tranexamic acid for cytoreductive surgery. This review indicates the need for future good quality, well‐designed randomised controlled trials to provide more evidence on the effectiveness, safety and appropriate administration of tranexamic acid.
