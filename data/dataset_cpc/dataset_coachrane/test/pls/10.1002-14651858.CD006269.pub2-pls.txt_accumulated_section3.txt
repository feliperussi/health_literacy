Hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. 
In the past decades, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy followed by surgery has become standard treatment for advanced rectal cancer. Chemotherapy is often added, because it enhances the effect of radiotherapy. Another method to amplify radiotherapy is heating the tumor (hyperthermia). In larger tumours there are often regions with a low oxygen concentration. Low oxygen concentrations may hamper the effect of radiotherapy. Hyperthermia can overcome this problem and is able to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. This systematic review of the literature was done to study the additional value of hyperthermia if added to radiotherapy in advanced rectal cancer, 
Six studies were found in which 520 patients were included. Of them 258 patients were treated with radiotherapy only and 262 with the combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Four of the six studies containing 424 patients reported overall survival rates (i.e. also patients who died from other causes than cancer were reported). Overall survival after 2 years was significantly better in the group treated with the combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy, but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 years). Five studies reported complete remission rates, i.e. a complete disappearance of the tumour. The chance to develop a complete remission was significantly higher in the combined treated patient group. Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity (that is in general any adverse effect that develops within 3 months during and after treatment). In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between both treatment groups. Late toxicity data (adverse effects that developed during the years following treatment) were not reported.
