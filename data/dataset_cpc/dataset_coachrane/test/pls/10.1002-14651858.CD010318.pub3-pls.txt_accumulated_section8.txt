Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus
What was the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about whether or not negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is effective in treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found 11 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether NPWT is effective for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. There is some low‐certainty evidence that NPWT increases the number of wounds healed compared with dressings, and may reduce the time it takes wounds to heal. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of different pressures of NPWT on wound healing. Overall, the reliability of the evidence provided by the trials is too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of NPWT for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. 
What did the review study? 
Diabetes mellitus is a common condition that leads to high blood glucose (blood sugar) concentrations, with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Some people with diabetes can develop ulcers on their feet. These wounds can take a long time to heal, they can be painful and become infected. Ulceration of the foot in people with diabetes can also lead to a higher risk of amputation of parts of the foot or leg. Generally, people with diabetes are at a higher risk of lower‐limb amputation than people without diabetes. 
NPWT is a treatment currently being used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. Worldwide, the use of NPWT is increasing. However, it is expensive compared with wound treatments such as dressings.
