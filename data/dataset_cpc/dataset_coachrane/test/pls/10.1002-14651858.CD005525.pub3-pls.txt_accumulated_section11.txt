Zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
What are the effects of zinc supplementation compared with placebo or no treatment for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in adults with insulin resistance? 
Background 
Some studies have shown that zinc improves glucose levels (glycaemic control) in people with diabetes. As a consequence of diabetes long‐term complications may develop, such as kidney, nerve and eye disease. Also, the risk of cardiovascular complications like heart attacks and strokes is raised. Type 1 diabetes is a form of diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin any more. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity and lack of physical activity and is characterised by an increasing inability of the body to make good use of insulin (insulin resistance). The mineral zinc plays a key role in the action of insulin and theoretically zinc supplementation used by people with insulin resistance could prevent the onset of diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We included three randomised controlled studies with a total of 128 participants in this review. The duration of zinc supplementation ranged between four and 12 weeks. 
Key results 
No study reported on our patient‐important key outcomes (new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, side effects, health‐related quality of life, all‐cause mortality, diabetic complications, socioeconomic effects). The effects of zinc supplementation are uncertain regarding insulin resistance and lipid levels in the blood (mainly cholesterol and triglycerides). 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of the included studies was unclear because study authors did not provide important information for us to judge how the studies were performed (unclear risk of bias in most cases). In addition, the number of studies and participants is low and the study authors did not investigate important outcomes such as new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus or side effects of zinc supplementation.
