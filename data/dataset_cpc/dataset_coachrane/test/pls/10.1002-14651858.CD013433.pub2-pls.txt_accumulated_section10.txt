Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information.
