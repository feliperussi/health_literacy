Extended treatment for 72 weeks versus standard treatment for 48 weeks in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected slow responders 
Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver‐related morbidity and mortality. The standard length of treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin for hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infected patients is 48 weeks, but the number of patients who are treated successfully with regard to disappearance of the virus from the blood (sustained virological response) is limited. In order to improve it, extending the length of the treatment period has been suggested. We attempted to identify whether extending treatment duration to 72 weeks is better than the standard 48 weeks in a subgroup of patients who have shown a slow viral response. 
We found seven randomised clinical trials that compared a treatment duration of 72 weeks with 48 weeks in 1369 participants. The quality of all trials was low. Mortality and liver‐related morbidity were not reported in any of the included trials. Sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA after six months from the end of an entire course of treatment) was increased when the decision to prolong treatment was taken based on viral load after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.92) as well as when the decision to prolong treatment was taken based on the results of the viral load after four weeks of treatment (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50). The calculated number needed to treat to achieve an increase in sustained virological response proportions was nine (meaning that among nine participants treated for 72 weeks instead of 48 weeks, only one more will achieve a sustained virological response compared to the participants treated for 48 weeks). The higher sustained virological response after 72 weeks of treatment was caused by a reduction in the number of patients in this group who experienced a virological relapse after treatment. Adherence to treatment was not different between the two groups. Serious adverse events were mentioned in only one trial, and they were not different in the two treatment groups. The findings may be influenced by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and the risk of random errors (play of chance). 
Further large‐scale, randomised trials with reporting of patient relevant outcomes are warranted.
