Decision aids for people deciding about taking part in clinical trials
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of specific tools, called decision aids, which aim to improve decision making in the informed consent process for people who are considering participating in a clinical trial. These tools were compared to the standard process used for informed consent in clinical trials. There is currently not enough evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of decision aids in the informed consent process for clinical trials. 
In clinical trials, one healthcare treatment is compared to another treatment or to no treatment. Before potential participants sign a consent form where they agree to take part in a clinical trial they must be given information about what will be expected of them and what they can expect. Research has shown that this information is often not as good as it could be. For example, people often misunderstand the information they have been given. Decision aids, which are tools that assist people to think about what matters most to them, support decision making for treatment and screening. Presenting information about trial participation through decision aids might improve the informed consent process by improving participants' knowledge, certainty with the decision and enabling them to consider what matters most to them personally. 
We searched the literature for studies where potential trial participants were randomly allocated to receive decision aids, compared to no decision aids or to other types of information for informed consent. We found one study, which reported data from two separate decision aid trials, where people who were given a decision aid alongside standard information were compared to people who were given standard information alone. When data from these two trials were combined, the results were inconclusive and not able to show whether people given the decision aid had any more or less knowledge or uncertainty about their decision, or were more or less likely to participate in a trial, than the people who were only given standard information. However, people who used the decision aid may have felt less regret about their decision. Overall there was very low quality evidence to support these findings, which means that there may be uncertainty around the results, and therefore, further research is required.
