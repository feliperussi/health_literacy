Bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis caused by the use of steroids
Background 
Steroids (glucocorticosteroids) are widely used to treat inflammation. Bone loss (osteoporosis) and spinal fractures are serious side effects of this therapy. Bisphosphonates are considered a first‐line treatment for osteoporosis and have been used since the 1990s. 
Methods 
We examined the research published up to April 2016 and found a total of 27 eligible trials, which included 3075 adults with inflammatory diseases that required steroid treatment for at least one year. People were randomly assigned to receive either bisphosphonate treatment (alone or with calcium or vitamin D, or both) or 'no treatment' (given calcium or vitamin D or a placebo). Our objective was to determine the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for adults on long‐term steroid therapy. 
Main Results 
New spinal fractures (12 to 24 months) 
There were 12 trials with 1343 people for this analysis. We found that 77 per 1000 people with no treatment experienced new spinal fracture compared to 44 per 1000 (range 27 to 70) people taking bisphosphonates; an absolute benefit of 2% fewer people (5% fewer to 1% more) sustaining spinal fractures when taking bisphosphonates. 
Approximately 31 people (range 20 to 145) would need to be treated with bisphosphonates to prevent spinal fractures in one person. 
New non‐spinal fractures (12 to 24 months) 
There were nine trials with 1245 people for this analysis. We found that 55 per 1000 people with no treatment experienced new non‐spinal fractures compared to 42 per 1000 (range 25 to 69) people taking bisphosphonates; an absolute benefit of 1% fewer people (4% fewer to 1% more) sustaining non‐spinal fractures when taking bisphosphonates. 
Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months 
There were 23 trials with 2042 people for this outcome. We found that the BMD of the lumbar spine of people taking bisphosphonates was 3.50% higher (2.90% to 4.10% higher) than in people who had no treatment.
