Drugs for preventing kidney disease in people with diabetes
Many people with diabetes (around 20% to 60%) are are affected by high blood pressure (hypertension) and need drugs (antihypertensive agents) to treat this condition. These drugs also help to prevent development of kidney disease both in people with diabetes who have normal blood pressure and those whose blood pressure is high. Many people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (20% to 40%) go on to develop end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), and many others die from heart disease or other circulatory problems before ESKD develops. 
We reviewed the literature to determine the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment in people with diabetes who did not have signs of kidney disease. We found 26 studies involving 61,264 participants that compared antihypertensive drugs with placebo (an neutral agent with no therapeutic benefits or harms), no treatment, and other antihypertensive drugs. A family of drugs called ACEi (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors) has been shown to prevent new onset of kidney disease and reduce the numbers of deaths in people with diabetes who have normal levels of albumin in their urine compared with placebo or calcium channel blocking drugs. We found no significant effect from angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs on either development of ESKD or death. 
Subgroup analyses that suggested similar benefits from ARB for people with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of heart disease or should be interpreted cautiously. Direct comparison of ACEi and ARB in this population showed no difference in preventing DKD. The benefits of ACEi are consistent, and ACEi could be the first choice intervention for primary prevention of DKD.
