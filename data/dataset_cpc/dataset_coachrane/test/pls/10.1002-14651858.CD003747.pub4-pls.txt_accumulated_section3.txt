Heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in acutely ill medical patients (excluding those with stroke or myocardial infarction) 
Blood clots may form in the veins of patients who are admitted to hospital suffering from an acute medical illness. These types of blood clots are referred to as deep vein thromboses (DVT) and they may break free from the blood vessel wall and travel to the lungs and cause death, at which point they are referred to as a pulmonary embolism (PE). These types of blood clots and their prevention have been thoroughly studied in surgical patients but not as much in non‐surgical, medical patients, who make up a greater proportion of hospital patients. Medical patients differ from surgical patients with regard to their health, the progression of clots and the impact that preventative measures can have. The extensive experience from clot prevention studies in surgical patients is therefore not necessarily applicable to non‐surgical patients. 
Heparin is a blood thinning drug, which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of blood clots in patients after they have had surgery. Heparin exists in two forms, the original unfractionated (UFH) form and a newer form called low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The aim of the current review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of heparin (UFH or LMWH) to prevent DVTs and PEs in non‐surgical, medical patients admitted to hospital, excluding those admitted to hospital with a heart attack or stroke or those requiring admission to an intensive care unit. The outcomes investigated in this review were DVT, PE that did not cause death, PE that resulted in death, combined non‐fatal and fatal PE, all‐cause death, bleeding complications and thrombocytopaenia, which is a condition that can be caused by heparin and results in decreased platelets in the blood.
