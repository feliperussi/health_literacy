Pulse oximetry for diagnosis of critical congenital heart defects
Review question 
We reviewed evidence on the accuracy of pulse oximetry for detection of critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in asymptomatic newborn infants. 
Background 
CCHDs occur in around two in 1000 newborn infants and are a leading cause of infant death. Timely diagnosis is crucial for best outcomes for these babies, but current screening methods may miss up to 50% of affected newborn infants before birth, and those sent home before diagnosis frequently die or endure major morbidity. However, babies with CCHD often have low blood oxygen levels, which can be detected quickly and non‐invasively by pulse oximetry, using a sensor placed on the newborn infant’s hand or foot. A pulse oximeter is a machine that can measure, non‐invasively, the amount of oxygen carried around the body by red blood cells. Oxygen from the lungs is bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming oxyhemoglobin. If oxygen is not bound, de‐oxyhemoglobin is formed. In health, almost all hemoglobin is oxyhemoglobin, and so oxygen saturation (ie, the percentage of hemoglobin that has bound oxygen) is close to 100%. The pulse oximeter measures this by passing light through peripheral blood vessels (eg, a fingertip in an adult, in a hand or foot in a baby). Oxyhemoglobin and de‐oxyhemoglobin absorb this light in different ways, and the proportion of light absorbed can be analyzed by software within the oximeter, which then calculates the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. 
Study characteristics 
We searched until March 2017 for evidence on use of pulse oximetry to detect CCHD in newborn infants and found 21 studies. These studies used different thresholds to define a pulse oximetry test as positive. We combined all studies using a threshold around 95% (19 studies with 436,758 newborn infants). 
Key results 
This review found that for every 10,000 apparently healthy newborn infants screened, around six of them will have CCHD. The pulse oximetry test will correctly identify five of these newborn infants with CCHD (but will miss one case). Newborn infants who are missed could die or experience major morbidity. 
For every 10,000 apparently healthy newborn infants screened, 9994 will not have CCHD. The pulse oximetry test will correctly identify 9980 of them (but 14 newborn infants will be investigated for suspected CCHD). Some of these infants may be exposed to unnecessary additional tests and a prolonged hospital stay, but a proportion will have a potentially serious non‐cardiac illness. 
The number of newborn infants incorrectly investigated for CCHD decreases when pulse oximetry is performed longer than 24 hours after birth.
