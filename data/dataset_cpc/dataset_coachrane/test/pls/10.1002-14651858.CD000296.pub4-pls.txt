Budesonide for treatment of people with active Crohn's disease.
What is Crohn's disease?  Crohn's disease is a debilitating long‐term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, non‐bloody diarrhea and weight loss. The most common initial treatment of the Crohn's disease is oral steroid therapy. Unfortunately, traditional steroids are usually absorbed into the body and cause significant unwanted side effects. These may include but are not limited to weight gain, diabetes, growth retardation, acne, mood instability, and high blood pressure. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’; periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What is budesonide?  Budesonide is a steroid that is quickly metabolized by the liver thereby reducing corticosteroid‐related side effects. 
What did the researchers investigate?  The researchers investigated whether budesonide produces remission in people with active Crohn's disease; and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 12, 2014. 
What did the researchers find?  The researchers identified 14 studies that included a total of 1805 participants. Nine studies (779 participants) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three studies (535 participants) compared budesonide to a placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), and two studies (491 participants) compared budesonide to mesalamine (an anti‐inflammatory drug composed of 5‐aminosalicylic acid). Ten studies were judged to be of high quality. Four studies were judged to be of low quality. 
Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission. An increase in side effects was not seen with budesonide compared to placebo. Withdrawals due to disease worsening were similar in budesonide and placebo groups. Budesonide patients were more likely than placebo patients to experience adrenal suppression a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. 
Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission in people with Crohn's disease. However, fewer side effects occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function. 
One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease whereas another study found no difference in remission rates. 
The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5‐aminosalicylic products. Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although budesonide is less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission the likelihood of side effects and adrenal suppression is lower than with conventional steroids.
