Laparoscopic application of heat or laser to the ovaries to cause ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who do not ovulate 
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effect of a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) compared with medical treatment to cause ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who do not ovulate. We also reviewed the effect of different LOD techniques. 
Background 
Women with PCOS have problems with ovulating and therefore may have difficulty becoming pregnant. In the past clomiphene citrate (CC) used to be the first‐line treatment in women with PCOS. Ovulation induction with letrozole should be the first‐line treatment according to new guidelines, but the use of letrozole is not officially approved. Consequently, clomiphene citrate is still commonly used. Approximately 20% of women on CC do not ovulate. When this occurs, we call it CC‐resistant PCOS. For women with CC‐resistant PCOS there are different medications available to induce ovulation, such as gonadotrophins, metformin or aromatase inhibitors, but these medications are not always successful and can cause adverse events like multiple pregnancies and cycle cancellation due to an excessive response. Another option for treatment is a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). This involves applying heat or laser to the ovaries with a laparoscope (a camera) passed through a small cut, usually just below the belly button. This procedure is thought to improve the way the ovaries produce and respond to hormones, increasing the chance of ovulation. However, there are risks associated with surgery, such as complications from anaesthesia, infection, and adhesions. LOD is a surgical alternative to medical treatment, and this review aimed to determine its benefits and risks. 
Study characteristics 
In this updated review we included 38 controlled trials comparing LOD with medical ovulation induction or comparing different techniques of LOD. The evidence is current to October 2019
