Does hair removal before surgery prevent infections after surgery?
Key messages? 
Compared with no hair removal:
· there are probably more surgical site infections when hair is removed by shaving with a razor; 
· removing hair with clippers and cream may make little to no difference to the number of infections; 
Clippers and hair removal cream probably cause fewer infections than shaving using a razor. 
Removing hair on the day of, rather than the day before surgery may slightly reduce the number of infections. 
Why is hair removed before surgery? 
Before a surgical intervention, it is common to remove hair from the area of the body that is going to have surgery. Hair can be removed using different methods, including clippers, a razor, or hair removal cream. 
Hair is removed to avoid problems during and after surgery, for example when stitching up wounds or applying dressings. However, some studies claim that removing hair could cause infections after surgery and should be avoided. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if removing hair before surgery:
· causes or prevents infections;
· prevents wound complications, such as cuts to the skin or the opening up of stitched wounds; 
· has an impact on how long people stay in hospital after surgery; and
· has any cost implications.
We were also interested in whether some hair removal methods or times for hair removal are better than others. 
What did we do? 
First, we searched for studies that compared:
· hair removal against no removal; or
· different methods and times of hair removal.
We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 25 studies that involved a total of 8919 people.
Ten studies compared no hair removal against hair removal, using:
· clippers (3 studies);
· shaving with a razor (8 studies, 7 of which provided useable evidence); or
· hair removal cream (1 study).
Seven studies compared using a razor against using clippers, and 10 studies compared using a razor against using cream (nine of these 10 studies provided useable evidence). 
One study compared hair removal the day before surgery versus hair removal on the day of surgery. 
What does the evidence show? 
Hair removal compared to no hair removal 
· Hair removal with clippers and cream may make little to no difference to the number of surgical site infections. 
· Hair removal with a razor probably risks more infections than no hair removal.
Whether hair is removed with a razor or not removed may make little to no difference for length of hospital stay (1 study). 
Comparisons of different hair removal methods 
· Clippers probably cause fewer infections and skin injuries than razors.
· Cream probably causes fewer infections, and may cause fewer skin injuries, than razors. 
Time of hair removal 
Whether hair is removed on the day of surgery or the day before surgery may slightly reduce infection numbers (1 study). 
What do we still not know? 
Due to a lack of robust studies, we do not know:
· if removing hair affects wound complications and costs when compared to not removing hair; 
· if different hair removal methods have different effects on length of hospital stay, or on costs; and 
· if the time of hair removal affects wound complications, length of hospital stay, or costs. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019.
