Nipple‐ and areola‐sparing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of nipple‐sparing mastectomy (that is, removing the breast tissue but preserving the entire skin, nipple and areola) compared to traditional mastectomy (that is, removing the skin that overlies the breast including nipple and areola) or skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, removing the breast tissue including the breast and areola but preserving all the skin envelope). 
Background 
Traditional surgical therapy for breast cancer is mastectomy. A traditional mastectomy consists of the removal of the entire breast tissue and the nipple‐areola complex. The chance of cancer returning to the region of the mastectomy after this type of surgery is about 2.3% after 20 years. Rising interest in improving the cosmetic results has led to the introduction of nipple‐sparing mastectomy or areola‐sparing mastectomy as an alternative to conventional mastectomy. Nipple‐areola complex preservation results in higher psychological satisfaction and the perception of less mutilation among women. Nipple‐sparing mastectomy has been proposed for the treatment of breast cancer. This technique retains the entire natural envelope of the skin and areola complex, and aims to create an aesthetic result that is closer to the natural state than breast reconstruction techniques. The efficacy and effectiveness of nipple‐ and areola‐sparing mastectomy in the treatment of breast cancer is questionable. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to September 2014. We included 11 studies involving 6502 participants having 7018 surgical procedures (some participants had surgery on both breasts). Out of these, 2529 participants underwent nipple‐sparing mastectomy, while there were no participants who had an areola‐sparing mastectomy, 818 participants underwent skin‐sparing mastectomy and 3671 underwent a traditional mastectomy. All participants in the studies were women and most of them (99.2%) had invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. We compared nipple‐sparing mastectomy to conventional mastectomy and skin‐sparing mastectomy in two different analyses. 
Key results 
It was not possible to conclude whether or not survival following nipple‐sparing mastectomy was similar to traditional mastectomy and skin‐sparing mastectomy. Results were also inconclusive for differences in local recurrence and adverse events following different types of mastectomy. In practice the decision to select nipple‐sparing mastectomy over other types of mastectomy should be done through shared decision making after extensive discussion of the risks and benefits. Generally the nipple‐sparing mastectomy studies reported a favourable aesthetic result and a gain in quality of life compared with the other types of mastectomy. However, due to the lack of numerical data, it was not possible to pool the results of different studies.
