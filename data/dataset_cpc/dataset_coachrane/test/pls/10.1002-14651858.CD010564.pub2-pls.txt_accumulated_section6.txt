Metformin for women with obesity or who are overweight during pregnancy for improving health for women and their babies 
What is the issue? 
We examined whether metformin has a role in improving health outcomes for pregnant women with obesity or who are overweight, and their babies. We considered possible benefits, adverse effects and healthcare system costs. 
Body mass index (BMI), calculated from a person's height and weight, is used to classify someone as having normal weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m2), being overweight (BMI 24.9 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2) or having obesity (BMI above 30 kg/m2). Women with obesity or who are overweight are more likely than women of normal weight to experience complications like high blood pressure and gestational diabetes during pregnancy. They are also at increased risk of needing a caesarean or developing infection after birth. Their babies are more likely to experience health problems, requiring admission to the neonatal unit or intensive care, have low blood sugar, or problems breathing immediately after birth. 
Women with obesity or who are overweight may have some features of diabetes that may contribute to problems during pregnancy and birth. They may not process dietary carbohydrates and sugars efficiently, and are more likely to be resistant to the hormone insulin, released by the pancreas after eating, helping muscles use blood glucose (sugar) for energy. Glucose circulates in the blood for longer, providing excess energy to the growing baby. There is an increased risk of developing diabetes in pregnancy and women may have low levels of inflammatory hormones and proteins circulating in the body. Improving diet and increasing exercise have had a very small effect on reducing weight gain during pregnancy and no effect on complications. 
Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, reduces the amount of glucose the liver releases into the blood and makes the body more sensitive to insulin. Metformin may help a woman's body use insulin more effectively and reduce the chance that her baby will grow large‐for‐gestational age.
