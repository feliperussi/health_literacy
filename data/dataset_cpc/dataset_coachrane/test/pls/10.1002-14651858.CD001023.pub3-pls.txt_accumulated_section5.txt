Surgical shunts versus radiologic shunt for variceal haemorrhage in people with chronic disease of the liver 
Background 
Varices are enlarged thin walled vessels found in the walls of the oesophagus and stomach of people with high blood pressure in the portal circulation (blood vessels supplying the liver with blood from the bowels). Bleeding from varices are not uncommon and maybe life‐threatening. The first‐line treatment of this bleeding is with medications and endoscopy (use of a long tube fitted with camera to locate and occlude the varices with elastic bands). Most people will respond to the first‐line treatment, but a few will continue to bleed or have repeat bleeding. This later group will require further treatments in the form of shunts (tubes that divert blood from portal circulation direct to the heart). There are two types of shunts; one that is created through a surgical operation and called surgical shunt, the other is created with the help of an ultrasound machine and called radiologic shunt. Both types of shunts have their benefits and harms. This review was done to determine whether surgical shunts are better than radiologic shunt in treating persistent and repeat bleeding due to varices in people with cirrhosis (chronic disease of the liver in which normal liver cells are replaced by hard scar). 
Study characteristics 
We found four randomised clinical trials in which 496 adult participants were allowed to receive either a surgical shunt or a radiologic shunt. There were problems with the design of the trials as they had small number of participants and used different shunt types. We judged all four trials at high risk of bias (trials may have overestimated the true effect of shunts treatment).
