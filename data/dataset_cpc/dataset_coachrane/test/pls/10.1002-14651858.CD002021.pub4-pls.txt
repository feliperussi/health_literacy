Use of opioid antagonists with minimal sedation to manage opioid withdrawal
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, naloxone) plus minimal sedation for managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (for example, heroin or pharmaceutical opiates). 
Background 
Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for longer‐term treatments of opioid dependence. The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completing withdrawal difficult for most people. The rationale underlying the use of opioid antagonists to induce withdrawal is that a faster transition from dependence to abstinence might make completing withdrawal easier. This review considered the effects of treatment with opioid antagonists versus other approaches for withdrawal.

Study characteristics 
We identified 10 studies, including six randomised controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and four prospective cohort studies (where participants could choose which treatment they received) involving 955 opioid‐dependent participants. Four of the studies took place in the UK, three in the USA, two in Italy and one in Australia. Nine of the 10 studies compared treatment with an opioid antagonist (naltrexone or naloxone) plus an adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine) versus a regimen based on clonidine or lofexidine alone. Other comparisons (placebo, reducing doses of methadone, buprenorphine) made by included studies were too diverse for any meaningful analysis. 
Four studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether peak withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists plus clonidine or lofexidine is more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, or whether the average severity over the withdrawal period is less, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Clinicians should warn people of the possibility of delirium in the first day of administration of naltrexone, particularly with higher doses (> 25 mg). People should also know that withdrawal will be moderately severe and that symptoms such as muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhoea, and insomnia are likely to persist despite medication. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in this review were diverse and generally of very low quality. As a result there is considerable uncertainty about the value of approaches using opioid antagonists to induce opioid withdrawal as a means of managing withdrawal from opioid dependence.
