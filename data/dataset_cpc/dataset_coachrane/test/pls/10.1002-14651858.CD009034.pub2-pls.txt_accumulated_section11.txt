First‐line sequential versus standard triple therapies for Helicobacter pylori eradication
Review question 
To estimate the difference in cure rates between both treatments, and to identify factors that may improve or reduce the cure rate for both treatments. 
Background 
Gastric ulcer and cancer are mainly caused by infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, a harmful micro‐organism able to colonise the human stomach. Published data seem to indicate that this bacteria is present in nearly half of the world's population. The bacterial colonisation leads to a chronic infection that, over time, may alter the stomach's function, tissue structure, and even cell cycle, being able to produce a variety of symptoms and diseases. 
Although this micro‐organism may respond to traditional antibiotics, it has a strong resistance to treatment, and in a high percentage of cases can survive most single and double therapies. Different combinations of antibiotics have therefore been used, and the best treatment is still unclear. The most commonly recommended one is the standard triple therapy (STT), containing two antibiotics (clarithromycin, and a nitroimidazole or amoxicillin) and a stomach protector (omeprazole). However, several studies have demonstrated that STT fails in more than one in five people, so investigators proposed replacing it with a non‐bismuth quadruple sequential sequential (SEQ) treatment, containing a first phase with a dual therapy (amoxicillin and omeprazole), followed by a triple‐therapy phase (nitroimidazole, clarithromycin and omeprazole). 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases and conference abstracts to identify any relevant studies. We include 44 studies, which tested and compared the cure rates of SEQ therapy against STTs. Our review covers research up to April 2015. 
Key results 
The review indicates that before 2008 the cure rate for SEQ was higher than for STT. However, the cure rate of both treatments is lower than we would wish. The review found that effectiveness depended on several factors, including the geographic region of the study, bacterial resistance, and the date of the study. For example, we found a reduction in the cure rate over time in both STT and SEQ therapies, with a stronger reduction for SEQ. This meant that in the studies published after 2008, SEQ was not more effective than triple therapy when they were both given for 10 days. 
The evidence collected and combined in this review does not support the use of SEQ therapy, as its effectiveness can be matched and even improved on by better STTs (given for 10 or 14 days, or high acid inhibition). Results for SEQ were only partially successful. We need to find another form of therapy to provide the best treatment for patients.
