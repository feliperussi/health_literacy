Water infusion versus air insufflation for colonoscopy
Colonoscopy is a visual examination of the inner lining of the large intestine with a camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. Colonoscopy can provide a visual diagnosis of colorectal diseases. In particular, colonoscopies are an important tool in screening for colorectal cancer, and are the gold standard for the early detection of tumours and polyps located in the intestinal wall. Polyps may develop into colorectal cancer and a standard procedure is to remove these if identified, Colonoscopy allows the removal of polyps, sparing the need for open surgery. 
The degree of colorectal cancer protection offered by colonoscopy depends on the technical performance. For example, it is important that colonoscopy is performed through the whole length of the colon, allowing for examination of all the colonic segments. Another measure of the quality of a colonoscopy is whether it can detect a lesion in the colon, such as adenomas. 
Standard colonoscopy uses air insufflations to expand the lumen for better visualisation and facilitating advancement of the colonoscope through the large intestine. Recent clinical trials have proposed that using water instead of air insufflation may minimise patient discomfort and facilitate passage of the colonoscope through difficult segments of the large intestine. Moreover, water colonoscopy may remove residual faeces, thereby improving the view and the detection of adenomas. 
The purpose of this review was to compare the effectiveness of the novel water infusion colonoscopy with the standard air colonoscopy. 
We included 16 trials encompassing 2933 colonoscopies in this review. The review showed that completeness of colonoscopy was similar between water infusion and standard air insufflation, and that adenoma detection (participants with at least one adenoma detected) was improved with water colonoscopy (36% versus 31% in the air group).
