What are the most effective interventions during pregnancy for preventing stillbirth?
What is stillbirth? 
A stillbirth is generally defined as the death of a baby before birth, at or after 22 weeks of development. 
Why is this important? 
Stillbirth can be very upsetting for families. It is most common in low‐ and middle‐income countries but also affects people in high‐income countries. Numbers of stillbirths have not fallen much in the last 20 years and, despite the high numbers, it is not widely recognised as a global health problem. It is important to raise awareness of effective methods of preventing stillbirths, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
What did we do? 
Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions aim to answer specific medical questions based on up‐to‐date research studies. We searched for all Cochrane systematic reviews that assessed ways of preventing stillbirth during pregnancy to produce an overview of Cochrane evidence on preventing stillbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 43 Cochrane reviews that assessed 61 different ways of preventing stillbirth during pregnancy, or infant deaths around the time of birth. However, few of these provided any clear evidence of an effect during pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth or infant death. 
We grouped them into four different areas: nutrition, preventing infection, managing mothers' other healthcare problems, and looking after the baby before it is born. 
Nutrition  
‐ Giving mothers balanced energy and protein supplements to increase the growth of the baby, particularly in undernourished pregnant women, probably reduces stillbirth by 40%. 
‐ For Vitamin A alone versus placebo (sham) or no treatment, and multiple micronutrients with iron and folic acid compared with iron with or without folic acid, there was clear evidence of no effect.
