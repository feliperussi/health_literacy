Rapid COJEC versus standard induction therapies for high‐risk neuroblastoma
High‐risk neuroblastoma is a rare malignant disease and mainly affects infants and very young children. The tumors mainly develop in the core part (medulla) of the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland is located on top of the kidneys. A tumor increasing in size would primarily expected to appear in the belly. High‐risk means patients having one or several clinical symptoms or signs, such as metastasis or specific genetic features, which are known to increase the risk for an adverse outcome. The assignment to a high‐risk group is defined by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. In the rapid COJEC induction schedule, higher single doses of selected drugs than standard induction schedules are administered over a substantially shorter treatment period, with shorter intervals between cycles. Shorter intervals and higher doses increase the dose intensity of chemotherapy and might improve survival. 
We identified one randomized controlled trial with 262 patients. We excluded other study designs as they give less reliable results. However, randomized studies are difficult to perform in children with neuroblastoma and other evidence might be available. In the identified randomized study, patients with high‐risk neuroblastoma were randomized to receive either rapid COJEC or standard OPEC/OJEC induction chemotherapy. Complete response, treatment‐related mortality, overall survival, and event‐free survival were not different between the two treatment alternatives. Results of both early and late toxicities were not clear cut, for example, some early toxicities were in favor of the standard arm and some late non‐hematological toxicities were in favor of the rapid COJEC arm. For other toxicities there was no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms. Data on progression‐free survival and health‐related quality of life were not reported. Not all biases could be ruled out in this study. Before definitive conclusions can be made more research is needed.
