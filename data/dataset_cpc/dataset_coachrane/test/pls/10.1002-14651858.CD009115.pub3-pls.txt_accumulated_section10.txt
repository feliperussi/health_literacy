Phonics training for English‐speaking poor readers
Review question 
Does phonics training improve literacy‐related skills in English‐speaking poor readers.
Background 
The reading skills of 16% of children fall below the average range for their age, and 5% of children have significant and severe reading problems. Poor reading is associated with higher risk of school dropout, as well as anxiety, depression, low self‐concept, self‐harm and suicide. Therefore, it is important to provide poor readers with early and effective help. 
'Phonics' training is one of the most common reading treatments used with poor readers, particularly children. Phonics training teaches readers to: identify each letter or letter‐cluster in a new word (e.g. S H I P); transpose each letter or letter‐cluster into its corresponding speech sound ('sh' 'i' 'p'); and blend those speech sounds into a word ('ship'). 
Study characteristics 
The search, updated in May 2018, identified 14 studies that tested phonics training in 923 English‐speaking poor readers. The studies took place in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. Six of the 14 included studies were funded by government agencies and one was funded by a university grant. The rest were funded by charitable foundations or trusts. Each study compared phonics training alone, or with one other reading‐related skill, to either no training (i.e. treatment as usual) or alterative training (e.g. maths). Participants were English‐speaking children or adolescents, of low and middle socioeconomic status, whose reading was one year, one grade, or one standard deviation (distance from the average) below the level expected for their age or grade for no known reason. Phonics training varied between studies in frequency (up to four hours per week), duration (up to seven months), training group size (individual and small groups), and delivery (human and computer). We measured the effect of phonics training on poor readers' ability to read words and novel words (non‐words) accurately and fluently, as well as their comprehension of text, and their knowledge of letter‐sound rules (letter‐sound knowledge) and speech sounds (phonological output). 
Key results 
We found that phonics training in English‐speaking poor readers probably improved irregular word reading accuracy, mixed/regular word reading fluency, and non‐word reading fluency. It may also have improved mixed/regular word reading accuracy, non‐word reading accuracy, reading comprehension, spelling, letter‐sound knowledge, and phonological output.
