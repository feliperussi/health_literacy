Drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer 
What is the aim of this review? To find out whether drugs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors) can improve survival of women diagnosed with locally‐advanced (cancer that has spread beyond the uterus/womb), metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Key messages There is a low certainty of evidence from two clinical trials about the use of drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in women with locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. Based on the small number of completed studies, women who have received prior treatment for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and received an mTOR inhibitor may have a lower risk of their cancer progressing compared to those who received chemotherapy/hormonal therapy alone. However, in women who received mTOR inhibitor‐containing chemotherapy as part of their treatment when first diagnosed with advanced disease, mTOR inhibitor‐containing treatment may result in their disease progressing more quickly and probably with increased complications compared to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy alone. Although mTOR inhibitors may change how long it takes for their cancer to progress, there may be little or no difference in how long women lived after treatment (known as overall survival). We await the publication of at least five studies examining the role of PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
What was studied in the review? Treatment for women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer usually involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or a combination of these to try to shrink or slow the growth of the cancer. The response of the cancer to these treatments is variable, but mostly modest. New treatments are needed to improve outcomes. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway within an endometrial cancer cell is involved in the growth of endometrial cancer, and various drugs have been developed to target this pathway with the aim of reducing the growth of endometrial cancer cells. These are known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors. We found relevant studies looking at mTOR inhibitors. mTOR inhibitors can be given alone or in combination with other cancer treatment drugs. They may be given along with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. mTOR inhibitors act by blocking cancer cells from dividing and reproducing. Their adverse events can include ulcers along the digestive tract (known as mucositis), inflammation of lung tissues (known as pneumonitis) and low red blood cell counts (anaemia). 
We include two studies that randomised 361 women. In one study, women received either an mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus) in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, or the same chemotherapy drugs without the mTOR inhibitor and with a different targeted therapy (bevacizumab). This was given as part of their 'first‐line' treatment after their initial diagnosis of advanced endometrial cancer. In the second study, women with recurrent disease or who had been treated with chemotherapy at least once before received an mTOR inhibitor (ridaforolimus) on its own, compared with a chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and no mTOR inhibitor.
