Benefits and harms of celecoxib to treat people with osteoarthritis
Review question 
We evaluated benefits and harms of celecoxib, a drug used to treat people with osteoarthritis, to improve pain, movement, quality of life and drug safety. 
Background 
Osteoarthritis is a joint disease (mostly knees and hips) caused when cartilage wears away leading to pain, joint stiffness and inflammation, which can cause limited mobility and reduces quality of life. Celecoxib is marketed as being as effective as traditional anti‐inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs such as naproxen and diclofenac) but with fewer gut and other problems. 
Study characteristics 
We searched up to April 2017 and included 36 trials that involved 17,206 adults who received 200 mg celecoxib daily (9402 participants), or either another drug (naproxen ‐ 6 trials, or diclofenac ‐ 3 trials, total of 1869 participants) or a fake treatment (placebo ‐ 32 trials, 5935 participants). 
On average, participants were aged 62 years and had osteoarthritis for 7.9 years. Participants had knee, hip, or both, osteoarthritis; most were women and white. 
Study funding sources 
Most studies (34/36) were funded by the studied drugs manufacturers, and (34/36) included authors who worked for drug companies. 
Key results 
Celecoxib, compared with placebo, slightly reduced pain, improved physical function, and probably did not increase numbers of people who withdrew from trials because of problems with the treatment. However, these results were unlikely to be clinically significant. Very low quality evidence meant that we are uncertain if celecoxib caused harms, such as gut or heart problems when compared with placebo. However, drug regulatory agencies have warned of increased risk of heart problems with celecoxib. 
Celecoxib and tNSAIDs reduced pain by the same amount; celecoxib slightly improved physical function compared with tNSAIDs. Evidence comparing celecoxib and tNSAIDs was low to very low quality, so it is uncertain if harms (such as heart or gut problems) occurred from taking these drugs. 
None of the high‐quality studies assessed quality of life.
Quality of evidence 
Evidence quality was poor and results should be interpreted cautiously. Because it is known that sponsorship by the manufacturing drug company may lead to more favorable results and conclusions than sponsorship from other sources, we are highly reserved about results due to significant drug industry involvement and few data. 
We were unable to obtain data from three trials which included 15,539 participants (awaiting assessment); Pfizer declined to provide data for two reports that involved 14,042 participants.
