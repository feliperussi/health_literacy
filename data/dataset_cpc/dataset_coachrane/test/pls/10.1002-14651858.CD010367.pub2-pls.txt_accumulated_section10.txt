Dressings and securement for central venous catheters (CVCs)
Background 
A central venous catheter (CVC) is a tube that is inserted into a blood vessel to enable the delivery of liquid nutrition, blood, medicine or fluids (or a combination of these) to a person who is ill. If a CVC is in place the patient does not need to suffer repeated needle insertions when treatments are due, as tubes can be attached to the CVC, the required fluid pumped in, and then the tubes detached when appropriate. 
CVCs need to be secured adequately, usually with a dressing of some kind, in order to prevent them from becoming dislodged and to avoid infection (for example, catheter‐related bloodstream infections (BSI)), and need to be comfortable for the patient. Many different types of products are available to secure CVCs, but it is not known which works best. 
Review question 
The objective of this research was to compare the available dressings and securement devices for CVCs to identify which works best. 
What we found 
The researchers searched medical databases up to September 2014, and identified 22 studies with a total of 7436 participants that were relevant to the research question. The studies investigated the following comparisons: 
‐ nine studies compared sterile gauze with standard polyurethane dressings; ‐ six studies compared standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate‐impregnated dressings (chlorhexidine gluconate is an antibacterial disinfectant); ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with silver‐impregnated dressings (silver compounds may have antibacterial properties); ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with hydrocolloid dressings; ‐ one study compared 'modern' gas permeable standard polyurethane dressings with 'old' (original) standard polyurethane dressings; ‐ one study compared highly adhesive transparent standard polyurethane dressings with chlorhexidine gluconate dressings; ‐ one study compared standard polyurethane dressings with sutureless (stitchless) securement devices; ‐ one study compared sterile gauze with no dressing; and ‐ one study compared chlorhexidine gluconate dressings with no dressings. 
The included studies sometimes did not clearly report the methods they had used to minimise accidental or statistical error, but overall the methods were adequate.
