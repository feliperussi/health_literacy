Sunlight for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns
Review question 
How safe and effective is sunlight for treating or preventing jaundice (yellowing of the skin, called hyperbilirubinemia) in newborns? 
Background 
Babies with jaundice are often treated with phototherapy lamps, which emit blue‐green light that alters the bilirubin (yellow substance found naturally in the baby's blood) so that it can be more easily excreted. 
Sunlight emits light in a similar spectrum. However, sunlight also emits harmful ultraviolet rays and infrared radiation, which can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Further, exposing babies to sunlight might mean they could get too warm or too cold, depending on the climate. 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC) phototherapy is not always available for babies who need it. Further, babies in these countries can be at increased risk for dangerous jaundice, where the bilirubin in their blood reaches levels that allow it to cross the blood‐brain barrier and cause damage to the brain. Babies in LMIC are at increased risk for jaundice for a number of reasons, including poor access to maternal care during pregnancy, increased numbers of blood disorders causing jaundice, and increased risk of infection or birth trauma. 
Given that sunlight is readily available, there is an urgent need to determine if sunlight is safe and effective at treating jaundice in babies in LMIC. 
Study characteristics 
We included three clinical trials containing 1103 infants from two countries. The trials included infants born at or near their due date (35 weeks of gestation or later) who were less than two weeks old. One study evaluated healthy babies, and the other two evaluated babies with jaundice. In one study, the babies received either sunlight therapy or no treatment to assess sunlight for the prevention or reduction of jaundice. In the other two studies, infants with jaundice were randomly assigned to receive treatment with phototherapy machines or to receive sunlight through a light‐filtering tent that blocked ultraviolet light and infrared radiation, and these groups were compared for improvement in their jaundice. One study did not comment on funding. The other two studies were funded by the Thrasher Research Fund. Evidence is current to June 2020.
