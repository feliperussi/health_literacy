Induction of labour in women with normal pregnancies at or beyond 37 weeks
Does a policy of inducing labour at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation reduce risks for babies and their mothers when compared with a policy of waiting until a later gestational age, or until there is an indication for induction of labour? 
This review was originally published in 2006 and subsequently updated in 2012 and 2018. 
What is the issue? 
The average pregnancy lasts 40 weeks from the start of the woman's last menstrual period. Pregnancies continuing beyond 42 weeks are described as 'post‐term' or 'postdate' and a woman and her clinician may decide to bring the birth on by induction. Factors associated with post‐term birth include obesity, first baby and the mother being more than 30 years old. 
Why is this important? 
Prolonged gestation may increase risks for babies, including a greater risk of death (before or shortly after birth). However, inducing labour may also have risks for mothers and their babies, especially if the women’s cervix is not ready to go into labour. Current tests cannot predict the risks for babies or their mother, as such, and many hospitals have policies for how long pregnancies should be allowed to continue. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (17 July 2019) and identified 34 randomised controlled trials based in 16 different countries and involving > 21,500 women (mostly with low risk of complications). The trials compared a policy of inducing labour usually after 41 completed weeks of gestation (> 287 days) with a policy of waiting (expectant management). 
A policy of labour induction was associated with fewer perinatal deaths (22 trials, 18,795 infants). Four perinatal deaths occurred in the labour induction policy group compared with 25 perinatal deaths in the expectant management group. Fewer stillbirths occurred in the induction group (22 trials, 18,795 infants), with two in the induction policy group and 16 in the expectant management group. 
Women in the induction arms of the trials were probably less likely to have a caesarean section compared with expectant management (31 trials, 21,030 women) and there was probably little or no difference in assisted vaginal births (22 trials, 18,584 women). 
Fewer babies went into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the policy of labour induction group (17 trials, 17,826 infants; high‐certainty evidence). A simple test of the baby’s health (Apgar score) at five minutes was probably more favourable in the induction groups compared with expectant management (20 trials, 18,345 infants). 
A policy of induction may make little or no difference to the women experiencing perineal trauma and probably makes little or no difference to the number of women having a postpartum haemorrhage, or breastfeeding at discharge. We are uncertain about the effect of induction or expectant management on the length of maternal hospital stay due to very low‐certainty evidence.
