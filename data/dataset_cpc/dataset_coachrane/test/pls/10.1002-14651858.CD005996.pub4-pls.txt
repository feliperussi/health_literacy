Peri‐implantation glucocorticoid administration for assisted reproductive technology cycles 
Review question 
This review investigated whether the administration of glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation improved the chance of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) when compared to no glucocorticoid administration. IVF and ICSI are both treatments to help achieve pregnancy. 
Background 
Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that are similar to the steroid hormones that are naturally made in the body. These medicines reduce inflammation and suppress the body's immune system. Glucocorticoids suppress the inflammation of the endometrium (the tissue in the womb where the embryo implants). Therefore, glucocorticoids have been suggested to improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised controlled trials (studies where treatments are decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects) comparing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation versus no glucocorticoids or placebo (dummy treatment), in 2232 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to 20 December 2021. 
Key results 
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference in live birth rates after glucocorticoids. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in multiple pregnancy rates (more than one embryo per pregnancy). With regard to ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo. The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in adverse events such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (pain and swelling of the ovaries and tummy), but these were poorly and inconsistently reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was very low to low quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the small size of included studies. More research is needed to work out the possible role of this therapy in well‐defined patient groups.
