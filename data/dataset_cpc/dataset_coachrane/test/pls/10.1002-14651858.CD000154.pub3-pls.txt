Combined hormonal contraceptives for heavy menstrual bleeding
Review question 
Researchers in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group reviewed the evidence about the effects of combined hormonal contraceptives versus no treatment, placebo (sham treatment), or other medical treatments for women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). 
Background 
HMB can cause anaemia (too few red blood cells) and interfere with a woman's quality of life and well‐being. This means that premenopausal women may often consult with their own doctor or seek referral to gynaecology specialists to treat their menstrual bleeding. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) can provide control of the menstrual cycle by thinning the endometrium (the lining of the womb that is shed during menstruation). It is possible that contraceptives delivered in other ways (via a vaginal ring or patch on the skin) may also act in a similar way and reduce menstrual blood loss. 
Study characteristics 
Eight studies, which included 805 women, were identified that compared combined hormonal contraceptives (mostly, the combined contraceptive pill) with either no treatment, placebo or other medical treatments. The studies assessed the effects of interventions on menstrual bleeding, satisfaction, quality of life, adverse events, and haemoglobin levels (protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body). The evidence is current to September 2018. 
Key results 
Two studies found that a type of COCP, containing estradiol valerate and dienogest, reduced HMB and improved quality of life and haemoglobin levels when compared with placebo, but at the expense of some minor side effects. There was insufficient evidence to compare contraceptives with other treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatories or progestogens. Two studies found that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) was more effective than the COCP at reducing menstrual blood loss. Two trials found no evidence of different effects between the oral contraceptive pill or the hormonal vaginal ring. We found no studies that assessed the effects of the combined hormonal patch (transdermal patch). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence that compared the oral contraceptive pill with placebo was moderate, but the evidence for the other comparisons was either low or very low in quality. The LNG IUS is more effective than the COCP at reducing menstrual bleeding but evidence was insufficient for the other treatment comparisons. This means that, although it is likely that combined hormonal contraceptives can reduce HMB, we cannot be absolutely certain how they compare with other medical treatments for reducing HMB (although LNG IUS appears to be more effective).
