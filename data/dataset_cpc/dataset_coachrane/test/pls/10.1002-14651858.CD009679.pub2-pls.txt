Surgical fixation methods for treating tibial plateau fractures (breaks in the top end of the shin bone) in adults 
What is the medical problem?  Fractures of the tibial plateau are injuries affecting the top end of the tibia (shin bone), which forms the lower bone surface in the knee joint. These fractures are often associated with a large amount of damage to the skin and muscle and may cause voids or defects in the bone. 
What treatments are available?  Often, complex fractures are set surgically through open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), which entails exposing the fracture to direct view and then fastening the bone fragments into place with metal plates and screws. Another method is external fixation, where wires and pins are placed into the bone around the fracture site to secure the fragments in place until they heal. External fixation can be coupled with the use of small plates or screws to hold some of the fracture fragments in position; this is called hybrid fixation. 
To correct possible bone defects, bone void fillers, either bone grafts taken from the patients themselves or bone substitutes, may be used. 
What evidence is available?  We found six small studies (involving 429 adults) of different fixation methods and bone fillers in September 2014. All six trials were small and at substantial risk of bias. We judged the quality of most of the available evidence to be very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about these results 
Three studies evaluated different methods of fixation. One study found that hybrid fixation is more likely to result in better quality of life and lower‐limb function, fewer complications requiring repeat surgery, and more people returning to pre‐injury activity levels than standard ORIF. However, the possibility of a better result from ORIF could not be ruled out. Another study compared a minimally invasive, single‐plate technique with a traditional open technique using two plates. This study found very little difference between the two groups in knee function, complications or reoperations. The third study compared arthroscopic surgery (which uses a tiny camera to visualise the joint) and internal fixation versus ORIF. It reported better functional outcome and knee mobility in the arthroscopy group. There were no reoperations. 
Three studies compared different bone substitutes versus bone grafts for managing bone defects, but reported on only a few outcomes. One study found similar results in the two groups in the numbers of participants with good walking, stair climbing, squatting and jumping ability at one year. All three studies found similar numbers of specific complications in the two groups. One study found that all participants in the bone graft group had prolonged pain from the harvest site of the bone graft. Two studies reported similar range of motion results in the two groups, whereas the third study found better results in the bone substitute group at one year. 
Conclusions  Currently, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain the best surgical methods of fixation and bone defect treatment for tibial plateau fractures in adults. Well‐conducted trials are still needed to inform clinical decision‐making.
