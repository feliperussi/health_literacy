A coated, longer‐lasting form of doxorubicin hydrochloride for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer 
Background 
The choice of chemotherapy in women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is influenced by the duration of the platinum‐free interval, the length of time from the last platinum‐based cycle to the time of disease progression. Women who relapse within one month of receiving platinum therapy or who progress on therapy are considered to be platinum‐refractory; women who relapse between one and six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum‐resistant; and women who relapse more than six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum‐sensitive. The latter group is further subgrouped by women who relapse between six and 12 months after platinum therapy (partially platinum‐sensitive) and those who relapse after 12 months. 
Doxirubicin hydrochloride is an anti‐cancer drug that works by interfering with cancer cell DNA. A newer form of doxorubicin called pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been developed with a coating that allows it to reach higher concentrations in cancer cells and with less adverse effects on the heart. 
Review question 
We conducted this review to determine whether PLD was effective and safe compared with other drugs used for relapsed EOC. 
Main findings 
We searched electronic databases and other resources for studies of PLD for relapsed ovarian cancerEOC, and included 14 studies up to October 2012. Most of these studies (12/14) were funded by drug manufacturers with a commercial interest in PLD (two studies) or the comparator drugs (10 studies). For women with platinum‐sensitive relapsed EOC, we pooled data from two studies (1164 participants) that compared carboplatin plus PLD (PLD/carbo) with standard treatment (paclitaxel plus carbo (PAC/carbo)). Women survived for a similar length of time overall on these two treatments but the cancer took longer to progress in those receiving PLD/carbo. Women who received PLD experienced more severe low blood cell counts than the standard treatment. By comparison, women in the standard treatment group experienced more severe hair loss, nerve damage, allergic reactions, and joint and muscle pain. More women in the standard treatment group stopped treatment early suggesting that PLD/carbo was better tolerated than standard treatment. We concluded that PLD/carbo was a better treatment option than PAC/carbo for platinum‐sensitive relapsed EOC.
