Does a tax on the fat content of foods reduce obesity and help people to eat less fat and less saturated fat? 
What is obesity? 
Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. 
Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. 
Obesity can lead to serious and life‐threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well‐being). 
What are fats? 
Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: 
‐ saturated (mostly from animal products, such as meat, cow's milk, cheese, cream, and butter); and 
‐ unsaturated (mostly found in oils from plants and fish).
Health guidelines usually recommend that people should:
‐ reduce the overall amount of fat they eat;
‐ limit the amount of saturated fats they eat; and
‐ eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the:
