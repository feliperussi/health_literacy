Nutritional support for adults with swallowing difficulties
Background 
A number of conditions compromise the transport of food along the digestive tract. Patients with swallowing disturbances can develop low nutritional status, which affects their recovery from illness, surgery, and injury. Conditions associated with swallowing disorders include stroke, neurological diseases, dementia, cancers of the head and neck, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, physical obstruction, and dysphagia from stroke. Nasogastric tube feeding is a time proven technique to provide nutritional support; the tube can be inserted by a nurse. Percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG) involves a feeding tube inserted directly into the stomach through the abdomen and is particularly useful when enteral nutrition is needed for a length of time. 
Review question 
Prolonged use of a nasal tube can lead to adverse events such as damage to the nose and larynx, chronic sinusitis, gastro‚Äêoesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia (which can result from inhalation of stomach contents leading to lower respiratory tract infection and pneumonia). 
Study characteristics 
We obtained updated evidence for this review from 11 randomised controlled studies comparing a nasogastric tube with PEG in a total of 735 patients. Seven studies measured treatment failure i.e. feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the feeding tube in 408 patients randomised to either a nasal gastric tube or PEG. 
Key results 
The studies showed a higher probability of treatment failure with a nasal gastric tube. The number of deaths was no different with the two methods; nor was the overall occurrence of adverse events. Participants with PEGs may have a better quality of life.
