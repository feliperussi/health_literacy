Transvaginal mesh or grafts compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse
Review question 
Should transvaginal mesh or biological grafts or native tissue be utilised to repair vaginal prolapse? 
Background 
Pelvic organ prolapse is common, affecting as many as 50% of women who have had children. The traditional method of repairing vaginal prolapse using native tissue is associated with high rates of recurrence. It is thought that transvaginal grafts made of absorbable or permanent mesh or biological material may improve the outcomes of prolapse surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We evaluated 37 randomised controlled trials (4023 women) comparing transvaginal grafts versus traditional native tissue repair for repairing vaginal prolapse. The evidence is current to July 2015. 
Key results 
Low to moderate quality evidence suggests that there are advantages to using transvaginal permanent mesh compared to native tissue repair, including lower rates of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery for prolapse, and recurrent prolapse on examination. The evidence suggests that if 19% of women are aware of prolapse after native tissue repair, between 10% and 15% will be aware of prolapse after permanent mesh repair. If the rate of recurrent prolapse on examination after a native tissue repair is assumed to be 38%, the risk would be between 11% and 20% after a repair with transvaginal permanent mesh. However, there are also problems associated with permanent transvaginal mesh. If we assume that 5% of women require repeat surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence or mesh exposure (any of the three) after native tissue repair, the risk would be between 7% and 18% after permanent mesh repair. Eight per cent of women in the mesh groups required repeat surgery for mesh exposure.
