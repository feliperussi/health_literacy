Does the use of antimicrobial mouthwash or nasal spray by people who are not actively suspected of having COVID‐19 ‐ or by their healthcare workers ‐ protect their healthcare workers when they undertake 'aerosol‐generating procedures' on them? 
Why is this question important? 
COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Most people infected with COVID‐19 develop a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection). Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care. 
COVID‐19 spreads from person to person primarily through droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. A person can also become infected by touching a surface or object that has viral droplets on it, and then touching their own mouth or nose. 
Some people with COVID‐19 do not have any symptoms, therefore they might not be known to be or suspected of being infected. However, they might still be able to pass the infection on to others. This means that healthcare workers who are treating them may be at risk of catching the infection. Risk of infection may be particularly high when healthcare workers undertake 'aerosol‐generating procedures', which are medical procedures that cause the patient to produce many small droplets. For example, people who have surgery under general anaesthesia, or people with a lung disease that makes breathing difficult (such as pneumonia), may need to be placed on a ventilator (artificial breathing machine) to help them breathe. This requires a healthcare worker to insert a tube through the patient's mouth, into their airway – a procedure during which many small droplets are likely to be produced by the patient. Similar droplets can be produced during routine dental procedures, such as drilling or scaling of teeth.
