Aspirin and similar drugs for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Key messages 
‐ When used after standard initial treatment with anticoagulants, aspirin and similar drugs (antiplatelet agents) in addition to best medical practice (BMP), may reduce recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), i.e. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), when compared to BMP plus placebo in a chronic DVT setting. There is no clear difference in side effects, major bleeding or PE with the use of antiplatelet agents. 
‐ Studies of high methodological quality that are large and long enough to detect significant clinical outcomes are needed to assess the long‐term effect of antiplatelet agents. Studies should include people with acute and chronic DVT and include information about important outcomes such as DVT, PE and major bleeding, the use of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and the age of the participants. 
What is DVT? 
DVT is a blood clot formed inside the venous system of the body, blocking the flow of blood. 
How is DVT treated? 
After initial treatment with anticoagulants, people receive follow‐up treatment (known as BMP) which include drugs for preventing new clots, compression stockings and clinical care (such as physical exercise and skin hydration). Antiplatelets such as aspirin, are medicines that stop cells in the blood (platelets) from sticking together and forming a clot. They could therefore be seen as a potential additional intervention to the current BMP for treating DVT. Antiplatelets could be used to minimise complications such as post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS, a situation in which a blood clot in the vein causes impaired function in the affected vessels), and PE (when the blood clot travels through the bloodstream to the lung and blocks its flow). Antiplatelets may also reduce the recurrence of DVT or PE. One drawback of the use of antiplatelets is the potential for an increase in bleeding.
