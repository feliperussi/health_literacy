CFTR correctors, a therapy for cystic fibrosis targeted at specific variants (most commonly F508del) 
Review question 
We looked at drugs (or drug combinations) for correcting the basic defect in the most common cystic fibrosis (CF)‐causing gene variant (F508del) and assessed their impact on outcomes important to people with CF (pwCF), e.g. survival, quality of life (QoL), lung function and safety. 
Background 
The CF gene makes a protein that helps salts move across cells in many parts of the body; over 80% of pwCF have at least one copy of F508del, meaning they make a full length of this protein, but it can not move through the cell correctly. Laboratory experiments suggest that if this protein reaches the cell wall, it may be able to function, restore salt movement and correct the chronic problems that pwCF experience. We examined several agents for correcting F508del. Our original review showed that while single drugs alone were not effective, they were when combined with other drugs. This updated review includes single, dual (corrector plus potentiator) and triple therapies (two different correctors plus one potentiator).

Study characteristics 
We included 19 studies (2959 pwCF (children and adults)) lasting between 1 day and 24 weeks (with an extension of two studies up to 96 weeks). Eight studies (344 participants) compared monotherapy: 4PBA, CPX, lumacaftor, cavosonstat and FDL169) to placebo (dummy treatment containing no active medicine), six studies (1840 participants) compared dual therapy (lumacaftor‐ivacaftor or tezacaftor‐ivacaftor) to placebo. Five studies (775 participants) assessed triple therapy (elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor or VX‐659‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor); only the combination with elexacaftor progressed beyond early studies. In 14 studies participants had two copies of F508del, in two studies participants had one F508del variant and one different variant, while in three studies participants had either two copies of F508del or one copy of F508del and one different variant.
