Effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (with or without valve surgery) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC, the temporary blockage of arterial blood flow to one arm or one leg before surgery after induction of anaesthesia) in people undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without additional valve surgery. 
Background 
Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from progressive blockage of the coronary arteries. If coronary arteries are partly or fully blocked, they cannot supply the heart with enough oxygen. Symptoms of CAD include shortness of breath, pain in the upper body (e.g. arms, left shoulder, back, etc). CAD can be treated with medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Despite substantial improvements in surgical strategies, cardiac surgery is associated with severe complications. Several approaches have been implemented to reduce the risk during surgery (hypothermia, cardioplegic solutions, and the limitation of procedure times). These strategies have led to a pronounced reduction in mortality and morbidity, however, biomarkers of ischaemia indicate persisting postoperative myocardial damage. RIPC has been reported to reduce these biomarkers of ischaemia in people who undergo cardiac surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to assess whether this practice improves clinical outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomised trials in which people scheduled for CABG (with or without valve surgery) were randomly assigned to receive RIPC or sham intervention before surgery. The evidence is current to May 2016. We did not identify any source of bias related to the funding of included studies. 
Key results 
We identified 29 studies involving 5392 participants (mean age = 64 years, age range 23 to 86 years, 82% male). RIPC does not improve clinical outcome in people undergoing CABG with or without valve surgery (measured as a composite endpoint including all‐cause mortality, non‐fatal myocardial infarction or any new stroke, or both, assessed at 30 days after surgery, moderate‐quality evidence). There is moderate‐quality evidence that RIPC reduces the amount of cardiac troponin T release measured at 72 hours and measured as AUC (72 hours). There is moderate‐quality evidence that cardiac troponin I release measured at 48 hours and 72 hours after surgery is lower in the RIPC group than in the control group. Regarding troponin T measured at 48 hours and troponin I measured as AUC 72 hours after surgery there was no difference between groups (low‐ and moderate‐quality evidence). However, this effect on biomarkers does not result in improved clinical outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
We used reliable methods to assess the quality of the trial evidence. The quality of the evidence of key outcomes ranged from moderate to low quality due to the presence of moderate or high statistical heterogeneity, imprecision of results or due to limitations in the design of individual studies.
