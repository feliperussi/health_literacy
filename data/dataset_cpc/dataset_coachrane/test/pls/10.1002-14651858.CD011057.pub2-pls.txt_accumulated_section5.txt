Risperidone versus other antipsychotics for people with dual diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder 
What is dual diagnosis? 
Dual diagnosis is a term used to describe people who have both a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder. Up to 75% of people with a serious mental illness (SMI) are dual diagnosis. It has been suggested that one of the reasons behind the high levels of substance use in people with SMI is due to 'self‐medication', with patients taking additional drugs in order to counter their distressing symptoms. People with a dual diagnosis have been shown to have more complications in their treatment, including higher rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation, more contact with legal and forensic services, higher levels of psychotic symptoms, more risk‐taking behaviour, greater levels of side‐effects to antipsychotics and lower medication adherence. Antipsychotics are the main treatment for SMI. It has been suggested that second‐generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as risperidone may be superior to older, first‐generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in improving negative affective states, reducing drug craving, improving subjective well‐being, and may lead to fewer side‐effects and hence greater medication adherence. Such improvements in symptoms may lead to less self‐medication with alcohol and drugs, and improved overall mental states. However it remains unclear to what extent risperidone, one of the first atypical antipsychotics to be manufactured, is superior to other antipsychotics for dual diagnosis.
