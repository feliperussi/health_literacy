Stent placement versus surgery to control symptoms of a blocked stomach outlet caused by inoperable cancer 
Review question 
Is surgery or an endoscopic stent better for the treatment of blockage of the stomach (gastric) outlet that is caused by cancer? 
Background 
Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small bowel, pancreas) can block the outlet of the stomach leading to vomiting, abdominal pain and the inability to eat or drink. For people whose survival is already limited by their cancer, these symptoms are distressing and will ultimately shorten their life expectancy. Restoring the ability to eat and drink is of supreme importance to improve their quality of life. 
Two interventions are available to overcome this blockage. A surgical procedure to join the stomach to the upper small bowel (gastrojejunostomy), thereby, diverting food around the blockage can be performed. This can be done via an incision in the abdomen (open) or via small keyhole incisions (laparoscopic). The alternative is the placement of a plastic or metal tube (stent) across the narrowed or blocked area which is placed through the mouth and oesophagus (food pipe) (endoscopic). 
Study characteristics 
Three studies with 84 participants compared a surgical operation to bypass the blockage with the placement of a duodenal stent to bridge the blockage. The evidence is current to May 2018. 
Key results 
All studies found that people were able to eat and drink sooner following the placement of a duodenal stent and were subsequently discharged from hospital quicker. The return of symptoms was more likely after a stent and people required further treatment to again restore the ability to eat and drink. 
There was a higher number of immediate problems in the participants undergoing gastrojejunostomy, including wound and chest infections. In some of the participants who had a stent, subsequent blockage of the stent occurred that required a repeat procedure.
