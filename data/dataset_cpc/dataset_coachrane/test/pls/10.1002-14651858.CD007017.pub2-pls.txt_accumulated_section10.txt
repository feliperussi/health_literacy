The effect of direct payment policies on people’s use of medicines 
Researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration conducted the first update of the original review of the effects of different policies determining how much people should pay for their medicines. Between 2011 and 2013, they searched for all relevant studies and found 32 studies. Their findings are summarised below. 
What are pharmaceutical payment policies? 
Large quantities of healthcare funds are spent on medicines, and these amounts are increasing. Spending more on medicines could mean having less money for other healthcare or non‐healthcare services. Also, misuse, overuse and underuse of appropriate medicines can lead to wasted resources and health hazards. Health insurers therefore are looking for ways of ensuring better use of medicines and controlling the costs of medicines, while still ensuring that patients get the medicines they need. 
Patient payment policies vary with respect to the medicines included, the patient groups targeted, the amount of money patients are expected to pay and the ways in which they are expected to pay. Different policies may be used alone or together and include the following. 
1. With a cap policy, patients are reimbursed for their prescription medicines up to a maximum amount, then are expected to pay costs higher than this amount. 
2. With a fixed co‐payment policy, patients pay a fixed amount per medicine or prescription.
3. With a co‐insurance policy, patients pay a set percentage of the price of the prescription or medicine, rather than a fixed fee. 
4. With a ceiling policy, patients pay full cost or part of the cost up to a certain amount, then are given medicines for free or at reduced cost. 
These policies may lead people to use fewer medicines or to choose cheaper medicines. Although they may deter people from using unnecessary medicines, these policies may cause harm.
