Vitamin C for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy)
Review question 
What are the benefits or harms of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the treatment of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease? 
Background 
CMT disease represents a broad spectrum of inherited peripheral neuropathies (conditions in which the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord are damaged), which in general progress slowly, and cause muscle wasting and loss of sensation. Muscle wasting and loss of sensation are caused by destruction of nerve fibres that go to the muscles or skin. Vitamin C has been proposed as a treatment for CMT, because vitamin C is necessary for myelination (development of the myelin, or insulation around the nerve fibres) in laboratory cultures of nerve cells and the peripheral nerves of mice. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for trials of vitamin C in CMT disease and found six trials ‐ five in adults and one in children ‐ on the treatment of CMT type 1A (CMT1A) with vitamin C. All compared vitamin C doses of 1 to 4 grams per day with a placebo (a dummy or sugar pill disguised as vitamin C), and lasted for 12 or 24 months. The trials in adults included a total of 622 people. The other trial included 80 children. The main measure of the effects of vitamin C in this review was change in impairment. We also collected information on disability, nerve conduction studies, sensation, muscle strength, quality of life and harmful effects of vitamin C. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
We found that ascorbic acid treatment did not improve impairment from CMT1A in adults as measured by the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). In children, the CMTNS was not reported, as it is a measure developed for adults with CMT. The measures used for children in this study did not show benefit from vitamin C. The studies were largely at low risk of bias, meaning they were well designed and the results were not easily influenced by chance. Adverse events were similar in nature and number in vitamin C and placebo groups.
