Aromatase inhibitors for treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women
Advanced (or metastatic) breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph node areas. Breast cancer can progress to metastatic disease despite the person undergoing a range of therapies given after initial treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Metastatic breast cancer is treatable but it is not curable. Most breast cancer is sensitive to the female hormone oestrogen. Sensitive cancer cells need oestrogen to stay alive and removal of oestrogen from the body, or stopping any circulating oestrogen getting to the cancer cells, is very effective treatment for hormone‐sensitive breast cancers. Endocrine (hormonal) therapy removes the influence of oestrogen on breast cancer cells. Hormonal treatments for advanced breast cancer include tamoxifen, the progestins megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs reduce the body's ability to make (synthesise) oestrogen and have tumour‐regressing effects. The AIs in current clinical use include anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. 
The aim of this systematic review was to compare AIs to other endocrine therapy in the treatment of advanced (metastatic) breast cancer. A systematic search was conducted which identified 37 controlled trials in which over 14,000 women were randomised to treatment groups. Treatment with an AI improved survival for women with metastatic disease by 10%. The overall benefits on disease‐free survival and response of the tumour were however unclear based on the studies included in this review. Trials using AIs as first‐line and second‐line therapy reported benefits of therapy that varied with the different AIs and measures of effectiveness. We were unable to identify specific subgroups of women who may benefit from AI use.
