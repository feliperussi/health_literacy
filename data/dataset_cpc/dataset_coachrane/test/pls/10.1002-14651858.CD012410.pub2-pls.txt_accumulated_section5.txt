L‐ornithine L‐aspartate for people with chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy (poor brain functioning) 
Background 
Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with this condition commonly develop hepatic encephalopathy, a complication that results in poor brain functioning. Some people with cirrhosis develop obvious clinical features of disturbed brain functioning, such as difficulties with speech, balance and daily functioning; they are said to have overt hepatic encephalopathy; the changes may be short‐lived, may recur, or may persist for long periods. Other people with cirrhosis may show no obvious clinical changes but some aspects of their brain function, such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are found to be impaired when tested; they are said to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy. The reason why people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex, but the accumulation in the blood of toxins from the gut, particularly of a compound called ammonia, plays a key role. L‐ornithine L‐aspartate lowers blood ammonia levels and so may have beneficial effects in people with hepatic encephalopathy or help stop them developing it. 
Review question 
We investigated the use of L‐ornithine L‐aspartate given either by mouth (oral) or into a vein in an fluid drip (intravenous) for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by reviewing clinical trials in which people with cirrhosis were randomly allocated to treatment with L‐ornithine L‐aspartate, to an inactive dummy (called placebo), to no treatment, or to another medicine for this condition such as lactulose, probiotics and rifaximin. We included participants with cirrhosis who had overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy or who were at risk for developing this complication.
