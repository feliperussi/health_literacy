Screening hysteroscopy in subfertile women trying to conceive spontaneously, and before in vitro fertilisation 
Review question 
To assess the safety and usefulness of performing a screening hysteroscopy on reproductive outcomes in women trying to conceive spontaneously, and those undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). 
Background 
In women with an unexplained problem in becoming pregnant, or those seeking advanced fertility treatment, such as intrauterine insemination or IVF, it has been suggested that performing a hysteroscopy (visualisation of the inside of the womb, using a telescope) may help improve success. The routine ultrasound done during the work‐up may miss smaller abnormalities inside the womb, which may be detected and treated simultaneously by performing a hysteroscopy. It may also increase success by facilitating the subsequent insemination or embryo transfer, by widening the passage to the womb (cervical dilatation), or because of a scratching effect on the endometrium (lining of the womb), which may help to improve embryo implantation (adherence to lining of womb). 
Study characteristics 
For women wishing to become pregnant spontaneously, we found one trial (200 women). For women undergoing IVF, we included ten trials (3750 women). All trials evaluated the effects of screening hysteroscopy compared to no hysteroscopy. The evidence is current to September 2018. 
Key results 
In women wishing to become pregnant spontaneously, hysteroscopy was associated with a higher chance for an ongoing and clinical pregnancy in one study at high risk of bias. The trial reported no adverse events following hysteroscopy. The miscarriage rate was higher following hysteroscopy. 
In women undergoing IVF, the included studies suggested that performing a screening hysteroscopy first, improved the chances of live birth or clinical pregnancy. However, adverse events following hysteroscopy were poorly reported, and therefore, we were unable to assess the safety of this intervention. For women at a typical clinic with a 22% live birth rate, performing a screening hysteroscopy would be expected to result in live birth rates between 25% and 32%. There was no increased risk of miscarriage following hysteroscopy. 
We found no trials with women who were seeking intrauterine insemination.
Quality of the evidence 
There was very low‐quality evidence from one study in women who were trying to become pregnant spontaneously. 
There was low‐quality evidence that a screening hysteroscopy, performed prior to IVF, may increase the chance of live birth or clinical pregnancy, and very low‐quality evidence about adverse events following hysteroscopy. The quality of the evidence was reduced because of risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity.
