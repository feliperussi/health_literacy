Are inhaled anticholinergics added to β2‐agonists beneficial in children hospitalised with acute asthma? 
Background: Anticholinergics (e.g. ipratropium bromide, atropine sulfate) are inhaled drugs. They relax the airway muscles and decrease secretions. Anticholinergics are sometimes used in addition to beta2‐agonists (such as salbutamol and terbutaline), which are potent drugs given to relax smooth muscles in the airways in children with acute asthma. We do not know whether the addition of inhaled anticholinergics to beta2‐agonists is beneficial for children hospitalised with acute asthma. 
Review question: We wished to examine the efficacy and safety of inhaled or nebulised (mist inhaled into the lungs) anticholinergics added to beta2‐agonists compared with beta2‐agonists alone in children one to 18 years of age hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. 
Study characteristics: In reviewing evidence available until November 2013, we found seven eligible studies of children hospitalised with acute asthma; four of these studies (472 children one to 18 years of age) contributed data to the review. Four studies compared the combination of anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide) and beta2‐agonists versus the same dose of beta2‐agonists alone. Included studies enrolled both girls and boys, with a gender ratio ranging from 59% to 73% males. 
Results: No additional benefit was noted by adding anticholinergics to β2‐agonists in terms of duration of hospital stay in patients compared to those who received beta2‐agonists alone. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. No trial reported information on serious adverse events. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other markers of response to therapy, that is, the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short‐acting beta2‐agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. 
Conclusion: No apparent benefit is derived from adding anticholinergics to beta2‐agonists in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, that is, beyond initial treatment in the emergency department. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevents firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with very severe exacerbations who are admitted to the ICU. Our findings support the ongoing recommendations provided by national and international guidelines.
