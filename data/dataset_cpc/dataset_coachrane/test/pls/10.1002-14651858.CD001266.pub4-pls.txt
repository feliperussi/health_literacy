Bronchodilators for bronchiolitis for infants with first‚Äêtime wheezing
What is bronchiolitis? 
Bronchiolitis is an acute, highly contagious, viral infection of the lungs that is common in infants 0 to 12 months of age. It occurs every year in the winter months. It causes the small airways in the lungs to become inflamed and fill with debris. The airways are narrowed and this leads to blocking of the free passage of air. The infant has a harsh cough, runny nose and usually a fever. S/he can become breathless, wheezy and short of oxygen. 
Why review bronchodilators? 
Bronchodilators are drugs often used as aerosols to widen the air passages by relaxing the bronchial muscle. They are effective in helping older children and adults with asthma. However, unlike asthmatics, infants with bronchiolitis are usually wheezing for the first time. They are wheezing for a different reason, that is to say, because their airways are clogged with debris. Therefore, infants with bronchiolitis are less likely to respond to bronchodilators. 
Study characteristics 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of bronchodilators in infants with bronchiolitis. We found 30 trials that included a total of 1922 infants, in several countries. The evidence is current up to January 2014. We analyzed studies done in outpatient and inpatient settings separately. All bronchodilators were included in the review except for epinephrine because it is reviewed in another Cochrane review. Albuterol (otherwise known as salbutamol) is commonly used in studies, so we also reviewed this bronchodilator as a subgroup. 
Key results 
We found no effect of bronchodilators on oxygen saturation. Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis showed no significant benefit of bronchodilator treatment. This review also found that bronchodilators do not reduce the need for hospitalization, do not shorten the length of stay in hospital and do not shorten the length of the illness at home. Reviewing the subgroup of studies using albuterol (salbutamol), we found no effect of this bronchodilator on oxygen saturation or clinical scores. Side effects of bronchodilators include rapid heart beat, decrease in oxygen and shakiness. Given these side effects, little evidence that they are effective and the expense associated with these treatments, bronchodilators are not helpful in the management of bronchiolitis. 
Quality of the evidence 
This review is limited by the small number of studies that use the same measures and methods. For example, only 22 studies included only infants wheezing for the first time. Older studies included children who had wheezed before and may have had asthma. Thus these older studies favor the use of bronchodilators. Newer studies that excluded infants with prior wheezing and had a better study design do not show a benefit of bronchodilators. This review is also limited by the small number of infants included in each study. Lastly, clinical scores used to measure the effect of the bronchodilators in some studies may vary from one observer to the next, making this measure unreliable. Studies that include more infants, use better measures and have a stronger study design are needed to define the effectiveness of these medications.
