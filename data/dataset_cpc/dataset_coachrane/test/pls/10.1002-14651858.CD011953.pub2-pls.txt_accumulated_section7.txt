Interventions for treating central venous catheter malfunction
What is the issue? 
Patients who rely on haemodialysis due to kidney failure require vascular access and although not optimal, a tunnelled haemodialysis catheter is frequently used. Unfortunately, along with infection issues these lines are prone to dysfunction due to clotting and fibrin sheath formation. Medications such as alteplase have a recognised role in preventing line dysfunction but the best approach to treating established line dysfunction has not been found. 
What did we do? 
We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement. 
What did we find? 
We found eight studies involving 580 participants that tested the three different treatments. Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration. The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long‚Äêterm catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best. There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.
