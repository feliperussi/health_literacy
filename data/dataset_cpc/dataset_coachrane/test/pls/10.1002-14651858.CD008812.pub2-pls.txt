Comparing two different techniques of removing cataracts
Cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye and is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. The only method of treatment for this condition is surgery to remove the opacified lens and to replace it with a new lens, usually made of plastic. There are various surgical techniques for removing the lens, and in this review we compare two of them: phacoemulsification and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). 
A search was performed of the literature in May 2013 for studies comparing the two techniques and 11 randomised controlled trials were identified which included a total of 1228 participants. These trials included participants with age‐related cataract and were conducted in Europe, South America and the Far East. We evaluated these for any biases that may have affected the data, extracted data according to pre‐determined criteria and performed analyses of the pooled data from all studies where possible. 
There were few studies that reported outcomes which met our pre‐defined criteria. The studies were generally at unclear risk of bias due to poorly reported trial methods and the overall quality of the evidence for different outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. Phacoemulsification gave superior results at both three and 12‐month time points. Complications were higher in the ECCE group than the phacoemulsification group. However, two out of three studies that reported costs indicated that ECCE was cheaper than phacoemulsification. 
In summary, on the basis of the few studies that reported outcomes that we could include in our analysis, visual outcomes were better with phacoemulsification and complications were lower with this technique. However, ECCE was cheaper and in lower income countries ECCE may therefore have a role in maximising the number of people that can be treated with limited resources.
