Nurse‐ versus physician‐led care for the management of asthma
Asthma is a very common chronic condition and symptoms are breathlessness, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness. Symptoms may be persistent or intermittent. In order for asthma to be managed well, and symptoms controlled, regular visits to a healthcare professional are needed. During these visits, a number of aspects should be addressed (prescribing of medication, asthma self‐management education including inhaler technique assessment, written asthma treatment plans, self‐monitoring of symptoms and regular medical review). Consultations such as these, although important, are time‐consuming, placing a burden on healthcare resources and the workload of the doctors treating these patients. Since the 1990s, nurse‐led care has been introduced to treat people with asthma. We investigated if nurse‐led care is as effective as that delivered by a physician. 
We reviewed the medical literature to find randomised controlled trials on care delivered by specialised nurse compared to care by a doctor in the management of asthma. We found five studies on 588 adults and children. The studies were of good methodological quality. The number of asthma exacerbations (flare‐ups) and the level of asthma severity did not differ at the end of the study period between the intervention and the control group. Only one study reported information about the costs associated with both kinds of care and there was no significant difference between them. There was also no difference in quality of life. We found no difference between nurse‐led care and physician‐led care. Based on the relatively small number of studies in this review, nurse‐led care may be appropriate in patients with well‐controlled asthma. More studies in varied settings and among people with varying levels of asthma control are needed with data on adverse events and healthcare costs.
