Adding indoor residual spraying in communities using insecticide‐treated nets for the prevention of malaria 
What was the aim of this review? 
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the regular application of chemical insecticides to household walls. The insecticide lasts for several months, killing mosquitoes that land on them. Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) are bed nets treated with insecticides, preventing mosquitoes from biting people and reducing the mosquito population. Both interventions help to control malaria by reducing the number of people being bitten by mosquitoes infected with malaria. Implementing IRS in communities that are using ITNs may be better for malaria control than using ITNs alone simply because two interventions may be better than one; but also because it may improve malaria control where mosquitoes have become resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides used in ITNs. Pyrethroids were the only class of insecticides approved for use in ITNs until 2018, but growing resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids impairs their effectiveness. The addition of IRS could counteract this reduction in ITN effectiveness and may help to slow the emergence of pyrethroid resistance. We could expect that IRS insecticides that have a different way of working to pyrethroids ('non‐pyrethroid‐like') could restore effectiveness better than those that have the same way of working ('pyrethroid‐like'). The aim of this review was to summarize the impact of pyrethroid‐like or non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS on malaria, when implemented in communities that are using ITNs. 
Key messages 
The addition of IRS using a non‐pyrethroid‐like insecticide was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but this effect was absent in two studies, and consequently there remains some uncertainty over whether the intervention will be effective in all settings.
