Beta‐1 selective blockers for treatment of high blood pressure
Background 
Beta‐1 selective blockers are a subclass of beta blockers that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Drugs in this class include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nebivolol (Bystolic) and bisoprolol (Zebeta, Monocor). We developed a comprehensive methodology to examine how different doses and drugs in this class of drugs lower blood pressure. 
Characteristics of included studies 
We found and included 56 clinical trials examining the blood pressure lowering effect of eight beta‐1 blockers in 7812 people with high blood pressure. These participants were randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of beta‐1 blocker treatment or placebo for 3 weeks to 12 weeks. 
Key results 
On average, beta‐1 blockers lowered BP by ‐10 points of systolic and ‐8 points of diastolic pressure in people with mild to moderate high blood pressure. In general, higher doses of beta‐1 blockers did not show greater reduction of blood pressure compared to lower doses. The maximum blood pressure reduction was exhibited at twice the recommended starting dose. 
Higher doses of beta‐1 blockers lowered heart rate more than the lower doses, therefore are more likely to cause the common side effect of slowed heart rate. Beta‐1 selective blockers lower systolic and diastolic BP to a similar degree, as is the case for the other subclasses of beta blockers, and thus have little or no effect on pulse pressure. This is different from other classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was judged to be low due to various types of bias that could exaggerate the effect. A low quality of evidence means future research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
