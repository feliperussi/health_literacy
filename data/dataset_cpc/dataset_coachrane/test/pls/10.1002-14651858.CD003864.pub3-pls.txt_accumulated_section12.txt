Interventions for improving oral health in people after stroke
Review question 
We wanted to know whether oral healthcare (OHC) interventions improve the oral health of people who have had a stroke, and if any one OHC intervention provided more benefit than another approach. 
Background 
Three quarters of people who have had a stroke experience physical problems, and the weakness, lack of co‐ordination and cognitive (attention, memory, language and orientation) problems that may accompany a stroke can make it difficult for a person to maintain the health and cleanliness of their mouth, tongue and teeth on their own. A clean mouth feels good and the practice of OHC (removing dental plaque (a soft, sticky film that builds up on your teeth) and traces of food) is a crucial factor in maintaining the health of the mouth, teeth and gums. A clean and healthy mouth also prevents pain or discomfort and allows people to eat a range of nutritious foods. Maintaining good oral care may be difficult after a stroke and healthcare staff may have to assist in providing such care. 
We wanted to see whether OHC interventions could improve the cleanliness of stroke survivors' teeth by reducing dental plaque or denture plaque (our primary outcomes). We were also interested in whether OHC interventions would improve other (secondary) outcomes including patient satisfaction and quality of life, presence of oral disease, presence of related infection, and stroke survivor and providers' knowledge and attitudes to OHC.

Study characteristics 
We included 15 studies (22 comparisons) involving 1546 people with stroke, 1028 staff and 94 carers in this updated review. Seven trials compared OHC with usual care; three trials compared OHC with placebo (pretend treatment or usual care), and 12 trials compared two different types of OHC. 
Key results 
We found little evidence to inform how OHC is best delivered. There was low‐quality evidence from trials that compared OHC with standard care showing that OHC reduced denture plaque. There was no difference for studies that measured dental plaque. We found very low‐quality evidence to show that training nursing staff and family carers improved their knowledge and attitudes to OHC. There was low‐quality evidence that demonstrated the beneficial impact of a decontamination gel (to reduce the number of bacteria in the mouth) on the incidence of pneumonia compared with placebo gel among patients in a stroke ward. However, there was no other information on how best to provide OHC and more studies are urgently needed.
