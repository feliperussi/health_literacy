Treatments for broken kneecaps in adults
Broken kneecaps (patella fractures) account for 1% of all fractures. There are many treatments for these fractures and they can be treated with surgery or conservatively (any treatment where surgery is not used). Conservative interventions include cast immobilisation, knee brace and immobilisation by traction. Surgery can be open, percutaneous (minimally invasive surgery that uses small incisions) or arthroscopic (using two mini‐incisions with the help of an internal camera). The implants used to fix the fracture can be metallic or non‐metallic implants, and can be wires, screws, plates, threads, strings, suture buttons, external fixators, rods, nails and combinations of these. 
Aim of review 
This review aimed to evaluate the effects of different methods for treating kneecap fractures in adults, with or without surgery. The main outcomes we were interested in were patient‐rated knee function, knee pain and complications (adverse events). 
Search results and quality of the evidence 
We searched the scientific literature to January 2020 and found 11 relevant studies with 564 participants. Participants in these studies were aged between 16 and 76 years. There were 340 men and 212 women; the gender of 12 participants was not reported. Seven trials were conducted in China and one each in Finland, Mexico, Pakistan and Turkey. All 11 studies compared different types of surgery or surgical devices. Thus, we found no studies comparing different types of conservative treatment or surgery versus conservative treatment. 
The 11 studies made seven comparisons. We judged the evidence available for each comparison was of very low quality. This was mainly because all the trials had design flaws that put them at high risk of bias and the studies were also small with few events.
