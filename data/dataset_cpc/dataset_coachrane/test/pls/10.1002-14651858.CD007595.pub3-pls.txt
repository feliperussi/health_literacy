Repeated use of hormonal drugs right before or after sex to prevent pregnancy
Currently, no oral birth control method is approved for using only when needed, that is, at the time of sex. However, many women may want to use such a method. Our review looked at studies of different drugs taken around the sex act to find out how well the drugs worked to prevent pregnancy. We also assessed the safety of the drugs and whether women liked them. 
We ran computer searches until 1 September 2014 to find relevant studies in any language. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers to find other trials. We assessed the quality of the research methods in the studies. We used the Pearl Index to estimate the effect. The Pearl Index is the number of pregnancies for every 100 years of pill use. 
We found 22 studies from the past 40 years. They included a total of 12,400 women in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Fifteen trials studied different doses of the hormone levonorgestrel and seven looked at other hormones. These studies showed that using some hormones right before or after sex did prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel seemed to work well, and was safe and accepted by thousands of women in several large trials. The most common side effects were menstrual bleeding problems. However, such bleeding issues were not always related to how often women took the pills or the total dose of the drug. 
Most studies were old and many reports were not complete. However, the data had moderate quality because of the many women in these studies, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results. We do not know for sure whether using levonorgestrel repeatedly around the time of sex is a good and safe method of birth control. More high‚Äêquality research is needed to answer the question.
