Braces and orthoses for osteoarthritis of the knee
Research question 
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of braces and foot/ankle orthoses in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. We searched for evidence up to March 2014. We found 13 studies (n = 1356) and included in this update six additional studies (n = 529 participants). 
Study characteristics 
We included studies reporting results in patients with early to severe knee OA (Kellgren & Lawrence grade I‐IV) treated with a knee brace (valgus knee brace, neutral brace, neoprene sleeve) or an orthosis (laterally or medially wedged insole, neutral insole, variable or constant stiffness shoe) or given no treatment. 
Background: What is osteoarthritis and what are braces and orthoses? 
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that protects the ends of bones breaks down, causing pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis can occur in different areas of the knee or can affect the whole knee. Depending on the area, osteoarthritis can change the alignment of joints. 
Braces and orthoses are devices that you wear to support your knee joint. Orthoses are insoles that fit comfortably inside your shoes. Braces are made of combinations of metal, foam, plastic, elastic material and straps. A knee brace can be fitted specially for the person wearing it. 
Key results 
This review shows the following in people with osteoarthritis of the knee.
Wearing a knee brace compared with no brace: 
• may result in little or no difference in reducing pain and improving knee function and quality of life after 12 months (low‐quality evidence); and • causes many patients to stop their initial treatment because of lack of effect in both groups.
