Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy
What is the issue? 
The term 'constipation' is defined as difficulty in passing stool and reduced frequency of bowel movements. It is characterised by discomfort, excessive straining, hard or lumpy stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation, and infrequent bowel movements. Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. This can result from a combination of factors, including changes in hormones during pregnancy affecting the digestive system, reduced physical activity and changes in dietary habits during pregnancy. In addition, as the baby grows it can press on the mother's intestines and cause digestive delays/obstructions. 
Why is this important? 
Constipation during pregnancy is associated with impaired quality of life and distress for pregnant women as well as physical problems including, occasionally, haemorrhoids. There are a range of suggested treatments with drugs, supplements or dietary modifications. 
Generally, non‐pharmacological interventions (changes in diet, water intake and exercise) are recommended initially, followed by pharmacological interventions if the non‐pharmacological interventions fail or are insufficient. Pharmacological interventions include medications from a wide range of drug classes including lubricants, bulk‐forming agents, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas and suppositories. 
This review looked at the benefits of drug and non‐drug interventions for constipation in pregnancy and whether they are safe for women and babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We identified four studies, but only two studies (with a total of 180 women) provided data for analysis.The studies looked at stimulant laxatives compared with bulk‐forming laxatives and dietary fibre supplementation versus no intervention. The included studies were judged to be of moderate quality. 
We looked at two main comparisons. In the first, we found that stimulant laxatives may be more effective in improving constipation than bulk‐forming laxatives (moderate quality evidence) but may also cause more abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and we found no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). However, when we removed data relating to an intervention called Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone), which is no longer routinely used in pregnancy, there was no longer a clear difference between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
The second comparison, between fibre supplementation and no intervention, found that fibre supplementation may be effective in increasing the frequency of stools (moderate quality evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
There were no studies that looked at others types of interventions like osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
What does this mean? 
What little evidence there is, suggests that dietary fibre supplementation may increase the frequency of stools. If choosing between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives, then stimulant may relieve constipation better but may cause more abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea.
