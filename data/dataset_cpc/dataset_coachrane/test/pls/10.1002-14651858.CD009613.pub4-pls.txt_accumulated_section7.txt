Methods for monitoring blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes to improve outcomes
What is the issue and why is this important? 
If a mother already has diabetes when she becomes pregnant, she and her baby are at higher risk of various problems. Women with existing diabetes that is not well‐controlled at conception and in the first three months of pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage, having a baby with developmental problems or stillbirth. The baby is also at increased risk of developing diabetes in childhood. Problems for mothers include developing high blood pressure and associated ill‐health, early births, large babies, difficult births and the need for caesarean section. During labour the baby is at increased risk of a shoulder becoming stuck (shoulder dystocia) and of bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage). After birth the baby is more likely to have low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), jaundice and breathing problems. This means they are more likely to be admitted to intensive care. During pregnancy, the mother will have her blood glucose (sugar) levels monitored so appropriate steps can be taken to control her blood sugar. 
Several methods of monitoring blood glucose are used, including regular testing at antenatal clinics and self‐monitoring by women at home. The timing varies, such as monitoring before meals versus monitoring after meals, and how often levels are measured. For continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), technologies are used to transfer information directly from the woman to her clinician and include telemedicine (telephone and video systems, information technology) and digital technologies (mobile phones, tablets). The aim of these methods is to provide a more accurate measure of blood sugar levels so that they can be more effectively controlled, in order to reduce potential problems. 
What evidence did we find? 
This is an update of a review first published in 2014, updated in 2017. We searched for evidence from randomised controlled studies in November 2018. We identified 12 studies involving 944 women (type 1 diabetes: 660 women; type 2 diabetes: 113 women; in two trials (171 women) there was a mix of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The trials were from Europe, USA and Canada. 
There were six comparisons. These were: continuous versus intermittent monitoring of blood glucose (four studies, 609 women); two different ways of self‐monitoring (two studies, 43 women); self‐monitoring at home versus hospitalisation to control blood glucose levels (one study, 100 women); blood glucose monitoring before a meal (pre‐prandial) versus blood glucose monitoring after a meal (post‐prandial) (one study, 61 women); automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional care (three studies, 84 women); and constant continuous monitoring versus intermittent continuous monitoring (one study, 25 women),
