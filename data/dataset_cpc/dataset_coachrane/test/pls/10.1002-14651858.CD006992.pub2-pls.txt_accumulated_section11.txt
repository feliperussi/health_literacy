Combinations of insulin and oral glucose‐lowering drugs for people with type 2 diabetes on insulin treatment 
Introduction 
Many guidelines on type 2 diabetes recommend a glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level below 7%. HbA1c levels in the blood express glucose or glycaemic control over a longer time period (two to three months). During the course of type 2 diabetes it will get more difficult to reach these levels with 'lifestyle' modification (diet, exercise or both) and oral glucose‐lowering agents alone. Finally, a substantial number of people will need insulin therapy for better glycaemic control. Insulin therapy can be initiated as insulin alone, called monotherapy (which means that oral glucose‐lowering medication will be stopped) or in combination with oral glucose‐lowering agents. In the former case, oral blood glucose‐lowering agents can be added at a later stage, if insulin monotherapy fails to achieve a good HbA1c level. Hypoglycaemia and weight gain are the most common and well known side effects of insulin therapy. Adding oral agents to insulin could reduce the required insulin dose and thus decrease these insulin‐related side effects. However, there could be other side effects specific to the various oral blood glucose‐lowering drugs. 
Review question 
To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy and the addition of an oral antidiabetic drug in people with type 2 diabetes already treated with insulin but not having good glycaemic control. 
Background 
It is unclear whether people with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin alone who do not achieve good glucose levels should continue with insulin alone or can benefit from adding an oral antidiabetic drug to their insulin therapy. 
Study characteristics 
All 37 included studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups). Their duration ranged from 2 to 12 months. The total number of participants was 3227. Several types of insulin monotherapy (once‐daily long‐ or intermediate‐acting insulin, twice‐daily premixed insulin, multiple injection therapy with short‐acting insulin) were compared with different types of additional antidiabetic tablets: sulphonylureas (such as glibenclamide/glyburide), metformin, alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose), pioglitazone and DPP‐4 inhibitors (such as saxagliptin). 
Key results 
The addition of oral agents to insulin monotherapy reduced HbA1c by 0.4% to 1%. Most combinations of oral antidiabetic agents with insulin resulted in a reduction in the necessary insulin dose per day whereas the insulin dose per day had to be increased or remained stable in participants with insulin monotherapy. In studies reporting hypoglycaemic episodes severe events were rare and mild to moderate hypoglycaemia was observed in similar numbers when comparing insulin monotherapy to the addition of oral antidiabetic agents to insulin. However, most studies adding sulphonylureas to insulin reported more hypoglycaemic episodes. Moreover, the addition of sulphonylureas to insulin resulted in an additional weight gain of 0.4 kg to 1.9 kg compared with ‐0.8 kg to 2.1 kg in the insulin monotherapy groups. Pioglitazone insulin combination therapy caused on average an increase in weight of 3.8 kg compared with insulin monotherapy. The difference in average weight gain with metformin insulin combination therapy compared with insulin monotherapy was 2.1 kg less in favour of the combination therapy. Gastro‐intestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhoea were mostly reported with metformin and alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors. Addition of pioglitazone to insulin compared with insulin monotherapy resulted in more cases of oedema (fluid retention in the body) and heart failure. Only one study assessed participants' treatment satisfaction and showed no substantial differences between the addition of glimepiride or metformin and glimepiride to insulin compared with insulin monotherapy. No study assessed all‐cause mortality, diabetes‐related morbidity or health‐related quality of life.
