Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a fatal disease in which the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that control movement degenerate. Treatments have little effect on how the disease progresses. People with ALS develop muscle weakness and paralysis of limb muscles and muscles involved in swallowing and breathing. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a method for exciting nerve cells in superficial areas of the brain. It applies pulsed magnetic fields to the surface of the brain via an electrode on the scalp. There have been trials to see if rTMS is effective in people with ALS. 
For this review we searched widely for clinical trials of rTMS in people with ALS and found three studies, which involved 50 participants in total. All three compared rTMS with sham (inactive) rTMS. None of the three studies reported on disability or limitation in activity as assessed by a specific ALS scale (ALSFRS‐R) at six months follow‐up, which was what we chose as our primary measure of the effectiveness of rTMS. Other outcome measures were only available from 12 participants in one poor quality trial, in which there was no difference between rTMS and sham rTMS in ALSFRS‐R or a test of muscle strength at 12 months’ follow‐up. None of the studies reported any adverse effects with rTMS. The trials in this review had small numbers of participants and some problems of design, so larger, well‐designed trials should be considered, to determine the efficacy and safety of rTMS in ALS. However, the potential benefit should be balanced against the impact of taking part in trials for people with ALS.
