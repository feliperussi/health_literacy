Can community pharmacy interventions help improve pharmacy workers' skills and pharmacy users' health outcomes through health promotion? 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to find out whether interventions that support people to change health behaviours, and are delivered in community pharmacies, can change the way that pharmacy workers interact with pharmacy users and can improve health outcomes for those users. 
Key messages 
Community pharmacies and their workers may have an important part to play in health promotion, and probably improve the health outcomes of pharmacy users slightly, at an acceptable cost and with no evidence of harm (adverse events may or may not have occurred, this is unclear as no adverse effects were reported by the studies). 
What was studied in the review? 
Community pharmacies are an easy place for many people to access healthcare advice. In the past this advice was limited to how best to take medicines, but, increasingly, community pharmacy workers are carrying out other activities, such as giving advice on healthy eating and management of long‐term conditions. While some community pharmacy workers may offer the sale of products without a strong evidence‐base, the professional guidance issued to pharmacists has attempted to reduce these transactions, and has placed more emphasis on developing evidence‐based public health services. Many people find health‐related lifestyle and self‐management behaviours difficult. Pharmacies may be convenient for people to use, but it is important to understand whether health‐promoting activities delivered in pharmacies are worthwhile and effective, so that those responsible for commissioning health care can decide whether it is worth spending resources to support them.
