Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children
Review question 
How do antibiotics compare with placebo or no treatment for reducing or treating persistent respiratory symptoms in children following acute bronchiolitis? 
Background 
Bronchiolitis is a lung condition that commonly affects children across the world. Young children with bronchiolitis normally have a cough, fast and difficult breathing, and poor feeding. Antibiotics are not usually prescribed unless the illness is severe, or a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. However, some children continue to have ongoing problems (i.e. wheeze, cough) after the acute infection (> 14 days), increasing the risk of ongoing burden of disease and costs to the health system. These children often re‐present for further medical care in the community (general practitioners and health providers) or in hospital (emergency departments). Antibiotics used to treat these ongoing symptoms may get rid of bacteria in the lungs and may improve long‐term outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
This review update (up to 26 August 2016) includes two clinical trials that compared antibiotics with placebo for children in the post‐acute bronchiolitis phase (> 14 days). The first was reported from Turkey and enrolled 30 infants aged seven months or younger. The second was reported from Australia and New Zealand and enrolled 249 infants aged 24 months or younger. Both trials initiated treatment during hospitalisation for bronchiolitis and provided follow‐up for six months post hospitalisation. 
Key results 
This review update includes a total of two trials with 249 children (n = 240 completed). Both studies contributed to primary and secondary outcomes, but the quality of evidence was low. Review authors noted no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow‐up, and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months; nor for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months. One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours. One study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study.
