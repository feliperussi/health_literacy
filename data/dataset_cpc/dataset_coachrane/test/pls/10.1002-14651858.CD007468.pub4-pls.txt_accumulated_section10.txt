Surgical operation for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis)
Review question 
What are the effects of early surgery in the management of Bell's palsy, compared with no treatment, operations performed after three months, other types of surgery, sham (fake) treatment or treatment with medicines? 
Background 
Bell's palsy is a paralysis of the facial muscles, usually one sided, that has no known underlying cause (idiopathic). The symptoms probably occur when a nerve in the face is trapped and swollen. People with Bell's palsy generally recover, often with help from steroid medication, but there is a small group who do not. Some surgeons have thought that operating as soon as possible (within three months of the onset of paralysis) to free the nerve could improve recovery. 
Study characteristics 
Cochrane review authors collected and analysed studies to answer the review question. We found two studies to include in our review, which involved 65 people with Bell's palsy. Our main measure of the effects of surgery was the complete recovery of paralysis at 12 months. The first study compared surgery with no treatment and the second study compared early surgery with late surgery and no treatment. Both studies reported no conflicts of interest. One study did not provide funding information, the other reported national and regional science programme and university funding. 
Key results and reliability of the evidence 
Evidence on the effects of early surgery for Bell's palsy is of very‚Äêlow reliability because the trials are small and have very serious limitations. We are unable to say whether recovery is better or worse after early surgery (before three months) than with no treatment, or after early surgery compared to later surgery. 
One study reported side effects or complications of surgery. The reliability of this evidence was very low. Four participants who had surgery had some hearing loss, and three experienced tinnitus (ringing in the ears). The surgery group showed some loss of control of tear production in the eyes.
