Interventions to improve sleep in adults and children with kidney disease
What is the issue? 
People with kidney disease can have severe sleep problems related to use of medications, depression, anxiety, pain, and itch that impact on the quality of sleep itself, including the time it takes to get to sleep, staying asleep, and the total time spent sleeping. Kidney disease is linked to sleep disordered breathing that can decrease sleep quality. We looked at whether treatment could help improve the quality of sleep for people who have kidney disease. We looked for studies that included children and adults with kidney disease, including those who were treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. 
What did we do? 
We looked at electronic databases to find research studies of any treatment that was designed to help with sleep problems. Studies needed to be randomised (in other words, patients needed to have an equal chance that they might receive one of the treatments in the study). We collected information from the studies and combined this to identify whether treatment was helpful or if there were important side‐effects. We looked at how certain we could be that the treatments had any effects based on how well the studies were conducted (quality). The information in this review is up to date as of October 2018. 
What did we find? 
We found 67 studies that involved 3427 adults. We found no studies for children. The treatments for sleep included relaxation, exercise, medicines, education, psychological support, acupressure, music, aromatherapy, and massage. Generally, the studies were small and most did not tell us about the benefits and safety of the treatments. We did not find good information about relaxation, exercise, or medicines. We found that acupressure may reduce the amount of time it takes to get to sleep and may increase the time spent asleep. But these effects on sleep were not seen when acupressure was compared against "pretend" or "sham" acupressure. There was not enough information to learn about side‐effects of treatments, or to know about treatments that are designed to help improve breathing when asleep.
