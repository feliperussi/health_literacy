Intravesical gemcitabine for non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
In people with tumors of the superficial layer of the urinary bladder (namely non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC]), how does gemcitabine that is put into the bladder compare to other medicines after the tumor has been removed?  
Background 
NMIBC can be taken out of the bladder using small instruments and a light source (called transurethral surgery). However, these tumors often come back (recurrence) with an aggressive feature such as spread into the deep layers of the bladder. To prevent this, we can put various medicines into the bladder. In this review, we wanted to know whether gemcitabine (a chemotherapy medication) was better or worse than other medicines. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 11 September 2020. We included only studies in which chance determined whether people received gemcitabine or other medicines. We found seven studies with 1222 participants. Two studies compared gemcitabine versus saline. One study compared gemcitabine versus mitomycin (a chemotherapy medication). Three studies compared gemcitabine versus BCG (Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin; a medicine used to help keep cancer from growing). One study compared gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG. 
Key results 
Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time, but may have a similar effect on progression (cancer getting worse) and severe unwanted effects compared to saline. Gemcitabine may prevent recurrence and progression compared to mitomycin. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to mitomycin. In people who had a high‐risk NMIBC with the cancer coming back after one course of treatment with BCG, gemcitabine may cause less tumor recurrence and progression compared to giving BCG again. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to BCG retreatment. The review also includes information on how gemcitabine compares to BCG and how it compares to one‐third dose BCG.
