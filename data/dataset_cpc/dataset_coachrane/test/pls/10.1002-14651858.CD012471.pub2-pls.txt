Information for adult intensive care unit patients and their carers
Background 
During intensive care unit (ICU) admission, patients and their carers experience physical and psychological stressors that may lead to increased anxiety, depression, and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Improving communication among patients, their carers, and doctors, nurses, and other ICU staff may improve these outcomes. Communication may include information or educational interventions, in different formats, which aim to improve knowledge of the patient's condition, their treatment plan, or challenges they may face after ICU discharge. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current up to 10 April 2017. We included eight studies with 1157 ICU patients and 943 carers of ICU patients. Seven studies are awaiting classification because we could not assess their eligibility, and three studies are ongoing. We included studies that assessed information given to patients or their carers compared to no information, and studies that assessed information as part of a more complex intervention compared to a complex intervention that did not include information or education. Studies included varied information: standardised or tailored to the individual, given regularly or on a single occasion, and that included verbal or written information, audio recordings, multimedia information, and interactive information packs. 
Key results 
Overall, it is uncertain whether information or education (given alone or as part of a more complex intervention) improves outcomes for patients and their carers following a stay in the ICU. For patients, it is uncertain whether or not information or education reduces anxiety or depression, or improves health‐related quality of life. One patient asked to withdraw from the study because they believed that their mental health worsened when they completed a questionnaire to assess anxiety and depression, but it is not clear whether this person received the information intervention or not. No studies reported PTSD in patients. For carers, it is uncertain whether or not information or education reduces anxiety or depression or improves carers' knowledge acquisition or their satisfaction with information provided. 
Quality of the evidence 
It was not possible for researchers to mask patients and carers to the intervention they received, and it was unclear whether this would affect the results, which relied on self assessments. Study authors did not consistently report rigorous methods for carrying out randomised trials, and we noted some losses of patients and carers during the studies. We found few small studies for this review, reporting limited data for many outcomes of interest. It is uncertain whether information or education is effective due to very low‐certainty evidence. 
Conclusion 
We are uncertain about the effects of information or education interventions given to adult ICU patients and their carers. The evidence was of very low certainty, and our confidence in the evidence was limited. We are aware of three ongoing studies and seven studies that were recently completed but not yet published. These studies may provide additional evidence or improve the certainty in the findings in future updates of the review.
