Thyroxine replacement therapy for subfertile women with autoimmune thyroid disease or mildly underactive thyroid 
Review question 
Does hormone supplementation with thyroxine (levothyroxine) improve fertility outcomes after in vitro fertilisation (a fertility treatment where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (a fertility treatment where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg) for women diagnosed with presence of thyroid antibodies (autoimmune thyroid disease; ATD) or mildly underactive thyroid? 
Background 
Thyroid disease is the second most common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Research has shown a higher rate of miscarriage and reduced fertility in women with underactive (slow‐working) thyroid, with both thyroid hormones measured in blood testing being low. However, there is also a mild variant of this thyroid disease, the so‐called 'subclinical' or mildly underactive thyroid in which affected people show no symptoms and only have a mild change in one of the thyroid hormones when testing blood levels. Another mild variant of thyroid disease is the so‐called 'ATD,' with normal thyroid hormone levels, but the presence of thyroid antibodies. Antibodies could attack a woman's own body cells, and the presence of thyroid antibodies is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage. To date, it is unclear what these mild subtypes of thyroid disease do to female fertility and pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
Cochrane authors performed a comprehensive literature search of the standard medical databases to 8 April 2019 in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Information Specialist, for randomised clinical trials (RCTs: clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating the effect of thyroid hormones (levothyroxine) for women diagnosed with ATD or mildly underactive thyroid who were planning to undergo assisted reproduction. Two authors independently selected studies, evaluated them, extracted data and attempted to contact the authors where data were missing. 
We found four RCTs (with 820 women) that met our inclusion requirements. The thyroid hormones were administered in a range of doses to women diagnosed with mildly underactive thyroid or presence of thyroid antibodies (ATD). 
Key results 
In women with mild thyroid hormone imbalance and unknown thyroid autoimmunity status, we were uncertain whether thyroxine replacement had an effect on live birth or miscarriage rates (very low‐quality evidence from one study involving 70 women). 
In women with mildly underactive thyroids (with or without ATD), the evidence suggested that thyroxine replacement may have improved live birth rates (low‐quality evidence from one study involving 64 women) and it may have led to similar miscarriage rates (low‐quality evidence from one study involving 64 women). The evidence suggested that women with mildly underactive thyroid (with or without ATD) would have a 25% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and 27% to 100% with thyroxine. 
In women with ATD and normal thyroid function, treatment with thyroxine replacement compared with placebo or no treatment may have led to similar live birth rates (low‐quality evidence from two studies involving 686 women) and miscarriage rates (low quality evidence from two studies involving 686 women). The evidence suggested that women with ATD and normal thyroid function would have a 31% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and 26% to 40% with thyroxine.
