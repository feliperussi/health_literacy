Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Repeated chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis cause inflammation and damage to the lungs which, in the long term, is the most common reason for death. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation, but may cause some side effects. Some of these side effects are less serious, e.g., oral thrush, but others are more serious, such as reduced growth rate in childhood. This is an update of a previously published review and due to a lack of research in this area, we do not plan any further updates.

Study characteristics 
In this updated review, 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis. In most of the trials participants started taking steroids or placebo (treatment that appeared the same as the steroids, but did not have any active medicine in it) at the start of the trial, but one trial was a withdrawal trial (171 participants), where everyone was already taking steroids and while half of them carried on, the rest took a placebo, in effect stopping the treatment. Participants were aged between 6 and 55 years; three of the trials were in children only, four in adults only and four were mixed ages; two trials did not describe the ages of the people taking part. The lung function and severity of disease of the participants varied across trials and only two trials gave information about their genetic mutations. All trials took place in Europe. In 10 of the trials, all those taking part remained in the same group up to the end of the trial (either a treatment group or a group receiving no treatment or a placebo), but in three trials they swapped groups halfway through the trial. The trials lasted between three weeks and two years.
