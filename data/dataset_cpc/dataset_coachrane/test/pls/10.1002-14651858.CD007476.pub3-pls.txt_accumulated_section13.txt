Deferasirox for managing iron overload in people with thalassaemia
Background 
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to a defect in the production of haemoglobin. Regular red blood cell transfusions are needed, particularly for the severe form of the disease, thalassaemia major. This results in iron overload. Since the human body has no means of actively getting rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (iron‐chelating drugs) is needed. Several years ago, a newer oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. 
Review question 
Does deferasirox offer advantages compared to placebo or to the other iron chelators deferoxamine or deferiprone in people with thalassaemia with regard to effectiveness and safety? 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 12 August 2016. This updated review includes 16 randomised controlled studies (1807 participants) containing 20 comparisons of deferasirox versus another treatment. 
In people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, two studies compared deferasirox with placebo and nine studies (1251 participants) compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone. One study each compared deferasirox and deferiprone respectively to deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy (40 participants), deferasirox and deferoxamine combination therapy to deferoxamine alone (94 participants) and deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy (96 participants). 
In people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassemia (individuals not requiring regular blood transfusions), one study (166 participants) compared deferasirox to placebo. The duration of the included studies ranged from 12 days to two years. 
Key results 
Two studies comparing deferasirox with placebo in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox was effective at removing iron. Nine other studies compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Similar effectiveness seems possible, depending of the doses of the two drugs compared. It needs to be confirmed whether this leads to similar improvements in patient‐important outcomes in the long run. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; however, rarer adverse events or long‐term side effects could not be adequately investigated due to the limited number of participants and the relatively short duration of the studies. Patient satisfaction was significantly better with deferasirox among those who had previously been treated with deferoxamine. The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs. Deferasirox may be an alternative for those individuals who do not tolerate, or have poor adherence with, deferoxamine. In people with a strong preference to deferasirox, potential benefits and risks should be discussed. 
One study (41 participants) reported that more individuals with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia experienced joint pain when treated with deferiprone than with deferasirox, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared, this result may be due to chance. One study revealed that adherence to treatment was higher when both oral iron chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone are used than the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participant discontinued the study. We found no evidence for any differences comparing deferasirox or deferiprone alone to combined deferasirox and deferiprone treatment or deferasirox and deferoxamine combination to deferoxamine alone, but the numbers of people in the studies were small and available data were very limited. 
One study in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia found deferasirox was better at reducing serum ferritin and liver iron concentration compared to placebo. However, there is no evidence on the impact on patient‐important outcomes or long‐term safety data in this population.
