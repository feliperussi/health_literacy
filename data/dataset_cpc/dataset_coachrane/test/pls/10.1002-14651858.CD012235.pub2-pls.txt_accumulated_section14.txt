Treatments for ulcers (wounds) and other skin changes in people with leprosy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of treatments (e.g. education, self‐care, dressings, skin care, or footwear) designed to prevent or treat skin damage in people with leprosy and those with potential damage to peripheral nerves. Treatments could be compared against usual care, no treatment, or another treatment. Evidence is current to July 2018. 
Background 
Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is a long‐lasting, infectious global disease, which may lead to complications like injuries and development of wounds (ulcers), particularly on the feet. Long‐term nerve and muscle damage impacts a person's quality of life, leading to mental and financial difficulties. Late diagnosis is the greatest cause of disability, so the key to effective management is early diagnosis and treatment, and early recognition and management of nerve damage, combined with effective health education to prevent limb damage. This review aimed to address uncertainties regarding the best way to prevent and treat skin damage. 
Study characteristics 
We included 14 trials (854 participants with leprosy). Participants mostly had only one wound on one foot. Wounds were mainly simple (not infected) and varied in size and depth, and were less than one year old; some wounds were more complicated. Participants ranged from 18 to 74 years old. In the 11 studies which reported gender, more men were included. Studies were conducted in Brazil, Ethiopia, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, and India, in mainly outpatient clinics. Most studies did not report funding sources. 
Treatments were mostly compared to dry dressings or dressings soaked in differing solutions. Other comparisons included special plaster, canvas shoes, and foot soak. 
Key results 
Treatments evaluated included: laser therapy, light‐emitting diode (LED), zinc tape or paste, pentoxifylline injections, exposure to pulsed magnetic fields, wax therapy, ketanserin gel, amniotic membrane gel, phenytoin powder, plaster shoes, and footwear. Outcomes were measured from the beginning of treatment. The following key results are based on very low‐certainty evidence, so we are not sure of these results. 
Three studies compared zinc tape with other interventions: magnesium sulphate glycerin, povidone iodine, or gauze soaked in Eusol. After one month of treatment, the number of healed ulcers was higher and the ulcer area was lower in the zinc tape group compared with magnesium sulphate glycerin. There was no clear difference in the reduction of ulcer area at six weeks when comparing zinc tape to povidone iodine. The healing time for deep ulcers in the zinc tape group was 17 days compared to 30 days with gauze soaked in Eusol. This study also reported no signs of skin sensitisation in either group at two months; the other two studies provided no data on adverse events. 
Two studies compared topical phenytoin to salt water dressing. One study showed a greater reduction in ulcer area with phenytoin. The other study found a greater reduction in ulcer volume in favour of phenytoin. Both studies measured this outcome after four weeks of treatment. No adverse events were observed in either study. 
The five studies just described did not assess prevention of ulcers, as the therapies were for treatment rather than prevention. 
Two studies compared protective footwear (with or without self‐care) with either polyvinyl chloride (PVC ‐ a form of plastic) boots, or pulsed magnetic fields plus self‐care and protective footwear. In the study comparing canvas shoes versus PVC boots, none of the participants who had scars at the start developed new ulcers over one year. There was no clear difference between the groups in the number of people whose ulcers had healed. In the study assessing pulsed magnetic fields, prevention of new ulcers was not measured; however, there was no clear difference between groups in volume of ulcers four to five weeks after the start of treatment. Only one study reported information about adverse events: the PVC boots could become very hot in strong sunlight, with the possibility of burning.
