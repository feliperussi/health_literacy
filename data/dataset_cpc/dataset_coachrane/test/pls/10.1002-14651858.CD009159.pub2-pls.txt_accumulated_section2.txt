Anti‐thymocyte globulins for the prevention of graft‐versus‐host disease in patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
Allogeneic haematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic option for a variety of malignant and some non‐malignant haematological (blood‐related) diseases. For this therapy, blood stem cells are transferred from a healthy person who has compatible tissue markers, so‐called human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers, to a matched recipient. Even though the donor and the recipient are matched concerning these markers, immune cells that are part of the transferred cells ('the graft') are prone to recognise tissues of the recipient ('the host') as being to some extent incompatible or foreign, which then can induce inflammation ('graft‐versus‐host‐disease' or 'GVHD'). GVHD typically involves the skin, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. GVHD is divided into acute and chronic forms based on the clinical features and the time of occurrence after transplantation. In order to prevent this potentially life‐threatening condition, reactive immune cells can be depleted in the recipient by administering antibodies which are directed against them. These antibodies are called anti‐thymocyte globulins (ATG) and are derived from animals which were immunised with human thymocytes or T‐cells. Different types of ATG have been used for decades to decrease the occurrence and severity of GVHD but they bear the risk of severe side effects such as increased infection rates or the risk of disease relapse. Also, severe side effects such as allergic reactions or serum sickness with shortness of breath and fever, blood coagulation disturbances or liver failure can harm the patient during the infusion of ATG. So far, no systematic analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of ATG has been done.
