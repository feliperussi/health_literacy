Dopamine agonists for restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by an urge to move the limbs which is usually associated with unpleasant sensations. Symptoms are worse during rest, in the evening, and at night and improve by movement. The course of the disorder is usually chronic. Dopamine agonists are recommended as first‐line treatment for RLS.  
We could include 38 trials in the meta‐analyses which investigated the efficacy and safety of dopamine agonist treatment compared to placebo or to other treatments for RLS. The studies were performed mostly in European and Northern American countries. Treatment durations varied from one week to seven months, but most treatments had durations of one to 12 weeks. Patients suffered from moderate to severe RLS and were treated with the dopamine agonists cabergoline, lisuride, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, and sumanirole. 
Dopamine agonists lead to a larger improvement on the International RLS Severity Rating Scale (IRLS) compared to placebo. Clinicians rated RLS symptoms as more improved with dopamine agonists compared to placebo (CGI‐I). Also periodic limb movements in sleep were significantly reduced by dopamine agonists compared to placebo. Sleep efficiency was also slightly improved. Patients rated their quality of sleep and quality of life as markedly improved. Patients were, however, more likely to discontinue dopamine agonist treatment and experienced more adverse events when treated with dopamine agonists compared to placebo. All dopamine agonists were superior to placebo except sumanirole. Indirect descriptive comparisons revealed the highest efficacy for the ergoline dopamine agonists cabergoline and pergolide, which has to be weighed against potentially serious side effects such as cardiac valve fibrosis. The non‐ergoline dopamine agonists lisuride, pramipexole, rotigotine, and ropinirole showed adequate efficacy. 
Augmentation, a serious adverse event in dopaminergic treatment, has not been sufficiently assessed. Future studies need to investigate long‐term efficacy of dopamine agonists against placebo or other active treatment and the frequency and the impact of augmentation on treatment outcome during dopaminergic treatment.
