Do video‐assisted instruments for inserting breathing tubes in adults work better than direct‐view instruments and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
Devices called laryngoscopes are used to help medical staff to insert a plastic breathing tube into someone’s windpipe because they need help with their breathing. A video camera can be attached to the device. We found that videolaryngoscopes generally improve the success of inserting a breathing tube compared with conventional laryngoscopes. 
What is intubation? 
People who are very ill or having surgery under general anaesthesia may need help to breathe. Trained medical staff may need to place a flexible plastic tube into a person’s windpipe. This is called intubation. It will keep the airway open so that the person can be given help to breathe. 
What are laryngoscopes? 
During intubation, the medical staff need to move the tongue and soft tissues of the mouth so that they can see the vocal cords before inserting the tube. To achieve this they use a laryngoscope. However, seeing the vocal cords may be difficult, for example when the person has restricted neck movement. Difficulties in intubation may lead to complications, including low oxygen levels and in extreme cases death. 
In this review, we looked at two types of laryngoscopes: Macintosh direct laryngoscopes and videolaryngoscopes. A Macintosh direct laryngoscope is a curved piece of metal or plastic with a handle designed to hold down the tongue and soft tissues. A videolaryngoscope uses video technology and allows medical staff to see the position of the tube on a video screen while it is being inserted. There are three main designs of videolaryngoscopes: Macintosh‐style (with a similar shape to the traditional laryngoscope), hyperangulated (more curved than other laryngoscopes), and channelled (with a groove to guide the breathing tube). 
What is laryngoscopy? 
Laryngoscopy is a medical procedure in which a device called a laryngoscope is used to examine the voice box and help with insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe to protect the airways during anaesthesia or when patients have breathing difficulties. 'Direct laryngoscopes' rely on a direct line of sight to the voice box to achieve this. A 'videolaryngoscope' incorporates video technology that allows the voice box to be viewed on a screen during the procedure. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out which type of laryngoscope works best for intubation for medical staff and patients. Which type of laryngoscope works best for certain groups of patients: for example, those with neck restrictions or obesity, different medical staff (experienced or less experienced) and in different settings (in or out of hospital). We also wanted to find out if any of the laryngoscopes cause unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared Macintosh laryngoscopes against each of the three different types of videolaryngoscopes.  We compared and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study design, methods and numbers of participants. 
What did we find? 
We found 222 studies with 26,149 adults who were intubated using a laryngoscope. Most people were undergoing surgery and the intubation was planned or expected, but some intubations happened in emergency situations. Most studies included a mix of people. Some studies were in selected groups, such as people who were obese or when medical staff expected that intubation may be difficult. The studies were conducted in countries from around the world. Manufacturers of laryngoscopes were involved in 14 of the studies.  
Main results 
Compared to the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope, all three types of videolaryngoscope probably reduce the number of failed intubations. Hyperangulated videolaryngoscopes may lead to fewer failed intubations particularly in people with an airway that is difficult to intubate (or an expected difficult airway). All videolaryngoscopes may also increase the chances of being successfully intubated on the first attempt and improve the view of the vocal cords.  
Macintosh‐style and channelled videolaryngoscopes probably reduce the risk of the person experiencing a low oxygen level, but there may be little or no difference when a hyperangulated videolaryngoscope is used. Using a hyperangulated videolaryngoscope may reduce the risk of the breathing tube being accidentally inserted into the food pipe instead of the windpipe. The other videolaryngoscopes may or may not reduce this risk. 
No type of laryngoscope increased or reduced accidental damage to the teeth, but we are very uncertain about this finding. We were unable to tell if any of the laryngoscopes reduced the time taken for intubation.
