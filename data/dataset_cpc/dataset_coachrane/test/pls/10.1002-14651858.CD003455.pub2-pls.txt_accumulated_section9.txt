Non‐surgical interventions for late rectal consequences of radiotherapy in people who have received radical radiotherapy to the pelvis 
Background 
Radiotherapy is often used to treat cancer in the pelvic area. Several organs in the pelvis, such as the anus, rectum, bladder, prostate, gynaecological organs (womb, ovaries, cervix, and vagina), small bowel, and pelvic bones may be exposed to the effects of radiotherapy, which can lead to pelvic radiation disease. Symptoms from pelvic radiation disease may occur around the time of treatment (early effects) or over a period of time, often many years after treatment (late effects) due to long‐term changes secondary to scarring (fibrosis), narrowing (stenosis), and bleeding due to new blood vessel formation (telangiectasia). Damage to the rectum (radiation proctopathy) is the most often investigated late radiation effect to the pelvis, which affects a small but but still important group of people who undergo pelvic radiotherapy. The common symptoms are rectal urgency, rectal incontinence, pain, mucus discharge, and rectal bleeding. 
The aim of the review 
The aim of this review was to assess the effect of non‐surgical treatments on late rectal damage. 
Main Findings 
We found 16 (quasi) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 993 participants that assessed non‐surgical treatments for radiation proctopathy. Although some treatments look promising (including rectal sucralfate, adding metronidazole to an anti‐inflammatory regimen, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), the quality of evidence was low to very low. Furthermore, outcomes important to people with cancer, including quality of life (QoL), and long‐term effects were often not addressed in these studies. 
Conclusions 
Although some interventions for late radiation rectal damage are promising, the evidence was of low quality and we can draw no firm conclusions. We could not combine data from the studies to compare different treatments, since the trial designs and outcome measures differed. The episodic and variable nature of late radiation rectal damage requires larger RCTs to establish whether treatments are effective. Future studies should address the possibility of associated injury to other pelvic structures, collectively known as pelvic radiation disease. Ideally outcome measures should be standardised across studies and include QoL evaluations and other outcomes important to people with cancer .
