Drug treatments for chronic cognitive impairment in traumatic brain injury
Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of long‐term disability across the world. The disability is often related to chronic cognitive impairment, such as changes to memory, attention and problem solving. 
Method: We reviewed randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of any of the drugs commonly used to treat cognitive impairment after TBI. We included only studies which started treatment at least 12 months after the injury; by this time the cognitive impairment is usually stable. 
Results: We identified only four trials for inclusion. These investigated four different drugs—modafinil; the experimental drug (−)‐OSU6162; atomoxetine; and rivastigmine—against placebo. On most measures there was no difference between treatment and placebo. Furthermore, the quality of the evidence was assessed as very low. 
The experimental drug called (−)‐OSU6162 was better than placebo on three cognitive measures, although this was a small study with only six participants with TBI. Modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine were not found to be better than placebo. No difference between modafinil and placebo was found on assessment of clinical global improvement. Compared to placebo, more participants on modafinil and fewer on rivastigmine dropped out of the trials. More people taking modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine experienced adverse effects than those on placebo, although the difference is most likely due to chance. Only nausea was statistically more likely in those taking rivastigmine. In the study of (−)‐OSU6162, one participant of three given placebo experienced adverse effects requiring a dose reduction, with no drop‐outs reported. No studies reported any deaths.
