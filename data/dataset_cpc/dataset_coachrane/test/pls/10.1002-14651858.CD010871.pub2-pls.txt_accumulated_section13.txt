Antibiotics for treating genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non‐pregnant women 
Review question 
This systematic review assessed the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) genital infection in terms of microbiological or clinical failure in men and non‐pregnant women. 
Background 
CT is the most frequent cause of urinary tract and genital infections in women and men. However, women frequently show no symptoms when they are infected. CT infection can lead to complications or cause further problems in reproductive health in women (infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain), and men (prostatitis (swollen prostate gland), or chronic pelvic pain. Clinical guidelines for treating CT do not recommend a preferred antibiotic treatment. This Cochrane review evaluates all randomised controlled studies (where participants are assigned at random to one of the treatments), that included antibiotics for the treatment of genital CT infection that are recommended by the most up‐to‐date clinical guidelines. 
Search date 
We searched for studies published up to June 2018 that provided information about failure to eliminate the CT infection or improve the symptoms, presence of adverse events, antimicrobial resistance, and reinfection. as treatment outcomes 
Study characteristics 
We selected 14 studies with a total of 2715 men and non‐pregnant women with CT infection, who had been treated with any antibiotic recommended by clinical guidelines (2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). Women showed no symptoms or had uterine cervicitis, and men had non‐gonococcal urethritis (an inflammation of the urethra not caused by gonorrhoeal infection). All of the participants had a positive test for CT. The studies lasted from 7 to 84 days after the end of treatment, with an average of 28 days. Most of the studies took place in sexually transmitted disease clinics in the USA. Studies compared the antibiotics doxycycline with azithromycin, and doxycycline with ofloxacin. 
Study funding sources 
One study reported funding from academic grants, another four studies declared having received sponsorship or grants from pharmaceutical companies. The other studies declared that they were self‐funded or did not mention funding at all. 
Key results (statistics) 
We developed meta‐analysis (a way of combining the results of studies), for two comparisons: azithromycin 1 g single dose versus doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for seven days, and doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for seven days versus ofloxacin 300 mg to 400 mg once daily or twice daily for seven days.
