Medication for posttraumatic stress disorder
Why is this review important? 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after exposure to significant trauma and results in enormous personal and societal costs. Although it has traditionally been treated with psychotherapy, medication treatments have proven effective in PTSD treatment. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
‐ People with PTSD.‐ Families and friends of people who suffer from PTSD.‐ General practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pharmacists. 
What question does this review aim to answer? 
‐ Is pharmacotherapy effective for reducing PTSD symptoms in adults with PTSD?  
Which studies were included in the review? 
We included studies comparing medication with placebo or a control, or both, for the treatment of PTSD in adults.We included 66 trials in the review, with a total of 7442 participants. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There was evidence of a beneficial effect that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) improve PTSD symptoms compared to placebo, based on moderate‐certainty evidence. There was also evidence of a benefit for the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine and the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline, in improving PTSD symptoms, based on low‐certainty evidence. We also found no evidence of benefit for the number of participants who improved following treatment with the antipsychotic group compared to placebo, based on very low‐certainty evidence. For the remaining medication classes, we did not observe evidence of a benefit for improving PTSD symptoms. 
There was evidence of a harm that more people taking individual SSRI agents dropped out due to side effects than did those taking placebo, but absolute withdrawal rates were low for the SSRI groups. 
What should happen next? 
Most evidence for pharmacotherapy efficacy is related to SSRIs for acute treatment. There is an ongoing need to develop new pharmacotherapeutic treatments of PTSD.
