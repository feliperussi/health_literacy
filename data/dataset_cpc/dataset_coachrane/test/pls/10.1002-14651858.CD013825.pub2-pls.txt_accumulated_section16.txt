Are laboratory‐made, COVID‐19‐specific monoclonal antibodies an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
‐ We do not know whether antibodies (the body’s natural defence against disease) made in a laboratory and all the same as one another (monoclonal) and designed to target COVID‐19, are an effective treatment for COVID‐19 because we assessed only six studies exploring different treatments in different types of patients. 
‐ We identified 36 ongoing studies that will provide more evidence when completed.
‐ We will update this review regularly as more evidence becomes available.
What are ‘monoclonal’ antibodies? 
Antibodies are made by the body as a defence against disease. However, they can also be produced in a laboratory from cells taken from people who have recovered from a disease.  
Antibodies that are designed to target only one specific protein – in this case, a protein on the virus that causes COVID‐19 – are ‘monoclonal’. They attach to the COVID‐19 virus and stop it from entering and replicating in human cells, which helps to fight the infection. Monoclonal antibodies have been used successfully to treat other viruses. They are thought to cause fewer unwanted effects than convalescent plasma, which contains a variety of different antibodies. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if COVID‐19 specific monoclonal antibodies are an effective treatment for COVID‐19. We looked at whether they:  
‐ reduced the number of deaths from any cause; 
‐ improved symptoms or made them worse; 
‐ increased admissions to hospital; and
‐ caused any serious or other unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated one or more monoclonal antibodies to treat people with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with placebo (sham treatment), another treatment or no treatment. Studies could take place anywhere globally and include participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19.
