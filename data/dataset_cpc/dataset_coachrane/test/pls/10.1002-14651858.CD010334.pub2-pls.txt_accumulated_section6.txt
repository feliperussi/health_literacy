Treatments for unwanted male pattern hair growth in women
Background  Up to 5% to 10% of women are hirsute (hair in areas where normally only men have hairs such as moustache, beard area, chest, belly, back etc). The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome. Hirsutism can lead to psychological distress, low self esteem, decreased self image, depression, feelings of shame and social difficulties. 
Review question  Which treatments (except laser and light‐based therapies alone) work best for hirsutism? 
Study characteristics  We included 157 studies published up to June 2014, which examined 10,550 people. Participants included women with a mean age of 25 years. There was considerable variation in the quality of how the studies were conducted; more than half were not blinded and this may have had an impact on the reporting of the outcomes. Most studies were carried out in single centres in Europe and lasted six to 12 months. A range of treatments were evaluated, mostly in single studies. These included a few topical treatments, lifestyle modification, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), medication to inhibit the effect of hormones that are responsible for male traits, and combination therapies. Participant‐assessed improvement and impact on quality of life were evaluated in a minority of the studies, whilst the majority of the studies measured physician‐assessed reduction in hirsutism, as well as androgen levels in the blood. Half of the studies reported adverse events and around one‐third other signs and symptoms, e.g. oily skin and menstrual irregularities that might be due to an increase of androgen levels in the blood. 
Key results  Oral contraceptive pills reduced the amount of hairs, but the reduction was not consistent across the studies, although two OCPs (ethinyl estradiol 35 µg + cyproterone acetate 2 mg compared to ethinyl estradiol 30 µg + desogestrel 0.15 mg) appeared to be effective in a way that can be considered important for women with hirsutism. 
Of the antiandrogen drugs, flutamide was considered to be more effective than placebo by both the women and the doctors. Spironolactone was also effective, but data were only available for the physicians' assessments. Finasteride did not show convincing effectiveness based on the evaluations of the hirsute women and those made by the investigators. The addition of cyproterone acetate (an antiandrogen) to OCP seemed to enhance the beneficial effect of OCPs on hair reduction.
