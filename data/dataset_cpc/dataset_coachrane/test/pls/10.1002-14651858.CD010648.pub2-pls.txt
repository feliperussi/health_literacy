Adjusted doses of oral misoprostol for treating slow progress in labour
Abnormally slow progress in labour (labour dystocia) may lead to serious complications including death for women and their babies. Drugs to increase the frequency and strength of contractions have often been used in such births. Misoprostol is an inexpensive and stable drug that stimulates uterine contractions, but it can have serious and even life‐threatening side‐effects and so the dose has to be carefully adjusted. Titration refers to the process of adjusting the dosing of a medication on the basis of frequent monitoring to achieve the best outcomes. Titrated misoprostol could be effective in treating delayed progress in labour and as an alternative to oxytocin which is harder to store and is given intravenously by infusion. 
We identified two randomised controlled trials with 581 women requiring augmentation, each looking at different doses of oral misoprostol compared with oxytocin. One study gave 20 mcg doses of misoprostol every hour up to four hours, after which the dose was increased; the second gave women 75 mcg doses, repeated after four hours provided there were no adverse effects observed. Neither trial reported on the important safety outcomes of maternal or neonatal deaths, or severe maternal ill health. 
One trial measured duration of labour from the start of augmentation, which was slightly shorter with intravenous oxytocin (5.20 hours compared with 5.22 hours). The number of vaginal deliveries within 12 and 24 hours, and caesarean section rates were similar. Neither trial reported clearly higher rates of uterine hyperstimulation with worrying fetal heart rate changes in the titrated oral misoprostol group. The rates of this outcome in the two studies varied greatly however. The evidence on uterine hyperstimulation without fetal heart rate changes was not consistent. 
The number of women reporting nausea, vomiting, shivering and pyrexia was low with both misoprostol and oxytocin. Maternal satisfaction was not reported in either trial. 
Important uncertainties still exist on the safety and acceptability of titrated oral misoprostol for labour dystocia, and further research is needed before it can be recommended as an alternative to oxytocin. However, in facilities that do not have access to electronic oxytocin infusion, lower doses of titrated misoprostol may be a better alternative to avoid hyperstimulation.
