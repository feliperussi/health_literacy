Opioids for agitation in dementia
Opioids (such as morphine and codeine) are strong painkillers best known as treatments for post‐surgical and cancer pain. They are also used for long‐term painful conditions other than cancer and sometimes for symptoms other than pain. They have a number of important adverse effects and their use involves a balance of risks and benefits. 
Agitation is a common experience for people living with dementia. Usual treatment initially focuses on identifying and remedying underlying causes and meeting unmet needs. If agitation persists, then drug treatments are often used. However, the current drug treatments for relieving agitation have limited effectiveness and are associated with safety concerns. 
Pain may be one cause of agitation in dementia. Many people with dementia (particularly older people) will also have chronic, painful conditions. Pain may be experienced differently due to the dementia and may often go uncommunicated or untreated. It can be hard to know whether agitation is due to pain. Opioids may be useful in the treatment of agitation where pain is an underlying factor, but may also be effective for relieving distress in the absence of physical pain. 
We searched for randomised, placebo controlled trials in which people with any form of dementia and associated agitation were treated with opioid drugs. We found no completed trials to include in our review, although there are two potentially relevant trials still in progress. 
We therefore concluded that there is no high quality evidence to determine whether opioids are a safe or effective treatment for agitation in dementia.
