Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins
Background 
Varicose veins are enlarged, visibly lumpy knotted veins, usually found in the legs. They can cause pain, burning discomfort, aching, and itching as well as generalised aching, heaviness or swelling in the legs. However, some people do not attribute all symptoms to varicose veins, as there is little correlation between these symptoms and the extent or size of the varicose veins. Varicose vein disease can affect quality of life as it is cosmetically unattractive, can cause phlebitis, bleeding, skin pigmentation, and ulcers. 
Injection sclerotherapy can be used to treat varicose veins. Sclerotherapy is achieved by injection of an irritating liquid or foam into the blood vessels, leading to transformation of varicose veins into a fibrous cord. Possible complications include the formation of blood clots, skin pigmentation, inflammation, ulceration with tissue damage, and reactions to the sclerosing agent. 
This review aimed to investigate how effective and safe sclerotherapy is by comparing it to no treatment or placebo (sham) treatment; comparing different ways to perform sclerotherapy (including different doses, liquid versus foam, injection techniques, different substances) or comparing sclerotherapy to compression. 
Study characteristics and key findings 
We searched for relevant studies and identified 28 randomised controlled trials, involving over 4278 participants (search current to 20 July 2021). We looked at cosmetic appearance, complications, residual varicose vein rates, quality of life, and symptomatic improvement related to sclerotherapy. There were no trials assessing treatment versus no interventions, sclerotherapy at different time intervals, or sclerotherapy compared with pharmacological therapy. 
Our results showed that, compared to placebo, sclerotherapy may improve cosmetic appearance and quality of life, and may reduce residual varicose veins and persistence of symptoms but the evidence is uncertain. Rates of deep vein thrombosis may be slightly increased but the evidence is uncertain. There were no data for recurrent varicose veins. There was not enough Information to conclude if one concentration of foam was better than another, or if foam was better than liquid or any other substance; or if there was any benefit of one injection technique compared to another.
