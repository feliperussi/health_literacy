Enteral zinc supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates 
Review question: do preterm infants (babies born early) die less often and develop and grow better when they receive extra zinc by way of the stomach? 
Background: zinc is an important trace element required by babies to grow well and to fight infections. When babies are born early, they miss out on the transfer of many important nutrients from the mother through the umbilical cord which would normally happen in the last weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, their zinc stores are low. Adding extra zinc to the milk of preterm babies might mean that they grow and develop better and get less sick from complications which often affect babies born too early, and therefore die less often. 
Study characteristics: we included five small trials (482 preterm infants) which were all of reasonably strong design. There was one ongoing study. The search for trials is up‐to‐date as of 20 February 2020. 
Key results: preterm babies who received extra zinc by way of the stomach (a maximum of 10 mg per day either by mouth or through a feeding tube) while they were still in hospital probably die less often, probably put on weight and grew slightly better in length than those preterm babies who did not receive extra zinc. Extra zinc probably makes little to no difference to common problems in preterm babies such as chronic lung or eye problems, infection with bacteria or bowel problems. The trials which we included in this review did not have any information on the effect of extra zinc on the development later in life of the babies such as their ability to walk, their hearing or vision, language or their intelligence. We did not find indications of adverse effects of the extra zinc given to the babies. New and larger trials are needed to learn more about the effect on long‐term development and growth when zinc is given by way of the stomach to babies born early. 
Certainty of evidence: we assessed the evidence from the included trials on the effects of extra zinc in preterm babies as being of 'low‐ to moderate‐certainty', because the trials were small, some had a few methodological weaknesses and the reported findings were inconsistent with each other for some of the outcomes. This means that further research through larger trials will likely provide important contributions to the existing knowledge and increase our confidence in the results.
