Are medicines that delay the start of labour (tocolytics) effective for delaying preterm birth? 
Key messages 
• All tocolytics (medicines that delay labour) that we assessed (betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate, oxytocin receptor antagonists, nitric oxide donors) and their combinations were probably or possibly effective in delaying preterm birth for 48 hours and for 7 days compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no tocolytic treatment, 
• Tocolytics cause a wide range of unwanted effects (from minor to potentially severe) compared with placebo or no tocolytic treatment. Women taking betamimetics and combinations of tocolytics were more likely to stop taking them as a result of unwanted effects. 
• The effects of tocolytics on deaths of babies before and after birth, and on infection in mothers and babies were uncertain. 
What is the issue? 
Preterm birth is the most common reason why a newborn baby may die, and is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Preterm birth (previously called premature birth) is defined as birth of a baby before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. The earlier the baby is born, the poorer the outcome. Preterm infants are not only at increased risk of death, but also serious illness. They are more likely to face breathing complications, difficulties with feeding and body temperature regulation. Long‐term complications include disability associated with brain function, and lung and gut complications. 
Why is this important? 
Tocolytics aim to delay preterm birth and allow time for women to receive medicines that can help with baby's breathing and feeding if born preterm, and medicines that lower the chance of the infant having cerebral palsy. Crucially, a short delay in preterm birth can enable women to reach specialist care. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which tocolytic is most effective in delaying preterm birth, and has the fewest unwanted effects. We collected and analysed all studies to answer this question (date of search: 21 April 2021) 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence and identified 122 studies of 13,697 women involving six classes of tocolytics (betamimetics, COX inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate, oxytocin receptor antagonists, and nitric oxide donors), combinations of tocolytics, and placebo or no tocolytic treatment. Of 122 studies, we judged 25 (20%) to provide the most trustworthy evidence. Overall, the evidence varied widely in quality, and our confidence in our results ranged from very low to high. We compared the different tocolytics against each other as well as against placebo or no treatment.
