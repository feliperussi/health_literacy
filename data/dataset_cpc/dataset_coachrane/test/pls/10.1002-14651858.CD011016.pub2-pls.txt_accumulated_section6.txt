Omega‐3 and omega‐6 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements for dry eye disease
What is the aim of this review? Dry eye is a long‐term eye condition that can lead to eye discomfort and changes to vision. Omega‐3 and omega‐6 supplements, including the omega‐3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been studied as a treatment for dry eye. This Cochrane Review summarizes the best available research evidence. 
Key messages More research is needed to gain a full understanding of the role of omega‐3 and omega‐6 supplements in treating dry eye disease, particularly with how to use this therapy to treat dry eye due to different causes and severities. There is also a need for more research to provide information about how the supplement characteristics (eg, dose, form, composition) affect clinical outcomes. 
What was studied in the review? The main outcome was improvement in dry eye symptoms, measured after at least one month of follow‐up. Secondary outcomes considered a range of clinical measures and side effects. 
What are the main results of the review? We included 34 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving more than 4314 adult participants from 13 countries. 
Although much of the evidence was uncertain, long‐chain omega‐3 supplements may have little to no benefit, relative to placebo, on dry eye symptoms, but did improve some clinical signs. There was a beneficial effect on dry eye symptoms when omega‐3 supplements were combined with standard dry eye treatments (eg, artificial tears, eyelid warm compresses, corticosteroid eye drops) compared to standard treatment alone, and when long‐chain omega‐3 supplements were compared with omega‐6 supplements. The most common side effect was temporary gastrointestinal problems.
