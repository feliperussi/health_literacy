Surgical interventions for symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis
Review question 
Is surgical intervention safe and beneficial in the management of patients with symptomatic mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee? 
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the knee affects millions of people worldwide. End‐stage osteoarthritis of the knee is successfully treated with a knee replacement. Participants with mild to moderate degenerative changes in the knee can be very symptomatic but are not routinely offered knee replacement surgery as they do less well following this procedure. It is not known whether other types of surgery in this group are beneficial and safe.

Study characteristics 
All included studies were randomised controlled trials involving adults (18 years of age and older) with symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. One study, including 320 participants from the USA compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) and physical therapy (home‐based exercises) to physical therapy (PT) alone. One study, including 32 participants from the USA, compared arthroscopic surgery (debridement ± synovectomy ± chondroplasty) to closed needle joint lavage with saline. Two studies, including 152 participants (120 from Pakistan, 32 from the UK) compared arthroscopic surgery (washout ± debridement, debridement) to a hyaluronic acid injection. One study, including 62 participants from the Netherlands, compared high tibial osteotomy surgery to knee joint distraction surgery. 
Funding sources 
One study was supported by grant 9040 from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, by the NIH (NIAMS) and by the Percy Surgical Research Trust of Lutheran General Hospital. One study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. One study was funded by ZonMw (The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development). Two studies did not report any funding source. 
Key results 
Due to space constraints, reporting of results is restricted to the primary comparison, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery versus a six‐week progressive home‐based exercise intervention for the knee, at 12 months:
