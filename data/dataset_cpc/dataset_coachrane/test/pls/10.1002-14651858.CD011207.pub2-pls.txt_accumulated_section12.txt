Can community pharmacy interventions help improve pharmacy workers' skills and pharmacy users' health outcomes through health promotion? 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to find out whether interventions that support people to change health behaviours, and are delivered in community pharmacies, can change the way that pharmacy workers interact with pharmacy users and can improve health outcomes for those users. 
Key messages 
Community pharmacies and their workers may have an important part to play in health promotion, and probably improve the health outcomes of pharmacy users slightly, at an acceptable cost and with no evidence of harm (adverse events may or may not have occurred, this is unclear as no adverse effects were reported by the studies). 
What was studied in the review? 
Community pharmacies are an easy place for many people to access healthcare advice. In the past this advice was limited to how best to take medicines, but, increasingly, community pharmacy workers are carrying out other activities, such as giving advice on healthy eating and management of long‐term conditions. While some community pharmacy workers may offer the sale of products without a strong evidence‐base, the professional guidance issued to pharmacists has attempted to reduce these transactions, and has placed more emphasis on developing evidence‐based public health services. Many people find health‐related lifestyle and self‐management behaviours difficult. Pharmacies may be convenient for people to use, but it is important to understand whether health‐promoting activities delivered in pharmacies are worthwhile and effective, so that those responsible for commissioning health care can decide whether it is worth spending resources to support them. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We identified 57 studies with a total of 16,220 participants that investigated the effects of health‐promotion activities compared to normal treatment or no treatment. These were conducted across the world, 49 of them in high‐income countries and eight in middle‐income countries. Most studies (36/57) targeted both pharmacy workers and pharmacy users; eight were directed at pharmacy workers only, and 13 at pharmacy users only. The health areas most frequently studied were diabetes, hypertension, asthma and reduction of cardiovascular risk. The studies varied in quality. Some studies did not take enough precautions to stop the participants who should have received either no treatment or usual treatment (i.e. the control group) receiving parts of the intervention. 
We found that pharmacy workers may be able to change their behaviour, for example improve their communication skills, to help people to manage their health conditions more effectively. 
Overall these studies probably show a slight beneficial effect on pharmacy users' health‐related behaviour, intermediate clinical outcomes (e.g. levels of cholesterol or glycated haemoglobin) and quality of life. No studies reported measuring pharmacy users' clinical events such as heart attacks or stroke. There was also no evidence of harm reported in any of the studies, but no studies reported measuring adverse events. Five out of seven studies that measured costs showed that health promotion delivered by pharmacy workers was cost effective. 
These findings suggest that community pharmacy workers can probably slightly improve pharmacy users' health outcomes at a reasonable cost. The variety of studies includes different countries, conditions, interventions and outcomes, and suggests there is great interest in using the community pharmacy setting for workers to promote health‐related behaviours. However, in order to make future studies easier to compare, there is a need for greater use of thorough, systematic approaches in the description of these interventions, use of a standardised set of outcomes, and for new studies to build on prior work.
