What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for skin disease in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease that affects the whole body) 
Why is this question important? 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; also known as ‘lupus’) is a disease in which the body's immune (defence) system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. It affects 7.5 million people worldwide. Around 70% of affected people develop skin problems such as rash on the nose or cheeks. Often, SLE also causes pain in joints and muscles and extreme tiredness. Symptoms can improve temporarily, or they can worsen suddenly (flares). In severe cases, SLE can cause life‐threatening damage to the heart, lungs, brain, or kidneys. 
There is no cure for SLE. However, there are treatments designed to improve symptoms. In particular, there are a range of options for treating skin problems. 
• Medicines that can be taken by mouth (orally), applied as creams, or given as injections.
• Therapies to help people cope with their skin problems, such as talking therapies.
• Other approaches, including herbal medicine, light therapy, or make‐up.
To find out which treatments work best for people with SLE, and to compare adverse (unwanted) effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched the medical literature for studies that compared any treatment for skin disease in SLE against: 
• a placebo (dummy) treatment;
• no treatment;
• another treatment; or
• a different dose of the same treatment.
We compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes and the consistency of findings across studies.
