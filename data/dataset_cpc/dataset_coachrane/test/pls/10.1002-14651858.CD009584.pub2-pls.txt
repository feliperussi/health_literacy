Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) affects around 10% of children under five years of age in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Different food strategies have been used for the nutritional recovery of children with MAM, such as lipid‐based nutrient supplements or blended foods, which can be provided in full dose or in a low dose as a complement to the usual diet. However, there is no definitive consensus on the most effective way to treat children with MAM. 
We searched eight electronic databases and three trials registers (in October 2012 for all except Embase, which was searched in August 2012). We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted nutrition‐related organisations and researchers in this field. 
We found eight relevant randomised controlled trials, enrolling 10,037 children under five years of age. All but one study was conducted in Africa. 
The risk of bias in the studies was generally low, though two studies had a high dropout rate. The participants were aware which intervention group they were in and this may have influenced their behaviour but we thought it unlikely it would have influenced the results since the outcomes measured were objective ones. For four of the studies, we were unable to assess if the study authors reported all the outcomes they intended to measure. 
When any type of specially formulated food was compared to standard care (medical care and counselling without foods), the children treated with foods had a higher chance of recovering from moderate malnutrition (two studies), greater improvement in nutritional status (two studies), and a lower number of dropouts (one study). A reduction in mortality was not shown. 
When lipid‐based nutrient supplements (which are food with high energy density and high lipid content) at full dose were compared to blended foods at full dose (which are dry food mixtures without high lipid content), there was no difference between these two types of foods in terms of number of deaths (five studies), children progressing to severe acute malnutrition (three studies), and children dropping out (four studies). However, lipid‐based nutrient supplements increased the number recovered by 10% (five studies), decreased the number of children non‐recovering (three studies), and slightly improved the nutritional status among the recovered. One study observed more children vomiting when given lipid‐based nutrient supplements compared to blended foods, but this was not reported by the other studies. No other side effects were reported. 
Few studies evaluated foods at complementary dosage (i.e. foods given in low quantity, just to complement the diet and not to fully substitute it), and no conclusion could be drawn from these studies. 
When specific foods were compared to each other, a type of corn‐soy blended food called CSB++ compared to lipid‐based nutrient supplements resulted in similar outcomes, while results of another blended food (CSB pre‐mix) versus lipid‐based nutrient supplements were unclear. In one study, CSB++ did not show any significant benefit over locally‐made blended foods, for example, Misola. 
No study evaluated the impact of improving adequacy of local diet, such as local foods prepared at home according to a given recipe or of home processing of local foods (soaking, germination, malting, fermentation) in order to increase their nutritional content. 
In conclusion, there is moderate to high quality evidence that both lipid‐based nutrient supplements and blended foods are effective in treating children with moderate acute malnutrition. Although lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) led to a clinically significant benefit in the number of children recovered in comparison with blended foods, LNS did not reduce mortality, the risk of default or progression to SAM. It also induced more vomiting. Blended foods such as CSB++ may be equally effective and cheaper than LNS. There are no studies evaluating special recipes to improve the adequacy of the usual home diet, an approach that should be evaluated in settings where food is available, and nutritional education and habits are the main determinants of malnutrition. There are no studies from Asia, where moderate acute malnutrition is most prevalent.
