Heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in acutely ill medical patients (excluding those with stroke or myocardial infarction) 
Blood clots may form in the veins of patients who are admitted to hospital suffering from an acute medical illness. These types of blood clots are referred to as deep vein thromboses (DVT) and they may break free from the blood vessel wall and travel to the lungs and cause death, at which point they are referred to as a pulmonary embolism (PE). These types of blood clots and their prevention have been thoroughly studied in surgical patients but not as much in non‐surgical, medical patients, who make up a greater proportion of hospital patients. Medical patients differ from surgical patients with regard to their health, the progression of clots and the impact that preventative measures can have. The extensive experience from clot prevention studies in surgical patients is therefore not necessarily applicable to non‐surgical patients. 
Heparin is a blood thinning drug, which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of blood clots in patients after they have had surgery. Heparin exists in two forms, the original unfractionated (UFH) form and a newer form called low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The aim of the current review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of heparin (UFH or LMWH) to prevent DVTs and PEs in non‐surgical, medical patients admitted to hospital, excluding those admitted to hospital with a heart attack or stroke or those requiring admission to an intensive care unit. The outcomes investigated in this review were DVT, PE that did not cause death, PE that resulted in death, combined non‐fatal and fatal PE, all‐cause death, bleeding complications and thrombocytopaenia, which is a condition that can be caused by heparin and results in decreased platelets in the blood. 
This review of 16 trials in 34,369 non‐surgical patients who suffered an acute medical illness found that heparin reduced the number of patients suffering DVTs but also increased the risk of bleeding complications when compared to participants that received a placebo or no medication. We had some concerns over how reliable the results were from the unblinded studies, which made up just under half of the studies. Also, most of the studies were lacking explanations of how the allocation of the treatments was performed. The lower risk of PEs (when combining those that caused death and those that did not) with heparin could have been a chance effect. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rate of death or thrombocytopaenia. The review also found that patients who were given LMWH developed fewer DVTs and fewer bleeding complications compared with those given UFH, leading to the conclusion that LMWH is more effective and carries a lower risk of adverse events in preventing blood clots than with UFH. There was no clear evidence of differences between LMWH and UFH for PE, death or thrombocytopaenia.
