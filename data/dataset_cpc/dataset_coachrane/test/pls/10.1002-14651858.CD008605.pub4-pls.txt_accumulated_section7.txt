Can dopamine agonists prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing fertility treatment with IVF or ICSI? 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether dopamine agonists are effective and safe for preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women at high risk of OHSS (e.g. women with polycystic ovaries or a high number of eggsÂ following ovarian stimulation) undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). How effective are these medicines compared to other types of medicines or withholding ovarian stimulation for a few days (called coasting))? 
Background 
IVF (eggs and sperm are mixed in a laboratory and the resulting embryo inserted into the womb) or ICSI (an IVF procedure where a single sperm cell is injected directly into an egg in a laboratory and the resulting embryo inserted into the womb) are treatments for infertility. To do these, the ovaries (female reproductive organs) are stimulated to produce more eggs by giving women a hormone medication. OHSS is a complication of the stimulation of the ovaries in IVF or ICSI treatment where too many eggs develop, the ovaries swell up, and fluid leaks into other parts of the body, resulting in bloating of the stomach, blood clots, and a reduction in blood and oxygen to important organs. In most cases, the condition is mild and resolves without treatment, but some women develop a moderate or severe form of OHSS that requires hospitalisation. There is no cure for OHSS other than waiting for it to settle down and managing the symptoms until they disappear. 
Dopamine agonists are a medicine that could prevent the leaking of fluid from the blood vessels to other parts of the body, which is a major problem in OHSS. 
Several treatments have been suggested to prevent OHSS. For example, coasting, or medications that keep fluid in the blood vessels (dopamine agonists, human albumin, hydroxyethyl starch, calcium, or diosmin) or support organ function (prednisolone).
