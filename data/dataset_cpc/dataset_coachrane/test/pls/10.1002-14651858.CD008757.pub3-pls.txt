Information provision to help people with multiple sclerosis make informed decisions
Background 
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with many uncertainties in all phases of the disease. For example, the significance of a diagnosis for the future disease course remains unclear, as up to one‐third of people will experience a benign disease course with little or even no disability progression. Uncertainty is also present for the effects and adverse effects of drug and non‐drug therapies. 
People with MS have the right and wish to receive accurate, recent, and relevant information in order to make informed choices on all relevant disease‐related decisions and also on personal life‐planning decisions. For this to occur, balanced information is a prerequisite. It has been shown that disease knowledge is poor in people with MS, therefore people with MS should receive interventions that provide information on all aspects relevant for them. 
Results 
We searched for relevant studies in the medical literature in November 2017 and identified 11 studies involving a total of 1387 participants. The studies evaluated a variety of approaches including the provision of written information or decision aids, coaching, educational programmes, and personal information. The quality of the study methods varied. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. Five studies assessing level of knowledge showed that information may successfully increase patients’ knowledge (moderate‐certainty evidence). Five studies reporting on the effects on decision making (low‐certainty evidence) and six studies assessing quality of life (low‐certainty evidence) showed mixed results. As the studies and the interventions used differed markedly, and the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes was not high, our results prevented a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS.
