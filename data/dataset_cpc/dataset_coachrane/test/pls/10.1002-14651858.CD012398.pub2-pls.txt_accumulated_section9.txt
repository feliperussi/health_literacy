Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others 
Review question 
Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. 
Searching for evidence 
On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. 
Evidence found 
We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies.
