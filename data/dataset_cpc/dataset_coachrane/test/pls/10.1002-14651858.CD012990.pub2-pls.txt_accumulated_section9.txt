Can exenatide, a diabetes drug, be used to treat Parkinson's disease?
Review question 
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of GLP‐1 receptor agonists for Parkinson's disease. 
Background 
People with Parkinson's disease (PD) have problems with movement, such as slow movement and shaking at rest. They may also have other problems such as depression, difficulty swallowing, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists are used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. They work by stimulating GLP‐1 receptors in the pancreas, which causes the release of insulin. GLP‐1 receptors have also been found in the brain. Neurones in the brain send signals to and from the brain and the rest of the body. Insulin signalling in the brain is important for keeping neurones healthy, but it has been shown that insulin signalling does not work well in the brain of people with PD. Researchers are interested in finding out about the protective effects of GLP‐1 receptor agonists on neurones, and how these agonists might help people with disease affecting the brain, such as PD. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that provided data for a total of 104 patients (following dropout of three patients). One study compared exenatide (a GLP‐1 receptor agonist) versus placebo (a pretend medicine), and the other study compared exenatide versus no treatment (other than the usual treatment that people received). Evidence is current to June 2020. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that people who took exenatide had better improvement in motor symptoms than people who took placebo. Movement was measured 12 weeks after patients had stopped taking exenatide. We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that for people taking exenatide, there may be little or no difference in health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Six serious adverse events (SAEs) were seen in people taking exenatide and two in people taking placebo, but all were considered by the study authors to be not related to the drug.
