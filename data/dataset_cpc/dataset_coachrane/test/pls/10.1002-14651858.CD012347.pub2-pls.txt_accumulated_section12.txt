Are psychological therapies effective in treating depression in patients with COPD?
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comprises two conditions: emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It has been recognised as a serious health problem and one of the main causes of death around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) informs that the number of people with COPD continues to grow, and by 2030, COPD will become the world's third cause of death. Most of the people who have COPD also experience depression. Studies show that up to 80% of patients with more severe COPD can have symptoms of depression. Other findings show that patients with COPD are four times more likely to have depression than those without COPD. 
Why is this review important? 
The number of people living with COPD is increasing, rather than decreasing, around the world. Depression in this population is commonly unrecognised, and patients rarely receive appropriate treatment. Untreated depression increases the risk of death, hospitalisation, readmissions, and healthcare costs. Currently, there is no strong evidence showing which psychological therapy is most effective for patients with COPD and depression. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
People who have COPD and depression, respiratory physicians, mental health specialists, respiratory nurses, other healthcare professionals, and policy makers. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
Which psychological therapy (if any) is effective in reducing symptoms of depression in patients with COPD? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
This review included experimental studies, called randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with participants who had diagnosed COPD. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
This review included 13 experimental studies (RCTs) with 1500 participants. Our main result shows that psychological therapies using cognitive‚Äêbehavioural therapy (CBT) approach may, potentially, be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with COPD. However, the quality of this evidence is very low because of many limitations related to the way the studies were conducted.
