Do vaginal packing, tranexamic acid, interventional radiology or other interventions control vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer? 
Background: cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb) is the fourth most common cancer among women throughout the world, accounting for about 569,847 new detected cases and 311,365 deaths every year. Women more commonly present with advanced disease in the developing (low‐income) world, where access to cervical screening programmes is limited. Advanced cancer of the cervix may not be curable and women often need treatment to control distressing symptoms (palliation), such as vaginal bleeding. Bleeding can be severe enough to be life threatening in women with advanced cervical cancer. Management of vaginal bleeding often poses a challenge, especially in the developing world, where access to radiotherapy is limited. Options for palliative treatment of severe vaginal bleeding include interventional radiology treatment (using x‐rays to guide the insertion of 'plugs' into blood vessels supplying the cancer) or vaginal packing (where gauze is compacted into the vagina to absorb the blood and apply pressure directly to the cervix), although these are often only partly effective and may cause harm. Vaginal packs can be soaked with formalin, which is a preservative chemical. Other options for treating severe vaginal bleeding include tranexamic acid (a medicine that reduces bleeding that can be given by mouth or by injection) and radiotherapy (high‐energy x‐ray treatment). 
Review question: the aim of this review was to compare tranexamic acid, vaginal packing (with or without formalin‐soaked packs), interventional radiology or other interventions versus radiotherapy treatment to control vaginal bleeding in cervical cancer.
