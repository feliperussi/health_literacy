Alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists to prevent shivering after general anaesthesia
Background 
Shivering after general anaesthesia is common. As well as being unpleasant for the patient, it can increase pain and affect oxygen levels. Alpha‐2 (α‐2) adrenergic agonists are a group of drugs that have been tested for the purpose of preventing or treating shivering. We aimed with this review to consider whether α‐2 agonists can be administered to reduce shivering after surgery without causing serious side effects. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current up to 13 June 2014. We found 20 relevant randomized controlled trials with 1401 participants undergoing surgical procedures with general anaesthesia. These studies compared an α‐2 agonist (either clonidine or dexmedetomidine) with a control. The doses, methods, and time that the drugs were given varied between studies. 
Key results 
All studies reported results for shivering. Our analysis showed that α‐2 agonists significantly reduce the risk of postoperative shivering when administered before or during surgery. However, our analysis also showed that there were significant differences between studies that we could not explain. Some study authors had also presented results for core temperature, length of stay in the recovery room, and clinical side effects of the drugs. Seven studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have a higher level of sedation after surgery, and five studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have bradycardia (slower heart rate). We did not combine these results in an analysis. None of the studies presented patient‐reported outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We felt that the quality of the evidence was low and that some authors did not make enough of an effort to reduce the risk of bias in the methods, which could affect their results. For example, not all authors masked the anaesthetist or surgeon to which drug was given to each participant. This, along with some unexplained differences between studies and some concern about whether we could have missed some relevant results that had not been published, led us to assess the quality of the evidence for shivering as very low. We used GRADEpro software to assess evidence quality.
