Effect of lipid‐based nutrient supplementation on infants and young children
Review question 
What is the impact of lipid‐based nutrient supplements (LNS) plus complementary foods on health, nutrition and developmental outcomes among infants and young children? 
Background 
LNS are food products which contain energy, minerals and vitamins that can improve growth in children. LNS provide vitamins, minerals and energy in the form of protein and essential fatty acids. We sought to assess the effect of LNS given jointly with complementary feeding, compared to no intervention, micronutrient powders (MNP; a mixture of vitamins and minerals that is sprinkled onto food) and other fortified blended food (FBF) products in healthy children. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes 17 studies (from 54 reports) with 23,200 children. Four of the included studies were conducted in Malawi, three in Bangladesh, two in Ghana and one each in Burkina Faso, Haiti, Honduras, Chad, Congo, Kenya, Niger, Peru, Guatemala, and Indonesia. Four included studies enrolled pregnant women and provided LNS plus complementary feeding during pregnancy and post‐partum, followed by infant supplementation starting at six months of age. The other studies provided LNS plus complementary feeding to children after six months of age. None of the included studies were conducted in emergency settings. 
Key results 
Findings of this review suggest that LNS plus complementary feeding is probably an effective intervention for improving growth outcomes and reducing the occurrence of children who are of short stature for their age (stunting), have low weight for their age (moderate underweight), have low weight for their height (moderate wasting) and anaemia. Additionally, LNS plus complementary feeding probably improves height and weight for age as well as mid‐upper arm circumference without adverse effects among children aged six to 23 months. The intervention seems to be more effective if provided for a duration longer than 12 months. 
Evidence also suggests that LNS plus complementary probably reduces moderate stunting, moderate wasting and moderate underweight, compared to other FBF. 
Furthermore, LNS plus complementary feeding is probably more effective than MNP at reducing moderate underweight and improving height and weight. 
Quality of evidence 
Overall, we considered most studies to be at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of intervention. We rated the quality of the evidence for most outcomes as either low or moderate.
