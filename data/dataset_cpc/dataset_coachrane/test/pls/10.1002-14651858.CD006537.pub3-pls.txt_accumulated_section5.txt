Laser treatment of drusen to prevent progression to advanced age‐related macular degeneration
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effect of laser treatment of the centre of the retina in people with macular drusen to prevent the occurrence of the more advanced type of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). 
Background  Drusen are yellowish deposits that can be seen in the macula (the centre of the retina) in a larger proportion of people as they get older. People with drusen, particularly extensive large drusen, are at higher risk of developing AMD. The most common complications in AMD are the growth of new blood vessels in the centre of the macula (called choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), also known as 'wet AMD') and loss of retinal cells or photoreceptors in the macula (called geographic atrophy). It has been observed clinically that making very small burns around the macula with laser light (laser photocoagulation) makes drusen disappear. Laser photocoagulation of drusen has thus been proposed as a way to prevent the development of CNV and geographic atrophy. More recently, subthreshold photocoagulation has been used to cause invisible laser burns and achieve drusen reduction with less damage to the retinal structure. 
Search date  The evidence is current to 3 August 2015. 
Study characteristics  This review included data from 11 trials conducted in Australia, Europe and North America. The studies followed up 2159 participants with drusen (3580 eyes) to two years, of which six studies (1454 participants) included people with one eye randomised to treatment and one to control. Four studies (850 eyes) used subthreshold photocoagulation.
