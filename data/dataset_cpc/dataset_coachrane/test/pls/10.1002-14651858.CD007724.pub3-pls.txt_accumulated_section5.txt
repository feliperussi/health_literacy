Oral anti‐diabetic agents for women with diabetes or previous diabetes planning a pregnancy, or pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes 
What is the issue? 
Pre‐existing diabetes and gestational diabetes can increase the risks of a number of poor outcomes for both mothers and their babies. For the mother, these include pregnancy‐induced high blood pressure (pre‐eclampsia) with additional fluid retention and protein in the urine; and giving birth by caesarean. For the infant, these can include preterm birth; as well as an increased risk of the presence of physical defects at birth such as heart defects, brain, spine, and spinal cord defects, Down syndrome; and spontaneous abortion. Other complications at birth include babies that are large for their gestational age, and obstructed labour (shoulder dystocia) caused by one of the shoulders becoming stuck in the birth canal once the baby's head has been born. 
Why is this important? 
Being pregnant can trigger diabetes (gestational diabetes) in women with impaired glucose tolerance. Women who have had gestational diabetes are at risk of developing diabetes later in life. This means that management is important for women with impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes, as well as for women with established diabetes. Women with established diabetes need good blood sugar control before they become pregnant. Insulin gives good blood sugar control and does not affect the development of the baby, but women may find oral anti‐diabetic agents more convenient and acceptable than insulin injections. However little is known about the effects of these oral agents.
