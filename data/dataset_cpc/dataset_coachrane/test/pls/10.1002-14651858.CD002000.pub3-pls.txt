Bypass surgery for chronic lower limb ischaemia
Background
The most common symptom of chronic lower limb ischaemia (inadequate blood flow to the legs) is claudication, a cramping pain caused by a poor supply of blood to the affected muscle. It often affects the calf muscle, and is typically triggered by exercise and relieved by rest. More severe restriction of the blood supply may produce pain at rest, leg ulcers, or gangrene. These conditions, and severe claudication, may require bypass surgery or other treatments to improve blood flow to the leg. 
Key results
This review of eleven trials with a total of 1486 participants (current until October 2016) identified six trials comparing bypass surgery with angioplasty (balloon stretching and/or stent of the narrowed or occluded artery), and one each with remote endarterectomy (a combination of plaque removal and stent), thromboendarterectomy (removal of the plaque and clot), thrombolysis (clot dissolving), exercise, and spinal cord stimulation. In this review, no evidence was found to favour bypass surgery over angioplasty in terms of the effect on death, improvement of symptoms, amputation rate, need for further procedure, or long‐term mortality. Procedural complications occurred more frequently in patients with severe leg ischaemia (rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene) undergoing bypass surgery than those undergoing angioplasty. There was evidence that bypass surgery was more often technically successful, was associated with longer hospital stay, and that the bypass graft remained open (patent) at a higher rate one year after the procedure compared with angioplasty; this difference in patency in favour of surgery disappeared after four years. There was also no clear evidence to favour bypass surgery compared with other treatments, as indicated by procedural complications and deaths, clinical improvement, vessel patency, and long‐term mortality. Comparisons of bypass surgery with thrombolysis showed fewer amputations in patients subjected to bypass surgery, whereas for the rest of the comparisons the amputation rate was similar. 
Quality of the evidence
In general, the quality of the evidence was high for all but two of the clinically most important outcomes. Quality of the evidence for clinical improvement was judged to be low as this was a subjective outcome at risk of bias since the outcome assessors were not blinded to the study treatments and because there were differences in results between the studies. Quality of the evidence for patency of the bypass graft was moderate because of differences in results between the studies. Further research including large numbers of participants is needed to investigate the effectiveness of bypass surgery for chronic lower limb ischaemia.
