1. Plain Title: Comparing Different Radiation Treatments for Bone Tumors

2. Rationale: Chordoma is a rare type of bone tumor which often grows back after being removed. Surgery is the usual method of treatment, but it can cause severe side effects because the tumor can be in difficult locations. In many cases, the surrounding healthy organs can't handle high doses of radiation that would help control the tumor. Because of this, doctors are trying to find different ways to deliver radiation treatment, often with surgery, to improve results. This study aimed to compare the effects and risks of two different types of radiation treatments, known as proton and photon therapy in people with Chordoma.

3. Trial Design: We studied adults who have confirmed cases of Chordoma. They all received radiation treatment with the goal of curing their disease. We included those who were treated with either protons or photons, using various radiation therapy techniques. This included standard radiation therapy as well as more focused types. We only included studies that looked at results from both proton and photon treatments. We followed standard rules for how to conduct our research, look at our data and assess the quality of our results. 

4. Results: Our research included results of six studies involving 187 adults. We think all the studies were at a high risk of being biased. 
We found that there was very little clear evidence to show a difference between proton and photon therapy on whether the tumor grew back, how long people lived, tumor recurrence and side effects from treatment. Some patients receiving proton therapy experienced damage due to radiation including conditions affecting the temporal bone, brainstem, and mastoiditis while a patient receiving photon therapy experienced a hearing loss. We could not conclude whether proton led to reduced toxicity. We found no strong evidence that one type of radiation therapy is better than the other for treating Chordoma. 

Finally, due to the lack of clear evidence, we believe it is necessary to collect and publish more data, particularly as radiation techniques become more advanced, so we can better determine the most beneficial radiation treatment techniques for these patients.
