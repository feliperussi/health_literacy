1. Plain Title:
Understanding the Best Surgical Procedure for Stoma Placement

2. Rationale:
A 'stoma' is a surgically-made opening in the body, helping in waste removal from the body. A parastomal hernia, a common issue linked with a stoma, occurs when the organ near the stoma pushes through and creates a bulge. This study was conducted to see if placing the opening either through or alongside the abdominal muscle could make a difference in the chance of getting a parastomal hernia or other stoma-related problems. 

3. Trial Design:
The research team looked at different studies that had already been completed. These included both studies where people had been randomly assigned to receive either type of stoma placement and studies where this wasn't the case. They looked at four medical record databases and two clinical trial registers to find studies up to November 9, 2018, without any language restrictions. The team aimed to compare the two methods of stoma placement and observe their connection to stoma-related issues such as parastomal hernia.

4. Results:
The team saw that only one trial where patients were randomly assigned met their criteria. This trial contained 60 participants who needed a stoma for various reasons. The results were unclear, and they could not determine if one technique was more likely to result in a parastomal hernia, ileus or stenosis (blocking or narrowing of the stoma), or skin irritation. Quality of life was also measured in this trial, but this was not one of the intended outcomes of the researchers' study. 

They also looked at ten other studies which were not random and had a total of 864 participants. These studies also did not give a clear answer. They could not conclude from these studies whether different techniques could raise the chances of getting a parastomal hernia or another issue where the stoma slips out of place (stomal prolapse).

To sum up, this research did not provide enough information to favor one surgical method of stoma placement over the other in preventing stoma-related issues. More high-quality research is needed to find the best surgical technique for stoma placement.
