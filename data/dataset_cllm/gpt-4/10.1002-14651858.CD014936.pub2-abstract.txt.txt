1. Plain Title: 
The Benefits of Quitting Smoking After a Heart Issue

2. Rationale: 
Heart diseases caused by smoking and their secondary events are a significant health concern. People who have had a heart problem (the medical term is coronary heart disease or CHD) could prevent further heart problems by quitting smoking. This study was carried out to understand the benefits of stopping smoking on individuals who have already been diagnosed with CHD. We explored how quitting might reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or experiencing other major heart trouble (known in medical terms as Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events or MACE). 

3. Trial Design: 
In this research, we looked at several studies that included adults over 18 years old who smoked and had been diagnosed with CHD. We wanted specifically to understand if they quit smoking or continued to smoke after being diagnosed. These findings included a variety of outcomes over the six-month follow-up cycle. The two main outcomes we focused on were death from heart disease (CVD) and major heart issues (MACE). We also looked at several other outcomes like all-cause death, heart attacks that didn't end in death, strokes that didn't end in death, new cases of chest pain (angina), and any changes in quality of life. 

4. Results: 
We studied 68 studies that had a total of about 80,700 people. The results showed that people who stopped smoking were at a lower risk of death from heart disease and other major heart troubles compared to those who kept smoking. They were also at a lower risk of death from any cause, heart attacks, and strokes that didn't end in death. One study showed that those who quit smoking also had less chance of having angina. Lastly, there was no worsening in the quality of life for those who stopped smoking, and some evidence suggested that quitting might even improve their quality of life. 

Still, the results varied greatly between studies, and some might have been affected by other factors. The results' certainty was 'moderate' for the reduced risk of death from heart diseases and 'low' for reducing the risk of major heart troubles. 

In conclusion, quitting smoking after a diagnosis of heart disease can lower the chances of further heart trouble by around a third. That's because stopping smoking helps the body recover normal function of endothelial and platelet, both important for heart health. This study supports the idea that there is less risk of more heart trouble in people who quit smoking than in those who continue, and that quitting may also boost quality of life. More studies can help us confirm these findings.
