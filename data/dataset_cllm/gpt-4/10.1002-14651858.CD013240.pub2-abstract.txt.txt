1. Plain Title: 
    "Study Investigating a Hormone Treatment Ahead of IVF for Patients with Endometriosis"

2. Rationale: 
    Endometriosis is a condition that can affect a woman's ability to have a baby. It's a common problem and many women with this condition need help to get pregnant. The treatment options include in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), both are special techniques used to help a woman become pregnant. Some experts thought that using a hormone therapy called GnRH agnoist before IVF or ICSI might increase a woman's chances of getting pregnant. That's why this study was done, to see if this hormone treatment ahead of IVF or ICSI can actually increase the chances of pregnancy for women with endometriosis.

3. Trial Design: 
    We wanted to find out if long-term use (minimum 3 months) of GnRH agonist treatment before IVF or ICSI could have benefits for women with endometriosis. To get our answers, we looked at many studies from different places that were published until January 8, 2019. We only included studies where women had endometriosis confirmed by surgery and were either given GnRH agonist treatment for at least three months before an IVF/ICSI procedure, or weren't treated or were treated in a different way. 

4. Results: 
    We found eight studies that matched what we were looking for, and these involved a total of 640 women. Based on the information from these studies, we aren't sure if this hormone treatment before IVF or ICSI can improve the chances of having a baby or reduce the risk of complications. We're also not certain if this hormone treatment would affect the chances of getting pregnant, having more than one baby at once, having a miscarriage, or the number of eggs or embryos a woman could produce. Because of this uncertainty and the limited high-quality studies available, we think more detailed studies are needed to find out for sure if long-term GnRH agonist therapy could help women with endometriosis when they are undergoing IVF or ICSI. We also need to compare this treatment with other treatment options for managing endometriosis.
