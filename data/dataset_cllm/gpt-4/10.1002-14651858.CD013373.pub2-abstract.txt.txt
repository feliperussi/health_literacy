1. Plain Title: Exploring Benefits of Patients and Health Providers Planning Health Services Together

2. Rationale: Traditionally, health services focus on specific diseases. However, there is a growing sense that making these services more patient-focused could lead to better care for individuals. The idea is to involve everyday people - or "consumers" - in deciding how health services are planned, delivered, and checked for effectiveness. Some worldwide governments recommend this approach. It's like a partnership between health providers and individuals who use these services. Still, it's not clear if this partnership approach truly leads to better, patient-focused health services.

3. Trial Design: To get a better understanding, a study was conducted. In this study, certain criteria were used to define these partnership efforts: these included opportunities for consumers and providers to meet regularly in formal settings and make actual, significant decisions that reflect the needs and priorities of the patients. The focus of this study was specifically on interventions that used this partnership model. Researchers looked at past studies and trial registries from 2000 to 2019. They selected studies that could accurately measure the impact of the partnership model.

4. Results: The study included five trials with over 16,000 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Some aimed to directly improve the patient-centeredness of health services, while others had more indirect or broader focuses. The impact from these partnership models was unclear. Some suggested little to no difference in how health services changed or how users rated these services. The certainty of these findings was very low due to various potential biases and inconsistencies among the studies.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of patients and health providers working together to decide health services remains uncertain due to low-quality evidence. Further well-designed studies are needed to provide a clearer picture of the partnership model's benefits. These could focus more on assessing outcomes directly related to partnerships for patient-centred health services and use a blend of research methods to build the evidence base.
