1. Plain Title: 
Understanding How Day Care Programs Can Reduce Drowning Deaths in Children 

2. Rationale: 
Around the world, drowning causes an estimated 320,000 deaths each year. Drowning happens the most in places where people are not very wealthy, especially in the rural settings where the majority of cases happen in natural bodies of water close to home. This is a major problem for kids aged 1 to 4 years old. We wanted to look into ways we can protect children from drowning. One of the things we decided to test was whether putting kids in day care programs could help reduce the numbers of kids drowning.

3. Trial Design: 
We carried out the study using information from different studies collected from reputable databases and trial registries. We looked at studies that made use of day care programs to prevent drowning or injury, among preschool-aged children (below 6 years of age) in areas where people are not very wealthy. These day care programs could be on their own, or combined with other things, like activities to teach kids about safety, or making sure parents could keep kids safe. The study duration varied across the selected research but one of the observational studies lasted for a period of 4 years and 8 months.

4. Results: 
We found two important studies that were carried out in rural Bangladesh. The first one had a total of 136,577 participants. In that study, it was more than just a day care program. The program also involved teaching parents and providing play yards to parents, and organizing other activities in the community. Results showed that this program could likely lower the chances of a child dying from drowning. The study also mentioned that for every year of disability-free life saved as a result of less drowning, it cost 812 USD, which was pretty reasonable.

The second study compared day care programs with and without play yards provided to parents against only providing play yards to parents as a way to prevent drowning. This study however had a lot of challenges, and because of that its results aren't very reliable. But, it suggested that a day care program could possibly reduce the rate of drowning deaths compared to just providing play yards to parents. 

The results pointed out that day care programs, when combined with community-education, parental education, and providing play yards to parents, could likely lower the risk of drowning deaths in areas with a high number of drowning cases, compared to doing nothing at all.
