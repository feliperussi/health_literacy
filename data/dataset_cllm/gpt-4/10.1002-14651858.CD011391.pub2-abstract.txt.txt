1. Plain Title: Studying two types of surgery for treating pancreatic cancer

2. Rationale: Pancreatic cancer is a severe illness where abnormal cells grow in the organ that helps with digestion and blood sugar regulation. The current best chance for a long-term survival is through surgical removal of the affected parts of the pancreas. This type of surgery can be open, where a large cut is made, or laparoscopic, involving smaller cuts and a tiny camera. With surgeries on other organs, the laparoscopic method has shown to cause fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. However, it's unclear if this surgery method is as effective and safe when treating pancreatic cancer. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate these two surgery types' benefits and risks.

3. Trial Design: This investigation sorted through various studies done up to June 2015. We searched databases and trial registers to find studies that compared results of both surgery types in patients with operable pancreatic cancer. Two reviewers carefully looked over the studies and gathered data independently. In total, we examined 12 studies involving 1576 patients, 394 of whom chose laparoscopic surgery and 1182 open surgery.

4. Results: None of the 12 studies we found were randomised trials, meaning there might be some bias in their results. The studies generally suggested similar death and complication rates for both types of surgery. Cancer also seemed to return in comparable numbers between the two methods. However, the surgical method didn't appear to impact patients' chances of a successful operation (clear cancer margins). Patients who chose laparoscopic surgery did stay in the hospital for roughly two days less than those opting for open surgery. Still, we need more high-quality, randomised trials to definitively confirm these results. These future trials should consider aspects like short-term and long-term death rates, quality of life post-surgery, complications, hospital stay length and cancer recurrence.
