Plain Title: 
Understanding if "Whole Body Freezing" Helps Reduce Muscle Soreness After Exercise

Rationale:
Muscle soreness after exercise can be discomforting, affecting day-to-day activities and lowering quality of life. One strategy which is suggested to ease this condition is called "Whole-body Cryotherapy." This means going into a special room or cabin for a few minutes where the air is extremely cold, even below -100 Â°C. The aim of this study was to determine if this cooling method indeed helps to reduce muscle soreness and improve recovery in adults after exercise. The researchers felt this study was needed as there isn't enough clear information about the potential benefits of whole-body cryotherapy. 

Trial Design: 
The researchers started by collecting data from previous studies that have already explored this topic. They targeted studies that randomly chose who will take the freezing therapy and who won't. They were also interested in those studies that tested different methods, lengths, and frequencies of the therapy. They included physically active young adults with an average age of 23 in their review. Their main focus was on muscle soreness, feelings of recovery, and any harm caused by the therapy.

Results:
Four studies were included in the review. They involved a little over 60 people, most of them men. The researchers found that the quality of the evidence in these studies was very low. This was due to differences in how the cold therapy was given in the studies, the type of exercise before the therapy, and also the lack of clear reporting of any harm against participants.

The reviewed studies found that the freezing therapy was better than just resting or not having any therapy when it comes to feeling less sore at different times after the exercise. However, these results are not very reliable. One small study found no difference in tiredness but better well-being after freezing therapy at 24 hours post-exercise. No studies reported any harm by the therapy.

When comparing freezing therapy with infrared therapy, one study found lesser soreness after freezing therapy at one hour after the exercise, but not at 24 or 48 hours.

In conclusion, the researchers determined that there isn't enough reliable evidence to say for sure that whole body cooling helps reduce muscle soreness and improve recovery after exercise in young adult males. There is also no information on whether this therapy is useful for women or professional athletes. The lack of data on any potential harm from this extremely cold therapy is concerning. The researchers strongly feel that more quality research is needed in this area to better understand the safety and potential benefits of this therapy.
