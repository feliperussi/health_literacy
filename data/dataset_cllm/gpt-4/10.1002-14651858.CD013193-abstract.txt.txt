Checking Skin Cancer Accuracy Through Online Dermatology Consultations

2. Rationale
Skin cancer is a significant health concern. The three primary types (melanoma, squamous cell, and basal cell carcinoma) differ in their severity and possible outcomes. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma can spread to other parts of the body and can lead to death. Basal cell carcinoma can damage surrounding tissue but primarily remains localized. It's crucial to detect skin cancers as early as possible as early detection can result in better patient outcomes. However, there is a balance to maintain between catching potential cases and creating unnecessary worry and procedures for benign (non-cancerous) skin conditions. One possible solution is teledermatology, which is the use of technology to link general doctors with a specialist skin doctor or dermatologist. This can be done by sending images for review at a later time or having a real-time consultation with the patient, general doctor, and dermatologist. This study aimed to see how accurate teledermatology is for diagnosing skin cancer and how it compares with a face-to-face diagnosis.

3. Trial Design
The researchers designed the study to answer these questions by searching various databases of medical studies, research articles, and previous systematic reviews up to August 2016. They selected studies that evaluated skin cancer diagnoses made via teledermatology alone or in comparison with an in-person diagnosis by a specialist. They then extracted all necessary data, including some required follow-ups with researchers when information was incomplete. They combined data from multiple studies to get an overall view of teledermatology's accuracy.

4. Results
After reviewing and analysing 22 studies that involved 4057 skin lesions, the research concludes that teledermatology can correctly identify most malignant (cancerous) skin lesions. For correctly diagnosing such skin lesions using photographic images, teledermatology was found to be about 95% accurate in identifying malignant cases and 84% accurate in identifying non-cancerous cases based on the data from four studies. The referral accuracy data compared teledermatology against a face-to-face diagnosis and suggested a good agreement for lesions requiring further action taken (with accuracies over 90%). However, the results were more varied where lesions were of less concern by in-person assessment. 

In conclusion, while these results demonstrate a substantial potential for teledermatology to facilitate early skin cancer detection, the studies reviewed were generally small, varied considerably and didn't always reflect the settings in which teledermatology is typically used, limiting their generalizability. Thus, further research is needed to understand and maximize this promising approach's full potential.
