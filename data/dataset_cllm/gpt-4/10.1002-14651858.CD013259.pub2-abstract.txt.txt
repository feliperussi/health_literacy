1. Plain Title: 
"Preparing Patients Before Colorectal Cancer Surgery to Better Recover"

2. Rationale:
Colorectal cancer, which affects our large intestine, is often treated through surgery. But even if the surgery can cure the cancer, it can also cause other health problems afterwards. So, some doctors have been using 'recovery programmes' to help patients get better faster after surgery. These programmes involve several steps taken before and after surgery. But researchers believe that more can be done before surgery to prepare patients. This 'preparation' is what they call 'prehabilitation'. It includes exercise, proper nutrition and techniques to reduce anxiety, all before surgery. The goal is to help patients become more resilient, helping them recover better after surgery. 

3. Trial Design:
This study aimed to measure the effects of 'prehabilitation' on adult patients getting surgery for colorectal cancer. The researchers looked at how prehabilitation affects patients' ability to do daily tasks, how quickly they recover after surgery, and their quality of life. They compared results from patients who received prehabilitation with those who did not.

The researchers included studies with patients who had colorectal cancer but it had not yet spread, and who were planning to have surgery. These studies compared patients who got prehabilitation involving at least two preparations (like exercise and nutrition) before surgery, with those who got no prehabilitation. 

The researchers were interested in seeing how prehabilitation affected:
- The patients' ability to do daily tasks 
- How fast they recovered from surgery
- How many complications they faced after surgery 
- Their quality of life
- Their willingness and success in following the prehabilitation programme
- How safe the programme was
- How quickly they returned to their normal activities.

4. Results: 
The study involved three trials including 250 participants who were about to have surgery for colorectal cancer. Of these, 130 patients received a four-week prehabilitation programme involving exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction. Their results were compared with 120 patients who received the same programme but after surgery.

Results showed that patients who received prehabilitation could do daily tasks better and faster after surgery. Further, these patients had fewer complications and less emergency department visits after surgery. Remaining outcomes, like the rate at which the patients could grip objects, how many days they stayed in the hospital, death rate, quality of life, return to normal activities, safety and patient willingness to stick to the program was either not reported or was inadequate.

The research group warns that the results should be interpreted with caution due to some risk of bias, uncertainty, and inconsistency in the findings.

In conclusion, the researchers found that prehabilitation could help patients getting surgery for colorectal cancer recover faster and experience fewer complications. However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings.
