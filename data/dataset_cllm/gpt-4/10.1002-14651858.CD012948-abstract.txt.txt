1. Plain Title:
Deciding the Best Time for Delivery in Pregnant Women With Diabetes 

2. Rationale:
Pregnancy can pose additional challenges for women with pre-existing diabetes, either Type 1 or Type 2. Studies have shown these women can experience a higher risk of negative health outcomes for themselves and their babies. Doctors often advise these women to have their babies at, or near, full term (37 to 40 weeks of pregnancy), based on the understanding risks may increase during the final part of the pregnancy. However, this approach isn't completely validated. The purpose of this study was to find out whether scheduling birth around full term is better or worse for mother and baby than waiting (expectant approach) for labor to start naturally.

3. Trial Design:
The research team looked to evaluate and compare health outcomes for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes and their babies, when the labor was planned at or near term versus an expectant approach (waiting for labor to start naturally). The aim was to include both randomized trials (where women are randomly assigned to have a planned or expectant approach), and non-randomized trials (such as studies where women alternate between the two approaches). The search for relevant studies utilized several databases and registries such as the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and references from other relevant studies, up until August 2017.

4. Results:
Despite the comprehensive search approach, the researchers could not find any relevant published trials that collected the necessary information to answer the question. There was one trial identified that looked at whether choosing to wait for labor to start naturally might lower the chance of needing a caesarean section in women with diabetes (both pre-existing and gestational). However, the results from this trial were excluded as the data did not separate the women with pre-existing diabetes from those with gestational diabetes. In conclusion, this review highlights the urgent need for good quality studies that explore the health outcomes of planned labor at or near term versus an expectant approach in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. At this point, there is simply no clear evidence to suggest the best course of action.
