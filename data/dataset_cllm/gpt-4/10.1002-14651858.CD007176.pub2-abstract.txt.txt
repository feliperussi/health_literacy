1. Plain Title: 
Effects of Antioxidant Supplements on Lifespan

2. Rationale: 
This study was done to see if vitamins or supplements such as Beta-carotene, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Selenium, which are commonly known as antioxidants, can increase or decrease a person's lifespan. We know that our bodies need these vitamins to function correctly, but we wanted to see if taking extra supplements can improve or hurt our health.

3. Trial Design: 
This study gathered data from 78 previous studies, including nearly 300,000 people. The people in these studies ranged from 18 all the way to 103 years old, with women making up about half of them. They were people with ongoing health conditions as well as healthy individuals. The studies we looked over tested these supplements in different ways, some gave them alone, others mixed with other vitamins or minerals. The amount of time the people were taking these supplements ranged from 1 month to 12 years.

4. Results: 
The overall findings showed that these antioxidant supplements did not have a significant effect on lifespan. In some cases, they actually seemed to increase the risk of death. Specifically, Beta-carotene and Vitamin E supplements appeared to increase the risk of death. Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Selenium did not have a significant effect on lifespan. Moreover, higher doses of Vitamin A were linked to an increased risk of death. This research shows that antioxidant supplements should be treated like medicines, and be thoroughly tested before being marketed to people.
