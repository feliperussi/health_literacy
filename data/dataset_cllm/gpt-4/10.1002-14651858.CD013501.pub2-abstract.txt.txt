1. Plain Title: 
Effects of Vegan Diets on Heart Disease Risks 

2. Rationale:
Heart disease or cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common health problem and diet can play a huge role in how it develops. If you can change your diet, you can lessen some of the risk of heart problems. Lately, people are eating a lot of vegan diets, which means they don't eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and honey. But, we need to really know if a vegan diet can help stop heart disease from starting or getting worse. That's why we did this research.

3. Trial Design:
Our study looked at different types of people, some healthy and some at high risk of heart disease, as well as people who already have heart disease. We compared those who followed a vegan diet against those who did not make any changes or made other changes to their diet. The goal was to see if there was a change in factors that can lead to heart disease. We didn't limit our search to just English, and we only included trials that lasted for at least 12 weeks. Two members of our team picked the trials to use, gathered the needed info, and figured out if the trials were risky or not.

4. Results:
In total, we looked at 13 trials that have been finished and 8 that are still going on. The majority of these trials were looking at preventing heart disease. None of the trials looked at actual heart events, just things like cholesterol and blood pressure. 

When we compared a vegan diet to no changes in the diet, we saw that the vegan diet led to a small drop in total cholesterol and LDL (or "bad") cholesterol but a tiny increase in HDL (or "good") cholesterol and another kind of fat in your blood. But, changes in HDL and other blood fats were not in the direction we expected. The vegan diet didn't seem to have any effect on blood pressure. 

When we compared a vegan diet to other kinds of diets, there didn't seem to be any effect on cholesterol or blood fat levels or on blood pressure. 

There was only one trial that looked at people who already had heart disease, so we can't really say what effect a vegan diet might have on them. 

In four of the trials, no major bad things happened to people because of the vegan diet. 

In summary, the trials we looked at were small and didn't have many people. Plus, none of them looked at real heart events happening. At this point, we can't say for sure that a vegan diet changes the factors that can lead to heart disease. We do know that eight ongoing studies will add more info to our knowledge, and maybe help us understand better. But right now, there's just not enough data, especially when it comes to people who already have heart disease.
