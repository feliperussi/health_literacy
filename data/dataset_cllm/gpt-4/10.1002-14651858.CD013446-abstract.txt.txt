1. Plain Title: 
Effect of Different Levels of Vitamin D Intake on Pregnancy Health 

2. Rationale:
Pregnant women sometimes don't have enough Vitamin D, which can lead to health problems for the mother and the baby. These problems can include pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure), gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy), low birthweight in babies, and giving birth too soon (preterm birth). Previous studies suggested that taking vitamin D might lower the risk of some of these problems. But it was not clear if the amount of vitamin D a woman takes could make a difference. This study was done to see if taking more than the usual recommended amount of vitamin D during pregnancy could affect these risks and if it might cause any other health problems. 

3. Trial Design: 
This study looked at many other studies that had been done before to gather as much information as possible. These smaller studies all tested how different amounts of Vitamin D might affect a woman's pregnancy. Some women took the usually recommended amount. Others took more or less. All the women in these studies were in different stages of their pregnancies. The researchers put together the information from all these studies to see what patterns they could find.

4. Results: 
After looking at 30 studies with 7289 women, the researchers found that taking more than the standard amount of Vitamin D did not really change the risk of having high blood pressure during pregnancy. However, it may lower the risk of getting diabetes during pregnancy. It did not seem to affect the risk of giving birth too soon or having a baby with low birth weight. 

Taking much more than the suggested amount of Vitamin D (4000 international units or more per day), again did not seem to change the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, preterm birth, or low birthweight. In terms of safety, the researchers did not find that taking Vitamin D caused any serious health issues for the women.

In summary, taking more Vitamin D than currently recommended during pregnancy may help to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes, but it does not seem to lower or heighten the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birthweight. Vitamin D appears to be safe to take during pregnancy, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. There are 16 more studies being done right now that will add more information to what we know about Vitamin D and pregnancy.
