1. Plain Title: 
Understanding Mental Health Care Approaches for Refugees and Other Displaced People

2. Rationale:
A major concern for individuals who are forced to leave their homes (like refugees, asylum seekers, and people displaced within their home country) is maintaining good mental health. These people often encounter high-stress situations, which can result in mental health problems. However, methods to prevent or treat these problems may not always work well for this group. This study was carried out to look at existing reviews and plans for reviews on promoting mental health and preventing or treating mental illness among these groups. The findings from this study may help guide future research on the mental health of displaced people.

3. Trial Design:
The study team looked at a wide range of databases to find reviews of mental health care approaches for displaced people. The databases included research from as far back as 1945, and any language, date, or publication status was considered. They were looking for reviews or study plans about strategies specifically designed to help refugees, asylum seekers or people displaced within their country cope with their mental health. These could involve things like learning about well-being in school for kids, or therapies for trauma to prevent stress disorders or treat symptoms of trauma. The team reviewed articles and pulled out information about the reviews, what the reviews studied, and how many original studies were included in each review.

4. Results:
The team discovered 23 reviews and 15 plans for reviews. Amidst all the 23 reviews, 8 had analysed data from a collection of research studies. The most common therapies identified involved cognitive behavioural therapy, narrative exposure therapy, and several integrative and interpersonal therapies. However, many reviews didn't make a clear distinction between mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment. 

The reviews included a total of 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. However, a good number of these reviews had some limitations, like poor reporting of selection criteria, no use of protocols, poor reporting of study design, unclear search strategy, and lack of information on how the original studies were funded. 

The study concluded that there are gaps in knowledge about mental health care approaches for refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people. More information is needed on ways to promote good mental health and prevent common mental disorders among these groups. Mental health care in children also needs more attention. There's also a need for better reports on how these reviews were designed and carried out which would be beneficial for professionals looking for ways to improve mental health in displaced persons.
