1. Plain Title: Understanding how Communication Tools Help People with Breathing Tubes Speak

2. Rationale: Artificial airway tubes are often needed for those who struggle to breath on their own. Yet, these tubes can stop those affected from being able to communicate, which can lead to feelings of stress and low-quality care. Some helpful tools can offer ways to communicate, from those that produce writing or signs, to those that actually produce speech. This study aimed to review how well these tools work for patients who have these breathing tubes. We wanted to see if these tools can really help people express their needs and feelings. We also wanted to gauge if these tools might improve patient satisfaction, reduce feelings of stress and relate to how long patients stay in the hospital.

3. Trial Design: The study checked a range of trials and research databases to gather information about these communication tools. The trials chosen were those which specifically tested these tools with adults who had artificial airways. We focused on 11 studies which in total examined 1931 patients in intensive care units. Some of these trials tested communication tools that use signs or writing, and some tested tools that help patients produce speech.

4. Results: The confidence we now have in whether these communication tools help patients is quite low. This is due to different types of measurements used in these trials, mixed results and unclear information. Many of these trials did not provide the results on whether communication boards (non-vocal tools) made any difference. The trials about speech tools are also unclear if there was any improvement in patients' ability to speak. It is still uncertain if these tools improve patient satisfaction or not. Although some people reported less stress, it is also unclear whether these tools improved patients' quality of life or reduced feelings of stress. These communication aids also seem to have no real effect on how long patients stay in intensive care. And, only three of those trials mentioned potential negatives from using these tools, like restraint use, bleeding differences, or changes in breathing. Because of these results, it is still uncertain if there are any potential harms from using these communication tools. 

In conclusion, we still do not have enough clear, high-quality information to decide which type of communication tool works best and at what time it should be used. If we want to truly understand these tools, better ways to measure results are required.
