1. Plain Title: Comparing Treatments for Severe Eczema: How Well They Work and How Safe They Are 
   
2. Rationale: Eczema is a persistent skin condition that can cause rashes, itching, and discomfort, significantly impacting quality of life. While some treatments aim to manage the condition, their success rates and side effects are not fully understood. This study aims to compare the benefits and safety of different kinds of treatments for severe eczema, mainly focusing on drugs that suppress the immune system called immunosuppressants.
   
3. Trial Design: This study examined data gathered from previous controlled trials where people with mild to severe eczema were treated with immunosuppressants and compared against a control group receiving a placebo (a dummy treatment) or different eczema treatments. The trials used in the study included a diverse range of patients, aged between 2 and 84 years, with a slightly higher proportion being males. The duration of these previous studies varied, ranging anywhere from 2 weeks to 5 years of treatment. The effectiveness of each treatment was mainly evaluated based on the proportion of patients who saw at least a 75% improvement in their eczema symptoms, and any observed improvement in their day-to-day lives. The safety of each treatment was assessed by noting any severe side effects or infections between patients.

4. Results: A total of 74 studies were analyzed, including thousands of patients. The study concluded that a biological treatment called dupilumab was the most effective in reducing eczema symptoms in the short term. Dupilumab's results were noticeably better than a placebo, showing over three times the chance of causing a large improvement in eczema symptoms. The other treatments tested were not as effective, or the evidence of their effectiveness was unclear. As for side effects, the evidence suggested fewer severe side effects for patients using a treatment called QAW039 and dupilumab compared to a placebo. But the study could not identify a significant difference in side effects for other treatments. The study concluded recommending further trials to compare the long-term effectiveness and safety between existing eczema treatments.
