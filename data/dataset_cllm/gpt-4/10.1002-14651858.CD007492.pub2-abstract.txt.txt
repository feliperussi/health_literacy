1. Plain Title: 
Improving Health Services for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities

2. Rationale: 
People with intellectual disabilities often live shorter life spans, face more health problems, and may have trouble accessing healthcare. This is compared to those who do not have an intellectual disability. The way healthcare services are provided â€“ the structure and way they are delivered - can be changed to help. Previously, no research had studied this area. The main aim of the study was to see if changing the way healthcare services are provided could improve the mental and physical wellbeing of those with intellectual disabilities. 

3. Trial Design: 
This study is an update of a previous study. In this updated study, we searched numerous databases for recent studies, from April 2006 up to September 4, 2015. Only research studies aimed at improving care for adult individuals with an intellectual disability were included. Such studies should be random, meaning the individuals in these studies were assigned randomly to see different healthcare practices. In total, we reviewed seven studies involving 347 individuals. 

4. Results: 
The seven studies we reviewed tried different ways of improving care. Some increased how often and how much care was given. Others included community therapy specifically for behavior issues or outreach treatment. However, these studies only focused on mental health issues, and not physical health issues. 

We learned that increasing the frequency and intensity of care, or providing outreach treatment, may not lower behavior issues for those with intellectual disabilities. A small decrease in behavior problems was seen with special community therapy for behavior issues. Increasing the care also did not change the burden of care that caregivers experience. 

Unfortunately, the studies didn't provide much evidence on the costs of these different methods. Thus, we can't say for certain which way is better for arranging healthcare services. We didn't find any studies that specialized in health services for individuals with intellectual disabilities and physical health problems. 

In conclusion, there is an urgent need for more in-depth research. This is to figure out the best way to provide health services for individuals with intellectual disabilities, especially those with physical health problems. This is the only way we can ensure these individuals are getting the care that they need.
