1. Plain Title: The Impact of Timing Intercourse on Pregnancy Rates

2. Rationale: Fertility issues are more common than we think, affecting 10% to 15% of couples wanting to have children. One of the possible causes is not having sexual intercourse at the right time. A woman can only conceive from about five days before ovulation (when an egg is released from an ovary) up to several hours after. This is known as the 'fertile period'. Therefore, one way to increase the chances of getting pregnant is to figure out when this ovulation happens and time intercourse accordingly. This method could improve conception rates, save time and costs related to fertility treatments, but it may also cause stress. This study aims to understand better whether methods predicting ovulation would really help couples trying to conceive.

3. Trial Design: This research used previous studies (randomised controlled trials) to compare the outcomes of timed intercourse to outcomes of intercourse without attention to ovulation timing. We also compared different ways of predicting ovulation. In total, the studies included a diverse group of 2,840 women or couples. Unfortunately, data from one large study couldn't be used because it didn't provide enough information by group.

4. Results: We found that having sex timed with ovulation might lead to higher pregnancy rates compared to having sex without any timing. However, the quality of this evidence is low, and more research is needed before we can be sure of this. One study also looked at stress levels and didn't find any evidence that timed intercourse caused more stress. No clear evidence suggested that timed intercourse resulted in more live births or had negative effects. One thing to note is that one significant study did not publish its results even after eight years, and this may have skewed our findings. So, while our initial findings suggest timed intercourse may help increase the chances of becoming pregnant, more research on this subject is needed to be certain.
