Plain Title:
Exploring Treatment Options for Kids Struggling with Intermittent Crossed Eyes

Rationale:
Intermittent exotropia, or occasionally crossed eyes, is a condition that particularly affects children between 1 to 10 years of age. It can create a lot of difficulties and negatively affect their quality of life. This condition can often lead to issues like poor vision due to the eyes not working together. This study was designed to find out which treatment options are the best and to judge if they're more effective at certain stages of the disease. This study is needed because there's confusion over the right time to intervene and which treatment type is the most beneficial. 

Trial Design:
This study included six trials involving kids majorly with basic or distance-type intermittent crossed eyes. These trials were mostly conducted in the United States and Asia. Kids subjected to these trials were aged from 12 months to 10 years. We looked at many different treatments including, but not limited to, eye-muscle surgery, prism glasses, and use of eye patches. The study aimed at understanding how these treatments affect the child's vision and quality of life, so we took quite a bit of time to carefully observe their impacts.

Results:
The trials showed that an eye patch helped children with this eye problem better than just observing and waiting. What it does is help the eyes work better together. To be specific, the study showed their eye alignment improved significantly with patching compared to those who were not. Other treatments such as eye muscle surgery or prism glasses were also tested but the results were not clear enough to declare them beneficial. The study also paid attention to the toll of these treatments on children like pain, discomfort, or other adverse effects, but these were generally not expected with non-surgical treatment like patching. 

Conclusions from the study culminate that the best choice for helping youngsters with intermittent crossed eyes seems to be using an eye patch, especially for those who are between 1 to 10 years of age. However, more evidence is needed to decide about the usefulness of other interventions and treatments.
