Plain Title: Comparing Birth Control Patch, Ring, and Pill: Efficiency and Usability

Rationale: Scientists are exploring new methods of contraception besides the oral pills mainly used today. Two of these new methods are the contraceptive patch and vaginal ring. The idea is that these new methods could work better because they don't have to pass through the digestive system and users might find them easier to keep using correctly. This study aims to understand how effective these methods are, how well women can maintain their usage, and if they are safe, comparing them to oral contraceptive pills.

Trial Design: This study was done by reviewing and analyzing information from randomized controlled trials from multiple online databases till February 2013. These trials all compared the birth control patch or ring to birth control pills. The data was taken from 18 trials, 6 about the patch, and 12 about the ring.

Results: 
The findings showed that the birth control patch and ring were as effective in preventing pregnancy as the birth control pills. The results also showed that women were better at using the patch consistently compared to the pill in some trials. However, women using the patch stopped using it earlier than those using the pill in several instances. Interestingly, the reason for early discontinuation was due to the discomfort side effects of the patch such as breast discomfort, pain during periods, feeling sick, and vomiting.

In the case of the vaginal ring, some trials showed women were better at using the ring consistently, while others showed the opposite. Women using the ring were less likely to stop using it due to side effects in one trial. The vaginal ring also produced fewer side effects than the pill but increased vaginal discomfort and unusual discharge.

Overall, the birth control patches and rings were as effective as the pills. Women using the patch had more side-effects than the women using pills. On the other hand, women using the ring had fewer side effects than the pill users but experienced more vaginal discomfort and discharge. Therefore, women might choose to switch between these methods based on their comfort and the side effects they experience.

Remember: Contraceptive methods are individual experiences, and what works best for one person might not be ideal for another. It's important to talk to a healthcare provider and assess your own body's reactions and comfort when choosing your birth control method.

Conclusions: This research suggests that birth control patch and ring may be viable alternatives to pills, with some potential advantages and disadvantages. Additional research will need to be conducted to confirm these findings.
