1. Plain Title:
Studying the Effects of Medications on Self-Harm in Adults

2. Rationale:
Self-harm, an act where a person hurts themselves on purpose, is a growing issue in most countries. This includes behaviors like purposely taking too much medication or causing physical injury to oneself. These acts, sometimes related to mental health issues, can lead to suicide if not addressed. While therapy and mental support can help, we aren't sure if medications or natural treatments can do the same. So, we did a research project to find out if such treatments can reduce self-harm in adults.

3. Trial Design:
We looked at past studies that tested medicines or natural remedies to reduce self-harm in adults 18 years or older. The studies we picked compared self-harm rates in people who were given a medication or natural product with others who were not, or were given a different treatment. The people included in these studies had hurt themselves within the past six months and needed medical support. The treatments were studied for up to two years, and we checked if self-harm was repeated, if the patients liked the treatment, if they stuck to it, how it affected their feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and their social life and general wellness. We ended up reviewing seven studies with a total of 574 people, most of them women and with an average age of 35 years.

4. Results:
Here’s what we found. Some new antidepressants might help lower self-harm, but we’re not sure. They might work better than a placebo, which is a pill that doesn't have any medicine in it, but looks and tastes like a real one. Antipsychotic medications, another kind of drug that helps with mental health problems, might be more effective. Self-harm was reduced in about 21% of the people receiving antipsychotic medications compared to 75% who got a placebo. But we didn't see a big difference when other types of drugs were used as a comparison. Mood stabilizers and natural products, like vitamins or herbal supplements, didn't seem to work better than a placebo either. 

The evidence we found is low and uncertain because there were only a few studies with a small number of people. We need more research on this topic, particularly more extensive studies that test newer medications, including new types of antipsychotic drugs. We also need to know more about the side effects of these treatments. In the future, we should explore how medications can work together with psychological treatments, like talking with a therapist, to see if this combination can help reduce self-harm.
