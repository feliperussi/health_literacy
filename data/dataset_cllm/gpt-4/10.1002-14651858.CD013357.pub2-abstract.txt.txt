Plain Title:
Exploring The Use of Silicone Gel Sheets in Treating Raised Scars

Rationale:
Every year, millions of people around the world develop scars caused by an injury, surgery, or sometimes, conditions like burns. Some of these scars, and especially the raised ones (known as hypertrophic scars), can be highly visible and troubling. They may often lead to itching, pain, covered patches of skin, and even changes in looks. For some people, these scars can affect their daily lives, causing both physical discomfort and emotional distress. One commonly used treatment for these raised scars is Silicone Gel Sheeting (SGS), made from a special kind of medical silicone. Our study aimed to see how effective SGS is in treating these raised scars in different care settings.

Trial Design:
Our study included randomised trials from around the world. These trials involved people who had raised scars and were treated with SGS. We gathered data from thirteen studies in total, with a number of people in each study ranging from 10 to 60 making a total of 177 participants. The scars came from different parts of the body, and the follow-up times for the patients after the treatment varied between the studies. We collected and analysed data to get a clear idea of how SGS treatment worked compared to other treatments or no treatment at all. This analysis took a couple of weeks.

Results:
The main result from our study is that there is currently limited solid evidence about the effectiveness of SGS in treating raised scars. There were seven studies comparing SGS with no treatment, and the difference between the severity of the scars after treatment was uncertain. SGS might slightly reduce pain compared to having no treatment at all, but it's unclear if SGS affects the severity of the scars when compared with other treatments.

When SGS was compared with other treatments like pressure garments, silicone gel, onion extract, polyurethane, propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting, and Gecko Nanoplast, the only observation was that SGS may slightly reduce the severity of scarring compared with onion extract. It was still unclear if SGS impacted the severity of the scars or reduced pain compared with all the other treatments.

More studies about this treatment are suggested as we need to reduce any uncertainty around making a decision about using SGS to treat raised scars. It's important to note that most of the trials didn't provide any evidence of scarring severity rated by patients themselves, their quality of life relating to health, or the cost effectiveness of the treatment. Also, the risk of bias was unclear due to poorly-reported methodology across the trials. Therefore, more rigorous research is also needed in this area.
