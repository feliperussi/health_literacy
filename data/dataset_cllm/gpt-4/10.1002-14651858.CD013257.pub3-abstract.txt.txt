1. Plain Title: Testing Different Cancer Drugs on Advanced Lung Cancer Patients

2. Rationale: Lung cancer is a major health problem globally and it's our aim to find the best possible treatment. The common form of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often requires a blend of therapies. One group of drugs we're studying are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These work by guiding the immune system to attack cancer cells. Some ICIs, like pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, have shown promising results, yet it's not clear which type of treatment is best for each patient. The study aimed to understand if ICIs, used alone or with other drugs, are a safe and effective first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, particularly looking at how a patient's level of PD-L1 expression (a protein that can be overexpressed in cancer patients) impacts the results. 

3. Trial Design: Our team reviewed existing data on patients 18 years old and above with stage IV NSCLC, who had not received cancer treatment before. We were specifically interested in trials that compared treatments using one or two ICIs versus traditional chemotherapy drugs. We searched from all available data up until the end of 2020 and included information from 15 different trials that involved 5893 participants. Measuring the results hinged on overall survival, length of time without the disease progressing and health-related quality of life.

4. Results: Our analysis found that for patients with high levels of PD-L1 (over 50%), using a single ICI drug probably increased survival compared to traditional chemotherapy. These patients also possibly experienced a longer time without disease progression and a better quality of life. Additionally, severe side effects seemed to be less frequent with this type of ICI treatment. Using two ICI drugs also likely extended patient survival, but we need more data to understand its impact on disease progression, quality of life and possible side effects. In conclusion, our research suggests that ICIs can offer better results than traditional chemotherapy for some people with advanced NSCLC, depending on individual patient characteristics.
