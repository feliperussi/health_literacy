1. Plain Title: Studying Different Medicines for Treating Delirium in Severely Sick Adults

2. Rationale: Delirium is a serious sudden disturbance in mental abilities often seen in severely ill patients. It results in confusion and decreased awareness of the environment. Despite its temporary nature, delirium can have severe impact on a patient's short-term and long-term health. It is crucial to find effective treatments to reduce the length of delirium and its negative impact. Currently, there's a lot of uncertainty about what type of drug treatments work best for delirium. This study was designed to compare different medicines for treating delirium in critically ill adults and to see which ones are both effective and safe.

3. Trial Design: This study collected and reviewed information from a lot of earlier trials that were done worldwide. The study only considered trials that were random, which means the treatments were assigned by chance, like flipping a coin. All these trials used different medications to treat delirium in very sick adults who were in Intensive Care Units (ICU) of different hospitals. The focus was mainly on the effect of these medications on the length of delirium, but other factors like relapses, length of hospital stay, long-term health changes after ICU discharge, and possible side-effects were also considered.

4. Results: Out of 7674 trials reviewed, 14 trials with 1844 participants met the standards for this study. These trials tested different medications such as antipsychotics, alpha2 agonists (specifically dexmedetomidine), statins, opioids (specifically morphine), serotonin antagonists (specifically ondansetron), and cholinesterase inhibitors (specifically rivastigmine). The results showed that the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine performed best. It appeared to shorten delirium and the need for mechanical breathing support. However, the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to increase the length of ICU stay. It's important to note that while all these data were pooled together and analyzed, different trials had different levels of quality control and so the conclusions are still uncertain. 

In conclusion, this study brought together data from a wide range of previous trials, comparing a variety of medications used for treating delirium in critically ill patients. Although it gave some indications about possibly helpful medicines, the evidence is not solid enough yet to be sure about what works best. Future trials, which are still ongoing or expected, may provide more reliable answers.
