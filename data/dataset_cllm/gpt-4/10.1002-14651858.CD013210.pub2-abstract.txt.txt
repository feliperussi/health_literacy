Title: Searching for the Most Effective Treatment to Limit Recurrence of Gut Inflammation After Surgery

Why is this Study Important?
Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the gut. Around 75% of people suffering from this disease will need at least one surgery in their life to help manage the symptoms. However, the disease often comes back even after surgery, so patients need to use certain medicines to maintain the effects of their surgery and keep the inflammation in control. Right now, scientists and doctors aren't sure which medicine works best to maintain the positive effects of surgery for a longer period of time. This study was done to understand which treatment works the best and to create a list according to their effectiveness.

How Did We Do the Research?
We used previous research studies to collect our information. We included results from studies that used different medicines given to patients for at least three months after surgery. We excluded results from studies that used food based treatments, herbal medicine, or diet supplements. Two team members separately chose suitable studies, pulled out information needed and then evaluated it. If there was disagreement, a third member was brought in to discuss. We used a special method of analysis to figure out which treatment came out on top. We focused on three major outcomes: recurrence of disease symptoms, recurrence of inflammation under a microscope, and patients having to stop taking a medicine due to side effects. 

What Did We Find?
We looked at 35 previous studies that included a total of 3249 participants. The participants fell in the age range of 33.6 to 38.8 years. The treatments studied were several different medicines including antibiotics, a gut specific steroid, and a mix of a specific diabetes medicine and a steroid. We ranked these treatments based on effectiveness and how sure we were about each treatment. The five top ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5-ASA, and purine analogues. Adalimumab and 5-ASA seemed to be more effective in reducing the risk of disease symptoms coming back compared to a placebo (a dummy pill), however, we werenâ€™t entirely sure about the effects of the other medicines. 

Unfortunately, due to high risk of bias and limited data, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of the medicines on other outcomes such as inflammation under a microscope or the side effects causing withdrawal. In the case of side effects, withdrawal seemed least likely with sulfasalazine and most likely with antibiotics. Two side effects leading to withdrawal, pancreatitis and leukopenia (reduction in white blood cells), happened more frequently in patients treated with purine analogues compared to other groups.

In Conclusion
We weren't able to come to concrete conclusions about which treatment is the best for preventing the disease symptoms or inflammation under a microscope from coming back due to low certainty in available data. There were some side effects linked with treatments, including pancreatitis and leukopenia with purine analogues, based on the studies we looked at. More large-scale studies are needed to further understand the effect of these treatments on disease recurrence after surgery.
