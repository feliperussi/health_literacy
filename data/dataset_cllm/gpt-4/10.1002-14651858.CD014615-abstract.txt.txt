1. Plain Title: 
The Impact of Mothers’ Positioning on Birth When Baby is Positioned Poorly 

2. Rationale: 
During childbirth, a baby positioned in a certain way, such as facing the mommy's belly, could lead to more complicated labor and affect both the mother and the baby's well-being. Doctors have thought that changing the mother’s position during labor might help improve the baby's position and make labor easier. So, the study was done to see how the mother's body position might affect difficult labor due to poor baby positioning. 

3. Trial Design: 
In this study, the researchers looked at eight different studies, including 1766 mothers whose babies were in a difficult position for birth. They compared the results of mothers who took certain body positions when giving birth, to those who took other positions. They especially wanted to know if two common positions, “hands-and-knees” and lying on one side ("lateral"), were helpful or not.

4. Results: 
The studies involved didn't provide clear evidence that the "hands-and-knees" position or the side-lying position made a big difference in labor outcomes. They didn't significantly affect the need for surgical delivery (c-section), the need for tools to help the baby out (forceps or vacuum), or the overall happiness of the mother after birth. Also, they did not seem to reduce the chances of tears to the mother's body, bleeding after giving birth, or baby's need for intensive care.

The researchers pointed out, though, that if a mother finds these positions comfortable, there's no reason why she shouldn't use them. They also pointed out that more research is needed to know for sure if these positions, or others, can help when the baby is in a difficult position. They suggested that future studies might also want to look at other positions or at using these positions earlier in labor.
