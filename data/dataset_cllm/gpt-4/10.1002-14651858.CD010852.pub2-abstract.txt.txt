1. Plain Title: 
Understanding the Role of Hypnosis in Inducing Labour 

2. Rationale: 
Labour induction sometimes requires the use of drugs or other methods that may increase the risk of complications for the mother and baby. This is why alternative, safer options are being searched. Hypnosis is one such method that could potentially be used to induce labour safely. However, the effectiveness of hypnosis for this purpose is not fully known and is the reason for conducting this study. 

3. Trial Design: 
In this study, we looked for-high quality, randomized controlled trials, where pregnant women were randomly put into different groups to receive either hypnosis or some other intervention, or no intervention at all. Our primary goal was to see if labour was induced among these women. We searched widely for such trials through January 31, 2014. Additionally, we also reviewed conference proceedings and contacted experts in the field for any published and unpublished references connected to our study. 

4. Results: 
Unfortunately, we found no such trials through our extensive search strategy. In other words, we did not find any evidence from randomized trials to help us understand the effect of hypnosis on inducing labour. Therefore, we cannot definitively say how effective and safe hypnosis is for this purpose. Until we have such evidence, use of hypnosis for inducing labour should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Future studies should aim to examine the effectiveness and safety of hypnosis for labour induction, particularly among pregnant women experiencing a certain level of anxiety. The duration and timing of the hypnosis, and necessary training of the staff, are considerations for future trials. It would also be beneficial to gather the thoughts and experiences of women and staff participating in these trials.
