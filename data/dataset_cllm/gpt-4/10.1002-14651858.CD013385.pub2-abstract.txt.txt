1. Plain Title: Understanding the Role of Healthcare Provider Support in Patient Decision-Making

2. Rationale: Making health-related decisions can be difficult, sometimes requiring understanding of complex medical information. These decisions may be about choosing treatments, or deciding whether to go through a certain kind of health test. To help with this, some health workers like doctors and nurses offer support known as decision coaching. This is when they help patients explore the options and come to a decision, but do not tell them what to choose. Despite the potential benefits, we don't know much about how effective decision coaching really is. This study was done to see if decision coaching can help patients feel prepared and confident about their health choices, improve their knowledge, and help avoid negative feelings such as regret or anxiety after the decision is made. 

3. Trial Design: We looked at a large number of studies on this topic, from when the databases were set up to June 2021. We selected these studies following a process. We only included experiments where the support was provided to adults or children who were getting ready to make a health decision for themselves or their family members. The support had to be provided by a trained healthcare worker and it had to help patients be part of a healthcare decision. We collected data from these studies, analyzed it, and drew conclusions. 

4. Results: We screened almost 13,000 studies and included 28 that fit our criteria. These studies looked at 5509 adult participants who were facing different types of health decisions. We found that when decision coaching was combined with educational information about the decision, patients did tend to have more knowledge about their health choices. However, it wasn't clear if decision coaching improves other outcomes like preparation for decision-making, confidence, feelings of being uninformed, unclear about what they value, feeling unsupported, regretting their decision or feeling anxious. The results suggest that decision coaching may be helpful especially when it's combined with information about the decision, but we still need more research to figure out its effectiveness for a broader range of outcomes. Importantly, we didn't see any major negative effects of decision coaching, such as increased regret or anxiety.
