Plain Title: 
A Study to Understand If Blood Thinning Medication Helps People with Minor Blood Clots in the Lungs

Rationale:
Lung blood clots, known as Pulmonary Embolisms (PEs), are dangerous and cause many deaths per year. Sometimes these blood clots are major and can be found in large lung arteries, other times they are minor and found in smaller, outside lung arteries. This smaller type of lung clot is known as 'subsegmental pulmonary embolism' (SSPE). Itâ€™s been noticed that these smaller clots are often seen in people who don't have usual blood clot symptoms, like coughing blood or chest pain. Some even occur incidentally or by chance in patients being screened for other conditions. Traditionally all lung clots, big and small, are treated with blood thinning medicine. Research indicates that blood thinners might not be as helpful for smaller clots. They could even cause side effects due to unnecessary use. With this study, we want to understand if blood thinners can be safely and effectively used in patients with smaller types of lung clots.

Trial Design:
We looked for trials that compared the use of blood thinning medication to no medication in patients with minor lung blood clots. We searched multiple health research databases, checked references, and inspected all citations to find the right studies. We planned to have two of our experts separately review and assess the quality of these studies.

Results:
After all the searching and reviewing, we didn't find any studies that met our needs. We can't draw any conclusions on whether blood thinning medication is effective and safe for minor lung blood clots. This means we need well-done research to help make clear decisions about using blood thinners for these small clots.
