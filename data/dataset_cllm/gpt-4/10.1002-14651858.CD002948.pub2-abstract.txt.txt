1. Plain Title: 
Herbal Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis

2. Rationale:
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful condition where the body's immune system attacks the joints. This can lead to stiffness, swelling, and long-term joint damage. It can make simple activities like walking or holding a cup very difficult. Some herbal medicines might help reduce these symptoms. This study was designed to review previous trials on the effectiveness of herbal therapies in treating RA. The hope was that these natural remedies could help manage the pain and disability caused by this chronic disease.

3. Trial Design:
This study is called a systematic review, which means it collected and examined information from various scientific studies. The research team looked at controlled trials, where some people with RA were given an herbal treatment and others were given a placebo or a standard treatment. They searched many different databases in October 2010, and did not limit their search by language. The studies could be from anywhere in the world and had to involve people suffering from RA. The researchers focused on understanding if the herbal treatments provided any benefits.

4. Results:
From all the information they collected, 22 studies seemed relevant for the review. Seven reports suggested that Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) found in oils from the evening primrose flower, borage seeds, or blackcurrant seeds might help. People who took GLA showed less pain and better physical ability than those who didn't. A few more people in the GLA group reported side effects, but the increase wasn't significant statistically.

Another herbal medicine called Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as the thunder god vine, showed some promise in three studies. But, the researchers could not combine the results due to the studies being too different. In one study, some people experienced severe side effects from taking this herb orally. Although, in the follow-up studies, side effects were mild to moderate and stopped once the treatment ended. 

However, evidence for a herbal product named Phytodolor was less convincing due to poor reporting in the studies. The other studies each looked at different herbal treatments, and overall, they found that many had research flaws or missed key information. 

In the end, the review concluded that while some herbal treatments seemed to help, the evidence isn't strong enough yet. More careful, well-planned trials are needed. Particularly, future trials need to follow established guidelines to better understand the effects of these herbal remedies on RA symptoms.
