1. Plain Title: Checking Methods for Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccination

2. Rationale: The COVID-19 virus can cause severe illnesses, disabilities, or even death. Vaccines can prevent the worst symptoms and help protect those who haven't been vaccinated yet. They could even help prevent new strains or mutations of the virus. However, some people are hesitant to get vaccinated, which affects the health of entire communities. This is why we conducted a research study to find ways to encourage more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

3. Trial Design: To find methods that encourage COVID-19 vaccinations, our study involved checking existing studies until October 11, 2021. We considered research that offered ways to make people more willing to be vaccinated, increase vaccine use, or reduce vaccine hesitancy. Our study didn't limit type of research - we included both trials and observational studies as long as they had over a hundred participants. The interventions we studied included methods using communication, policy changes, education, incentives, improved access, and combined approaches. The studies were also divided by population targeted and whether they used a random trial method or not. 

4. Results: Our review included 96 different studies - 61 with results already published and 35 still ongoing. Most of the completed and ongoing studies were conducted in English-speaking, wealthy countries. Most methods tested were communication strategies to encourage vaccination. These studies addressed a wide array of people, including healthcare workers, students, minority groups in the US, at-risk patients, and the general public. 

We've confirmed that lots of research is being done to find ways to increase vaccine use and decrease hesitancy. However, we've noticed that there is a lack of studies in less wealthy countries and on policies and improved access. We've also seen fewer efforts targeted towards children and teens. As vaccines become more available, it's crucial that these groups and methods are not left out of further research.
