1. Plain Title: A Study Comparing Different Treatments for Constant Sinus Issues in People with Cystic Fibrosis 

2. Rationale: Sinus problems that last for a long time are common in people who have a serious genetic disorder called cystic fibrosis. There are many treatment options for these ongoing sinus issues, such as different types of saltwater nose rinses, steroids taken by mouth or applied directly in the nose, antibiotic medicines including the ones taken as a fine mist (nebulizer), and other types of medicines like lumacaftor, ivacaftor or tezacaftor which help to correct how the faulty gene behaves in people with cystic fibrosis. But we are not sure how well these treatments work. Going through all these treatment options to find out the best one is the main reason for our research.

3. Trial Design: This study was designed to compare different treatment options for long-term sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. We planned to look for the studies that tested these treatments against each other, or the ones that don't give any treatment or give a placebo (a medicine with no active ingredients). We looked for these studies in medical databases, registers of clinical trials, and also in related articles and conference materials. The process of selecting studies for including in our review was done by two of our team members, and any data collected and analyzed would follow well-established methods. 

4. Results: Unfortunately, we did not find any studies that met our criteria or could be included in our review. Even though we found 44 new references during our recent searches, none of these studies were fit for our review, and one study is still ongoing. So, based on this review, we can't say anything conclusive about the best treatment for constant sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. This shows there is a need for good quality studies that compare different treatment options for managing these sinus issues. These studies can aid to prevent lung worsening and improve the quality of life for people living with cystic fibrosis.
