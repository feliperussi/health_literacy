1. Plain Title: 
Studying the Effect of Using Cold Treatment Versus Normal Surgery for Liver Cancer

2. Rationale:
Generally, there are two major kinds of malignant tumors affecting the liver - primary liver tumors and the liver metastases from colorectal cancer, with the latter being more prevalent. Unfortunately, total surgical removal, which offers the best chance of long-term survival, cannot be performed on most patients. This study aims to assess the effects of a technique called cryotherapy, or cold treatment, against these liver metastases. Cryotherapy involves the use of a special tool directed by imaging and it releases super-cold liquid nitrogen or argon gas directly to the tumor. The ensuing freezing process forms ice crystals that directly damage the cells of the tumor, including the cancer cells.

3. Trial Design:
In the search for trials that tested cryotherapy on liver metastases, we looked into multiple high-quality databases up until June 2018. We only took into account randomized clinical trials, where the harmful and beneficial effects of cryotherapy were compared with other treatments for liver metastases, disregarding where the primary tumor was located. We collected details pertaining to each trialâ€™s outcomes, potential biases, and methodologies. We found one trial, conducted in Ukraine, involving 123 participants with liver metastases. The trial compared cryotherapy and conventional surgery.

4. Results:
This particular trial provided limited details and had some risk of bias, thus warranting a low level of certainty towards evidence. At the end of a 10-year follow-up, we found that 81% of the participants from the cryotherapy group had passed away, compared to 92% of the participants that underwent conventional surgery. It also appeared that the recurrence of cancer in the liver was slightly lower in the cryotherapy group compared to the surgery group. However, both groups experienced similar frequencies of complications post-procedure, except for postoperative pain which was more common in the cryotherapy group. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any data related to the progression of liver metastases, cancer mortality, or health-related quality of life. As such, we remain unsure whether cryotherapy is beneficial or harmful when compared to traditional surgery. There's a need for more studies and evidence to better understand the real benefits or harms of cryotherapy against other treatments or no treatment at all.
