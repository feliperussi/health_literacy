Understanding the Effect of Emotional and Social Support on Tiredness in Adults with Untreatable Cancer

2. Rationale
Sometimes patients with cancer that cannot be cured feel extremely tired, especially when they are undergoing treatment to ease their symptoms. This loss of energy, called fatigue, can make it hard to enjoy life and carry out daily tasks. There is an idea that giving emotional and social support could help manage this fatigue, making life easier for these patients. This includes things like talking therapies, education or relaxation techniques, and social activities. The study set out to learn if these types of support really do help lessen fatigue in adult patients with untreatable cancer who are receiving treatment for symptom relief.

3. Trial Design
The research team looked at studies from multiple databases and registries up until November 29, 2016, to gather information. They were specifically interested in studies that tried out emotional and social support methods – like interacting, learning, or changing behaviours – to see if these lessened fatigue in adults with untreatable cancer. The patients were all 18 years and older and received treatment to ease symptoms. The researchers looked only at studies where patients had at least two visits with a caregiver who gave feedback about any changes from the support. The information gathered was carefully reviewed and analyzed by two authors independently, who also assessed the quality of the studies using a system called GRADE.

4. Results
A total of 14 studies, reporting on 3077 randomized patients, were chosen for this review. However, the analysis focused on a smaller group of 535 patients who were all living with untreatable cancer and receiving symptom-easing treatments. These studies offered a wide range of emotional and social support, and the results were different too. There was a hint of benefit at the first follow-up, but this did not last in the next round of follow-up. Sadly, overall, this support did not seem to lessen fatigue right after the support ended, nor in the period that followed, nor did it improve other aspects of the patients’ lives, like physical, social, role, emotional or cognitive functioning. The researchers were able to obtain data from only three studies comparing patients who received the support and those who did not, and no real differences were noticed in side-effects. The overall quality of information gathered was rated low, so the findings may not be very reliable. The authors concluded that right now, there isn't enough evidence to recommend emotional and social support methods for lessening fatigue in adults with untreatable cancer. More studies, involving more patients, are needed to really understand if emotional and social support can help manage fatigue.
