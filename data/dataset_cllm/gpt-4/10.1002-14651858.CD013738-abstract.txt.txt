Plain Title: 
The Quest for Research on Preventing Suicides on Roads

Rationale: 
Deaths from suicide by traffic are more prevalent than we might think. Unfortunately, it's challenging to draw a clear line between accidents and intentional suicides, so we don't have official numbers. One crucial way to prevent suicides is by making it harder to access the means of committing suicide. This strategy has proven successful in numerous cases. However, when it comes to preventing suicide on roads, we don't have strong evidence of what works. For this reason, we conducted a study to understand better how cutting off access to suicide options on roads can be effective.

Trial Design: 
Ours was a comprehensive investigation. We looked into several online libraries and databases with information from the start of their record until March 2020. We didn't limit our search by date, publication type, or language. We focused on studies of different types that evaluated initiatives to prevent suicidal behavior involving vehicles on roads. Our team of two reviewers sifted through the abstracts and full text to see if these studies met our criteria. Sadly, we didn't find any studies that did.

Results: 
Our review didn't find any study which looked into how restricting access to suicide channels on roads can be effective. This comes as a surprise considering the severity of the issue of suicides on roads. We feel there's an urgent need for solid, detailed research to understand how to prevent suicides on roads effectively. Getting accurate numbers relating to suicides on roads is crucial for research efforts, thus calling for clear, unambiguous criteria for this kind of study. Currently, we don't have enough evidence to draw conclusions for prevention plans, so we highly recommend better awareness around road traffic suicides and including it in government suicide prevention policies. Furthermore, we urge scientists to explore strategies that donâ€™t need driver cooperation and can prevent suicides on roads effectively.
