1. Plain Title: 
Understanding the Effects of Early Fixing of Blood Vessel Problems in Patients Undergoing Dialysis

2. Rationale: 
For patients undergoing dialysis, there are possible issues that can occur with the blood vessels (arteriovenous or AV) used for the procedure, specifically, a narrowing of these vessels, called a stenosis. Doctors use physical exams and technology to spot these issues early and fix them before they cause bigger problems. However, it's not certain whether fixing these issues early (pre-emptively) is better than waiting until they start causing problems (deferred correction). This study was conducted to understand whether it really benefits the patients if we fix these issues before they start causing problems or not.

3. Trial Design: 
We looked at past research studies conducted up until November 2015. The studies we included originally focused on early spotting and fixing of vessel narrowings. We wanted to see if there were differences based on the type of vessel used, the type of checkup used rather it was Doppler ultrasound or flow measurement, and several other factors. We also collected data on issues that could possibly be fixed, issues that possibly couldnâ€™t be fixed, infections and death, and how much the medical procedures cost.

4. Results: 
Our look into these studies showed some interesting results. We found that fixing these vessel issues before they start causing problems lessened the chance of complications and even increased the life-span of the vessels used for dialysis. However, this only seemed to be the case for certain types of vessels called fistulas and not so much for another type called grafts. We also saw that this pre-emptive fixing might even lead to lesser hospitalizations and use of medical tubes for other needs. However, it could also increase the number of diagnostic procedures, chances of getting an infection, and even death. Given all this, we say that although early fixing of these vessel issues might seem beneficial for some patients, specifically those using fistulas, there isn't enough strong proof for it to be a firm recommendation. The benefit of reduced hospitalization is still uncertain, and the possibility of increased procedures and related risks is real. We need to keep studying and understanding the effects of this pre-emptive fixing to make sure it's really beneficial for patients undergoing dialysis.
