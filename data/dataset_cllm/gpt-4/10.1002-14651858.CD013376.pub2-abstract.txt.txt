1. Plain Title: 
Educating Farmers on Better Farming Practices Could Reduce Aflatoxin Exposure and Improve Children's Growth

2. Rationale:
Aflatoxins, harmful toxins that can be found in foods like maize and groundnuts, contaminate many of the foods we eat. This contamination is more common in countries where people don't earn a lot of money. These toxins are harmful to everyone, but they're especially dangerous for pregnant women and young children. Some studies suggest that, during pregnancy and early childhood, eating foods with aflatoxins might stunt a child's growth. There's a need to come up with ways to reduce our exposure to aflatoxins, particularly in low-income countries. This study aimed to see if teaching farmers safer farming methods can help reduce exposure to aflatoxins and improve children’s growth.

3. Trial Design:
The study, which took place in July and August of 2019, involved young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women from rural, farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. The researchers taught some farmers improved methods for handling their crops after harvest to reduce aflatoxin contamination. The effects of this teaching was compared with those farms that didn't receive this education. Specifically, they looked at babies' and children’s growth patterns, along with other health issues, over a period of five to nine months. 

4. Results:
The study involved three trials, in which farmers were taught better ways of handling their crops after harvest. The researchers found that in one trial from Tanzania, infants whose parents received this education had improved growth rates compared to those who didn't. Specifically, the infants' weights showed an average increase by 0.57 when compared to babies whose parents received regular farming instructions. This means that fewer babies were underweight in the households where the farmers got the special training. 

However, the overall results of these trials are not definite due to the high risk of people dropping out of the study. Unfortunately, no studies reported the effects of nutrition education on how babies and children grow before and after birth. Therefore, while the preliminary findings suggest that educating farmers about how to reduce aflatoxin exposure can improve children's growth, more research is needed. 

In conclusion, the few studies available suggest that changes in farming practices can lead to less exposure to the harmful aflatoxins and help children grow better. But, more research is needed to confirm these results.
