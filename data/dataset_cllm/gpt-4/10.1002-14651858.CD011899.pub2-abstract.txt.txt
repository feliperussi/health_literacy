1. Plain Title: 
Comparison Study: Online and In-Person Stress Control Methods for Workers

2. Rationale:
Everyone faces stress, but constant stress can lead to many health problems. For workers, stress can lower their performance and raise health insurance costs. There are methods to help control stress, like in-person classes or online programs. Both these classes and programs have been shown to lower stress in workers. Even so, it is not clear yet if one method is better than the other. This study was conducted to understand if online programs for stress control are just as good, if not better, than in-person classes, considering online methods could be more easy to use, time-saving, and cost-effective.

3. Trial Design:
To find out which kind of stress control method is more effective, a study was conducted. Various databases were searched until February 2017 to collect relevant studies. The focus was on studies that included a controlled test comparing the success of an online stress control method to an in-person class with the same content. The measurement of success was the degree to which stress or burnout was reduced. Workers from any job type could be participants. After screening and reviewing 3431 studies from the search, 75 were found potentially significant and were looked at in great detail. Merely two studies meant all the criteria, and these were included in this study.

4. Results:
The two studies included a total of 159 participants, with 67 doing online programs and 92 attending in-person classes. On average, participants were middle-aged, white, and had college education. Both studies tested stress levels less than a month after the stress control method was performed. However, because the two studies had very different outcomes, their data could not be combined and were studied individually. One study found that stress levels among those attending online programs were higher than those attending in-person classes, while the other reported lower stress levels in the online program group. Unfortunately, both these studies had a high risk of bias, or unfair influence. This led to the conclusion that there is very low confidence in the data collected. Also, the two studies had very few participants, which could affect the results. Therefore, more studies done in the future are very likely to provide different conclusions.
