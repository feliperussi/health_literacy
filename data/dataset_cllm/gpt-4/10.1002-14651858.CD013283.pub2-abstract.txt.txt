1. Plain Title: 
First Aid Treatment for Low Blood Sugar: Which is the Best Way to Give Sugar?

2. Rationale:
Having low blood sugar, or hypoglycaemia, is a common issue for people with diabetes. However, it can also occur in individuals who don't have diabetes due to an imbalance in the body's sugar levels. Understanding the quickest and most effective way to administer sugar in a first-aid situation when someone has low blood sugar can help to alleviate symptoms and avoid complications. This study explored different methods (mouth, under the tongue, or rectally) of giving sugar to someone experiencing low blood sugar. 

3. Trial Design:
This study analyzed data from a variety of sources, like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL and others, up until July 2018. It reviewed studies including both adults and children with real or suspected low blood sugar, as well as healthy people. Different methods of sugar administration suitable for first-aid situations were examined. Two of the authors independently chose the studies, evaluated them for bias, and extracted data. A small amount of studies matched the required criteria. 

4. Results:
A total of four studies with 77 volunteers were included. These studies examined three ways of giving sugar: buccal (in the cheek), sublingual (under the tongue), and a combo of oral (by mouth) and buccal.

One study found that putting table sugar under the tongue in children with low blood sugar and a cold or malaria, led to higher blood sugar levels after 20 minutes compared to swallowing it. After 80 minutes, the low blood sugar was more likely to be resolved if the sugar was placed under the tongue. No harmful effects were noticed in either group.

One study noted lower blood sugar after 20 minutes when sugar was placed in the cheek compared to swallowing it. In another study, fewer people had increased blood sugar at 20 minutes when the sugar was swallowed.

When a sweet gel was used both in the mouth and on the cheek lining, no better results were observed in terms of symptom resolution within 20 minutes of either method.

However, because of the small number of studies and participants, and some issues with the study methods, the result should be viewed with caution. Further investigation is necessary. As for now, swallowing sugar seems to be the quickest way to treat low blood sugar in a first-aid situation, especially when compared to placing sugar in the cheek.
