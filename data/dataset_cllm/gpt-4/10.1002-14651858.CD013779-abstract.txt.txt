1. Plain Title: Ways to Protect the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers During Disease Outbreaks

2. Rationale: Healthcare workers who help manage disease outbreaks often face a higher risk of mental health problems. These problems can range from feelings of depression, stress, and anxiety to difficulties in thinking and interacting with others. It can also impact their performance at work. The World Health Organization (WHO) has concerned about the effect of diseases like COVID-19 on the mental health of these frontline workers. This study was done to find ways to support and improve the mental health and resilience (or their ability to handle stress) of health and social care workers during a disease outbreak.

3. Trial Design: The study explored options for taking care of the mental well-being of healthcare workers who work at the forefront during serious disease outbreaks, such as epidemics or pandemics, from 2002 onwards. These options may include changing the workplace arrangements, addressing daily needs, providing emotional support, or medical treatment. The study also looked at the possible roadblocks and helpful elements in carrying out these supports. The study included scientific reviews, medical databases, ongoing trial registers, and other information sources for data collection.

4. Results: The study reviewed 16 cases where a program was used to support the mental health of frontline caregivers during illnesses such as severe breathing syndromes, Ebola, and COVID-19. These programs looked at several options, including workplace changes and emotional support. The results showed that two roadblocks, in particular, stood out. The first was that healthcare workers or their organizations weren't fully aware of what's needed to support their mental health. Second, there was often a lack of tools, time, or skills needed to carry out the supporting program. The study did find that three elements were helpful: programs that can be changed to fit local needs, effective communication, and positive, safe, and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. Overall, the study suggested that more research is needed to determine what helps effectively and that several factors such as organizational, social, personal, and psychological should be considered while planning support for frontline health workers.
