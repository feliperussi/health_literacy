1. Plain Title:
Testing Bone Strengthening Drugs for Fragile Bone Disease

2. Rationale:
Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or what we often term as "Fragile Bone Disease", is a genetic condition where people have soft, breakable bones due to an abnormal type of protein in their bones. Even simple tasks can cause their bones to fracture. Some drugs, called Bisphosphonates, are usually given to these people in hopes to make their bones stronger and less likely to fracture. However, the previous understanding of how effective these drugs are needs to be updated. This study was done to find out how effective and safe bisphosphonates are in making the bones stronger, reducing fractures, and improving their daily functioning.

3. Trial Design:
To find accurate results, we reviewed trials which compared people taking bisphosphonates to those taking dummy drugs or no drugs at all. The trials included randomly selected people with any type of fragile bone disease. We did not limit our review to any specific age group or health condition of the patients. We looked at a number of well-known databases and records until April 2016 to find these trials, making sure we did not miss any relevant findings. Two authors separately reviewed and analyzed the collected data to remove any biases.

4. Results:
We found 14 trials with 819 participants in total. Two trials reported that oral bisphosphonates reduced the risk and number of fractures. The rest did not find any significant difference. Five trials reported that these drugs indeed increased bone strength, at least for one time point studied. For intravenous bisphosphonates, two trials showed that these drugs did not significantly reduce the number of patients with at least one fracture. For bone strength, one trial showed a significant improvement at six and 12 months after intravenous treatment, while two trials did not report any valuable difference. The study results about growth, bone pain, and functional outcomes were incomplete and did not consistently show improvements, regardless of oral or intravenous therapy. No differences were found between different doses of the drug or between oral and intravenous therapy. Two studies considered two types of intravenous drugs. Neither showed significant differences in the main outcome, but they disagreed about the relative benefit of one drug over the other for bone strength at 12 months.

From what we found, individuals with fragile bone disease commonly use Bisphosphonates. There is some evidence showing that these drugs increase bone strength in children and adults with fragile bone disease. However, it is unclear whether these treatments consistently reduce fractures, as the results varied among the studies reviewed and no study reported an increase in fractures. Additionally, it is also uncertain whether these drugs improve their state (reduce pain, improve growth and daily activities). There is a need for more studies to find the best method and duration for this treatment, and more importantly, to find out about the long-term safety of this therapy. Particular attention should be given to reducing fractures long-term and improving the quality of life of these people.
