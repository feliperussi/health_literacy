Plain Title: 
Studying Different Ways to Help Newborns Breathe on Their Own After Using a Breathing Machine

Rationale:
Sometimes, newborn babies can get really sick and they may have trouble breathing. When this happens, they are placed in a special care department in the hospital called the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Often, these babies need help breathing, and they are given that help through a machine called a ventilator. Although ventilators are very important and can save lives, they can sometimes cause problems for the babies. This is why doctors want to help babies to start breathing on their own as soon as possible. This process is called weaning.

In this study, we wanted to find out if following a strict set of steps (protocol) was better in helping babies breathe on their own sooner, without any problems. We also wanted to see if it helped them get out of the hospital sooner. We hoped to find out if following a plan was safe and better than not having a specific plan.

Trial Design:
To figure this out, we had to find studies that compared babies who were helped off the ventilator using a protocol to those who were not. We included babies born after 24 weeks of pregnancy and who were in the study within 28 days of their expected birth date. 

We searched in different places for studies published till July 2015, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science. We did not limit our search by the language of the study. We also asked experts in the field and authors of studies for their help. 

Results:
We found 1752 studies. First, we took out the duplicates (1062) and not related studies (843). Then, we did not find any suitable studies on helping newborn babies off ventilators. Two studies seemed useful, but they did not have enough information specifically about newborns. Therefore, we couldn't use them for our study.

From this review, we can't say for sure if following a strict plan is better than not when helping newborn babies off ventilators. We need more studies to find out.
