Plain Title: 
Exploring Ways to Improve Coughing in People with Chronic Muscle Disorders

Rationale: 
Neuromuscular disorders are illnesses that weaken your muscles, making it harder for you to move or perform daily tasks. These conditions often make it tough for people to cough effectively, leading to problems such as mucus build-up and breathing issues. These problems may cause more severe health issues that require hospital care, and also negatively affect the person's quality of life. This study aimed to help such individuals by improving their ability to cough. Researchers wished to find out if techniques to enhance coughing might lessen respiratory problems, cut down hospital visits, and increase overall quality of life.

Trial Design:
Researchers scanned records from several medical databases and clinical trial registries in April 2020 for studies comparing the effect of cough improvement techniques versus no treatment or other methods in adults and children with chronic muscle disorders. The study included 11 research studies with a total of 287 people, aged from three to 73 years. The main goal was finding out if these cough improving techniques reduced the number and length of unplanned hospital stays due to severe respiratory problems.

Results:
The individual studies looked at a variety of cough improvement methods, testing each one against a normal cough, other methods, or fake treatments. However, none of them provided information on our main goal of reducing unplanned hospital visits and did not list any negative effects from the treatments. The collected data does hint that these methods might help improve the power of a cough compared to a natural cough. However, the evidence is not very strong, and the different methods seem to work about the same. There's not enough information to say for sure if these methods improve breathing, lung function, quality of life, daily function, or patient satisfaction. Overall, we're still uncertain if these cough improvement methods are safe and effective for adults and children with chronic muscle conditions, and more research is needed.
