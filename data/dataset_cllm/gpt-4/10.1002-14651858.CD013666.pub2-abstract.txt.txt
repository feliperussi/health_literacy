1. Plain Title: Reviewing Short-Term Breathing Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis

2. Rationale: 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a condition causing grief for many due to its effect on the body's ability to breathe. In particular, it's the lung problems that cause the most health issues and, sadly, can even lead to death. To treat these lung problems and improve the person's ability to breathe, medicines called bronchodilators are often used. These drugs are mostly inhaled and they help in relieving the feeling of breathlessness, by helping airways open up for mucus to be cleared. However, although many people are using these treatments, it's not fully proven how well they work. Thatâ€™s why in this study, we looked closely to understand better how these treatments work for CF patients, especially the ones acting for a short time.

3. Trial Design:
Our study looked at data from previously conducted research, specifically those that examined how short-term inhaled bronchodilators treat CF patients. These are medicines delivered directly into the lungs through different types of devices, such as little cans of spray or powder contraptions, or machines that create a mist to breathe in. We searched databases, trial registries, and reviewed articles until April 12, 2022. The main thing we wanted from these studies was to know whether the bronchodilators were successful in improving patient outcomes and were safe. Every study that we considered had to compare either one type of bronchodilator to a placebo treatment, or one type of bronchodilator to another. It didn't matter how often the medicine was used, how long the treatment lasted, or how it was administered - as long as it made a comparison, we considered it.

4. Results:
We found 11 trials that fit our criteria and involved 191 participants. Most trials focused on outcomes taken very soon after the drug was given. There were eight trials that compared a short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists (a particular type of bronchodilator) to a sugary-water substitute or placebo. Another four trials compared short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists (another type of bronchodilator) to placebo. and three trials compared the two types of real bronchodilators to each other. 

From the trials that compared short-acting beta-2 agonists to placebo, we found two trials that reported a small but notable improvement in the amount of air that could be blown out in one second (a common test of lung function) after bronchodilator use compared to placebo.  Other few trials reported mild side effects. As for the comparison between short-acting muscarinic antagonists and placebo, all four studies reported a minor favorable change in a lung function test factoring in the bronchodilator use, with only a few and mild side effects noted. Finally, we were unable to collect analyzable data from trials comparing the two types of bronchodilators, but these studies reported that both types of bronchodilators improved lung function, and no side effects were mentioned.

Despite these findings, the hard truth is that the evidence provided by these trials is very limited, meaning we cannot declare with confidence the effect of these bronchodilators in CF patients with these short trials. These trials were mostly designed to measure the immediate effect of the bronchodilators, but CF care involves managing symptoms over a longer time, making it necessary to conduct more extensive and longer-term trials to establish the effects and safety of these bronchodilators.
