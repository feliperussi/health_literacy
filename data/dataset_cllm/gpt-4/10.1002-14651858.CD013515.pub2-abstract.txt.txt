1. Plain Title: 
Exploring if Mind Therapies Help with Jaw Pain

2. Rationale: 
This study focuses on Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), which are discomforts affecting the jaw. People with TMD often suffer from constant (chronic) pain that can be hard to handle, and it can affect normal life. Psychological therapies, which involve the mind, are believed to help people with TMD control their pain. This could lead to less pain, and therefore less distress and difficulty in daily life. The primary idea behind our study is to see how effective these mind-based therapies are for managing TMD stress and pain in people who are 12 years and older, and who have suffered from jaw pain for at least 3 months.

3. Trial Design: 
The research study was carried out by analyzing a number of published and ongoing studies, across six different databases, up to the date of 21st October 2021. The methods used to pick these studies focused on random control tests (RCTs) that used psychological therapy such as behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness and specifically cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), as ways to handle TMD pain. The impact of these therapies was then compared to other types of treatments such as using a mouth support device, taking medication or physiotherapy. The studies we analyzed comprised of more than 2000 people and took place between the years 1967 and 2021. Important outcomes we looked at were: levels of pain, daily life activities affected by pain, any unwanted side effects, and mental distress. The shortest length of treatment was 4 weeks, and people were monitored from anywhere between 3 months to 12 months after the treatment.

4. Results: 
What we found was that, immediately after treatment, there was no clear evidence that CBT made a difference to the levels of pain when compared to other treatments or no treatment at all. However, a small benefit of CBT was seen in reducing pain levels at the follow-up stage compared to other treatments or no treatment. There was no noticeable difference in terms of how much pain interfered with daily activities, between CBT and either other treatments or no treatment. There were very few reports of unwanted side effects, and those that did occur were minor and seemed to occur less often than with other treatments. However, there was not enough data to draw a concrete conclusion.

CBT showed a small advantage in reducing mental distress at the end of the treatment compared to other treatments, an effect which was held at follow-up. We identified that the usefulness of the study's evidence was low, mostly due to the high chance of bias. Our study does not provide any strong conclusions about mind therapies apart from CBT. 

In conclusion, we have found mixed evidence about whether mind-based therapies are effective for painful TMD. CBT may have some benefits compared to other treatments, but not as a sole treatment, in reducing pain and mental distress. The evidence suggests that it may not be more effective than other treatments in reducing pain-related daily life interference. However, we need more research to confirm whether psychological therapies work, which ones are the best, and how they can be most effective.
