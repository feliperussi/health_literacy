1. Plain Title: 
Studying the Effectiveness of Compression Socks for Early Varicose Vein Treatment

2. Rationale: 
Varicose veins are enlarged veins that can be seen typically in your legs and feet. These veins can cause discomfort or pain to those who have them. Many medical professionals will recommend compression socks as the first step to treat varicose veins, especially for patients without a history of leg ulcers. However, it's not clear whether these socks work well in the early stages of varicose veins. The purpose of our study was to find out whether patients without leg ulcers can benefit from using compression socks to manage their varicose veins and if some compression socks work better than others.

3. Trial Design: 
We carried out a search of different databases and trial registers, looking at several studies conducted up until May 2020. We paid attention to studies that included people who had varicose veins but no history of leg ulcers. These studies compared compression socks with no treatment, placebo socks, or alongside drugs, and looked at different lengths and pressures of compression socks. Our summary includes 13 different studies with 1,021 participants, including pregnant women and patients awaiting varicose vein surgery. The studies varied in what kind of socks they used, the pressure level of the socks, and the specifics of the patient population.

4. Results: 
In terms of symptom relief, each of the four studies that investigated this area suggested that wearing compression socks did make the patients feel better. Minor side effects, such as itching and irritation, were reported but no major side effects were identified. How long and how often the patients wore the socks differed from study to study. One found that many participants stopped wearing the socks due to discomfort. Others concluded that most participants did consistently wear the socks.  People's comfort in wearing the socks was impacted by who was wearing them - for example, pregnant women were less likely to wear them as their pregnancy advanced. Overall, it wasn't clear that wearing the socks improved the patients' quality of life. 

When they investigated various types and pressures of socks, the studies showed no major differences in effectiveness. Again, wearing the socks resulted in some degree of symptom relief. Common side effects included sweating, itching, skin dryness, tightening, or constriction. And again, no major side effects were reported. There was no clear difference in how consistently people wore different types or pressures of compression socks. The main reason that people preferred one type of sock over another was discomfort.

Ultimately, the evidence gathered in these studies isn't strong enough for us to draw a conclusion about whether or not compression socks help treat varicose veins in people without leg ulcers - or if some types of socks work better than others. More careful studies with more participants would be needed to answer these questions.
