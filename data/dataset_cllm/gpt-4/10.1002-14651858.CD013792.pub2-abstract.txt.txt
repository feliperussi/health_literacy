1. Plain Title: 
Studying Pregnancy Hormone Treatments for Women at Risk of Miscarriage

2. Rationale:
Miscarriages, the unfortunate loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks, is more frequent than we may think. Approximately every 1 in 4 women experience a miscarriage at some point in their lives, with 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending this way. For these women, the pregnancy hormone called 'progesterone' plays an important part in keeping the pregnancy healthy. Researchers have tried to see if giving more progesterone can help to prevent miscarriages in certain situations, like in women who are bleeding early in their pregnancy (threatened miscarriage) or in women who've had three or more miscarriages in the past. This study was designed to find out how effective different kinds of progesterone treatments are for threatened and recurrent miscarriages, and to figure out which treatments might work the best and be the safest.

3. Trial Design:
Medical researchers looked at many studies about progesterone treatments from several databases like Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2020. They included scientific research that focused on how well progesterone treatments prevented miscarriages. They particularly looked at seven studies that involved 5,682 women. All these studies took place in hospitals and the women were given different types of progesterone treatments or a placebo (a control substance with no active ingredients for comparison). The main thing the scientists wanted to see was how many women gave birth to live babies and if there were any health issues along the way.

4. Results:
Based on this study, it seems progesterone treatments probably don't change the rate of women giving birth to live babies for people with threatened or recurrent miscarriages. However, a specific progesterone treatment (called 'vaginal micronized progesterone') might slightly improve the chance of having a live birth in women who've had one or more miscarriages before and are bleeding early in their pregnancy. As for side effects, there probably aren't any major differences between taking progesterone and the placebo. More research needs to be done to understand how different types of progesterone affect women with threatened and recurrent miscarriages.
