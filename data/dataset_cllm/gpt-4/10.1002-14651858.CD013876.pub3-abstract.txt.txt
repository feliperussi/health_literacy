Plain Title: 
Studying Treatments for Long-Term Loss of Smell After COVID-19

Rationale: 
People sometimes lose their sense of smell when they get COVID-19. Sadly, for some, this issue last even long after recovering from the illness. This problem can seriously affect their quality of life. Currently, doctors aren't sure how to best treat ongoing smell loss from COVID-19. Different methods such as training the sense of smell or using certain medicines have been tried. However, nobody is sure which of these actually helps. This study was performed to explore what kind of help really works best for ongoing smell loss after COVID-19. The study also aimed to keep updating their findings as they find more information.

Trial Design: 
This study was conducted to inspect how effective and safe different treatments for loss of smelling (due to COVID-19) were. The experiment was expanded from a previous study in 2021 by including an extra research piece. The study only included patients who had been unable to smell properly for at least one month due to COVID-19. The aim was to compare the effects of different treatments with people who did not receive any treatment. The key focus was on how well the sense of smell comes back, how the disease affects the quality of life, and any serious side effects. Other secondary factors like changes in the sense of smell, overall quality of life and any other side effects, such as nose bleeds, were also noted.

Results: 
The study included results from two different trials involving a total of 30 people. In the first experiment, 18 people who hadn't been able to smell anything for at least a month after COVID-19 were given some drugs along with nasal cleaning for 15 days. And in the second experiment, 12 people with the same loss of smell for at least three months were given two specific medicines for a month. However, because each experiment was quite small and involved a tiny number of people compared to the global population, it was hard to draw any solid conclusions from these results. The evidence gathered so far isn't strong enough to be sure of the benefits for the patients or to determine how notable this study was for the field of medicine. 

In conclusion, right now we still have limited evidence on which treatments work best for ongoing smell loss after COVID-19. However, more studies are being done on this and as we get the results, we will keep updating our findings.
