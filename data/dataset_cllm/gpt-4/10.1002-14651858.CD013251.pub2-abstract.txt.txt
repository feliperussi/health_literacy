1. Plain Title: 
Using Steam Therapy to Treat Urinary Problems in Men

2. Rationale: 
Some men experience problems when passing urine (urinary symptoms) due to a non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland (benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). This problem can hurt the quality of life. In the past, a surgical method known as transurethral resection was used. Now, we have less invasive options. One of these new methods uses steam (heated water) energy to kill off problematic tissue in the prostate gland. This method is called convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy. The aim of this study was to check if this steam therapy could help treat urinary symptoms in men with BPH.

3. Trial Design: 
This study looked at reports from different sources including databases, trial registries, and conference records up till February 2020. The research included men with BPH who underwent steam therapy and compared them to others who either had different treatments or a fake procedure. The study was performed by two authors who independently reviewed the collected reports. Our focus was a trial that looked at 197 men using this therapy that compared it to a fake procedure. The men involved were on average 62.9 years old and their prostate was averaging a volume of 45.4 mL. The data collected only covered results up to three months after the procedure.

4. Results: 
The findings suggest that steam therapy can help improve urinary symptoms in men more than a fake procedure. The quality of life of these men also likely improved. However, we are not certain about major adverse events or complications following the therapy. The therapy may not have an effect on erectile function and could result in minor issues. There's also a high chance that men might require urinary catheters after the therapy. We found no other research comparing this therapy with other treatments like transurethral resection. The results of this study are based on a single report, and there is a need for more data and longer follow-up. Despite some of the potential issues, this therapy could be a worth-considering option for men with BPH who are dealing with urinary symptoms.
