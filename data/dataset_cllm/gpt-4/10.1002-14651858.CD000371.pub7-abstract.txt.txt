1. Plain Title: 
Does Regularly Giving Children Worm Medication Help Improve Their Health and School Performance?

2. Rationale: 
Worms in the body are a common problem among school-aged children, especially in certain parts of the world. These worms can make children sick, affect their growth, and hurt their ability to learn. To solve this, some health organizations suggest that we should regularly give school children medication to get rid of these worms. Some even believe this will bring noticeable health and societal benefits, beyond just removing the worms. To understand if this is true, this study was set up to see the effects of these medications on different areas like kids' growth, blood health, thinking ability, school attendance and performance, physical fitness, and even the risk of death.

3. Trial Design: 
To fully explore how this medication affects children, we looked at 51 different studies that examined the impacts of these deworming drugs on kids aged 16 years or less. The studies measured how the children's weight, height, blood health, and thinking ability changed after taking the medication. The studies also explored the impacts on other aspects like school attendance and performance, physical fitness, and even risk of death. This study then compared such measures from children who were given the worm medication versus children who were not. 

4. Results: 
We found that when kids were given deworming medication just once or routinely, most studies showed little or no effect on their weight, height, blood health or thinking ability. The evidence about if the drugs change school attendance or performance was not consistent and not strong enough to prove any effect. Also, there's not enough data to know if these medications affect physical fitness. 

Previous studies done over 20 years ago seemed to show that kids who took the medication had a larger weight gain. But new and larger studies have not shown this effect. We carefully considered why there might be this difference and we cannot say with certainty why this is the case. 

Lastly, after considering evidence from three trials involving over a million children, we found these medications had no impact on reducing kids' risk of death. 

Our conclusion from this study is that regularly treating all kids with worm medications does not seem to improve their physical growth, blood health, thinking capacity, school performance, physical fitness, or risk of death. However, we continue to need more and better data in order to fully understand the impacts on school attendance and physical fitness.
