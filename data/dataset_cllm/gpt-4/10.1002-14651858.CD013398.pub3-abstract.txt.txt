1. Plain Title: 
Can House Changes Help Fight Malaria?

2. Rationale: 
Malaria is a preventable disease caused by mosquito bites. Despite advances in medicine, malaria continues to be a major public health issue around the world. With progress in fighting malaria at a standstill, researchers are looking at new ways to tackle this problem. One forgotten method from the 1900s is changing the way houses are built to keep mosquitos out and reduce the chance of people getting infected. This study looks at how effective it is to make changes to a house to prevent mosquitos from getting in.

3. Trial Design: 
This study explored a wide variety of research sources, including medical research registries and medical databases, to find reports of studies looking at changing house designs to combat malaria. It focused on high-quality study designs like randomized controlled trials and cross-over studies. This wide search enabled the researchers to find six relevant studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. These studies looked at the effects of modifying different parts of a house - like windows, doors, ceilings, and roofs - to prevent mosquitos from entering. 

4. Results:
Out of the six studies, two of them have reported their findings so far. These studies were carried out in Ethiopia and The Gambia, and they found that homes with screens on windows and doors were less affected by malaria. The results showed a lower number of malaria cases and a fewer number of people carrying the malaria parasite. Despite this encouraging picture, research also showed that people in houses with screens were slightly less likely to use bed nets, another important tool in preventing malaria. Therefore, while the findings show that making changes to houses can help reduce malaria, it's also important to continue using other prevention methods. 

More results are expected from the four remaining studies. These will provide more information about how effective it is to modify houses as a way of combating malaria.
