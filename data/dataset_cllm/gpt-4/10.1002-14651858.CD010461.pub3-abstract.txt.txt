"Advanced Techniques in Choosing Healthy Sperms for In-Vitro Fertilisation and Their Effects"

2. Rationale
When couples are struggling to have a baby naturally, one method that helps is Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), including In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) by fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab. Sometimes, advanced techniques are used to choose a high-quality sperm to fertilize the egg, increasing the chances of a successful pregnancy. The dilemma is to whether these advanced techniques are more successful than the standard IVF procedures.

3. Trial Design
This study hunted for and examined various experiments carried out worldwide that compared sperm selection techniques to standard IVF. Such experiments had to be random, meaning the participating women (aged 18+) didn't choose which method they received. Eight suitable studies involving 4147 women were found and included in this analysis. The search took place in June of 2018.

4. Results
The eight research experiments compared different advanced sperm selection methods with the traditional IVF way. Common methods included those that select sperm according to its makeup, such as its ability to bind to a sugar called hyaluronic acid (HA). 

From the gathered results, it seems that using sperm selected by its ability to bind to hyaluronic acid (referred to as HA-ICSI) may not make a big difference to live birth rates compared to the standard method of ICSI. The chance of live birth with the traditional method was 25% while with HA-ICSI it ranged from 24.5% to 31%. However, this technique may lower the chance of recurrence: the risk was 7% with the traditional ICSI technique, while with the HA-ICSI method it varied between 3% and 6%. 

As for other advanced techniques compared to traditional methods, the study did not provide conclusive results due to the low number of women involved in the trials as well as other limitations. For example, Zeta sperm selection showed potential of having higher live birth rates and lesser miscarriages, but the evidence was not strong enough.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that using sperm selected by hyaluronic acid might not make a big difference on live birth or chances of getting pregnant, but it might lessen the chances of a miscarriage. However, whether the other advanced sperm selection techniques have any clear advantage or disadvantage is still uncertain. As such, more thorough, high quality studies are necessary to be sure about the effectiveness of these techniques.
