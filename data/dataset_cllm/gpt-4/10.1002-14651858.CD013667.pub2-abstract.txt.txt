Plain Title: 
Understanding the Most Effective Ways to Help Young People Who Self-Harm

Rationale: 
Self-harming, where a person intentionally hurts themselves, is a growing issue around the world. Often, those who self-harm will do it more than once and it could lead to suicide. It's especially concerning among children and teenagers. However, we don't have enough information about the best ways to help these young people compared to adults. This study was carried out to update an earlier review from 2015 on how to better help children and teenagers who self-harm.

Trial Design: 
We wanted to understand how two types of treatments (talking therapies and medicine) could help stop children and teenagers under 18 years from self-harming. These treatments were compared with the normal help that's given. We looked at different published studies up to 4 July 2020. We chose to look at studies that tested their treatments on young people who had a recent experience with self-harm that led them to see a doctor or nurse. We followed up with these young people for up to two years to see if they self-harmed again. We also looked at if they kept taking their treatment, how they felt, how they were living, and if they thought about suicide.

Results: 
We looked at data from 17 studies that had tested their treatments on a total of 2,280 young people. Most of these young people (88 out of 100) were girls and the average age was around 15 years old. All the studies we looked at had tested different types of talking therapies. None had tested medical treatment on these young people.

One type of talking therapy (DBT-A) had fewer young people self-harm again (30 out of 100) compared to the usual help given (43 out of 100). We felt sure about this result. 

We also found that one-on-one talking therapy (CBT) didnâ€™t seem to help young people from self-harming again compared to the usual help provided. However, we're not that confident about this result.

We're not sure if another type of talking therapy (MBT-A) helps protect young people from self-harming again compared to the usual help. This result was even less clear than the last one.

Family therapy did not appear to make a difference in preventing young people from self-harming again compared to the usual help. We think this result is kind of reliable.

We also found no clear proof that other methods, like having a contact person for emergencies, helped to prevent self-harm in young people after six or 12 months.

In conclusion, based on the shaky nature of the evidence and the small number of studies done, we are unsure about how effective different talking therapies are in helping children and teenagers who self-harm. Understanding how to use DBT-A better could be helpful, given our result. It's also worth exploring CBT more and seeing how it could help young people given its success with adults.
