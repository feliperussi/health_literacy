1. Plain Title: How Study Results Influence Their Publication
2. Rationale: Often, medical research may not become well-known because it doesn't get released or talked about. This can happen if the results of the study don't go as planned, such as not showing any helpful outcomes. This is a problem called publication bias, and it means that people don't get a full understanding of what the science says. Imagine you only hear about weight loss diets that work, and never hear about the ones that don't. This can lead to a belief that most diet plans are efficient, which may not be true. This study was done to see if publication bias actually happens, and to find out if the results of a study influence whether or not it's likely to be published.
3. Trial Design: The team looked for past studies that checked if the results of a study (whether they were important or unimportant, positive or negative) affected whether it was published. Several sources were checked, including libraries of previous studies, medical databases and direct contacts with researchers for any additional studies. Once the relevant studies were identified, two authors began to analyze the data. They classified the findings as either positive (important, showing a positive effect) or negative (unimportant, showing no effect or a negative effect). They also tried to find other factors that could affect whether a study gets published. 
4. Results: After looking at five different studies, this study found that if the results of a study are positive, it's almost two times more likely that the study will be published compared to when the results are negative or show no effect. Also, studies with positive results were usually published much faster (around 4-5 years) than those with negative results (which can take 6-8 years). The study didn't find any connection between the size of the study and whether or not it was published. It also didn't find any link between who funded the study, the rank of the scientist, or the gender of the scientist and whether the study was published. So, this study shows that positive results do seem to make it more likely for a study to get published, and get published faster.
