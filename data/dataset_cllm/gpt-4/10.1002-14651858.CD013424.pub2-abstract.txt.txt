Plain Title: 
Study on Use of Osteoporosis Drugs in Patients with Kidney Disease

Rationale:
Kidney disease is a condition that can cause other health issues, including osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones. This makes a person more likely to have fractures or broken bones. In this study, we wanted to know if osteoporosis drugs, which help to strengthen bones, are safe and successful in patients with kidney disease. This is important because kidney disease might change how the body absorbs and uses the minerals that keep bones strong.

Trial Design:
We reviewed seven studies involving 9,164 women who were diagnosed with osteoporosis and kidney disease. The kidney disease of these patients ranged from moderate to severe, including those on dialysis treatment. We looked for any changes in fracture occurrence, bone density, death rates, side effects, and overall quality of life of patients taking osteoporosis drugs. This study lasted from the time we found the first relevant study till 25 January 2021.

Results:
For women with moderate kidney disease, our review suggested that osteoporosis drugs possibly lowered the rate of fractures in the spine. However, these drugs seem not to have a large impact on overall fracture rates and side effects. For women with severe kidney disease, it is unclear if these drugs lower the rate of overall fractures or death. Although, they might slightly improve bone density in the spine. We did not find any reported side effects in these studies. 

More research needs to be done to find out the effect of osteoporosis drugs in the specific stages of kidney disease. This can help us understand if and how these drugs might help men, children, or patients with a less stable stage of kidney disease.
