Plain Title: 
Studying the Role of Cholesterol Medicine in Treating Asthma

Rationale: 
Asthma is a long-lasting lung disease that can make it hard for people to breathe. Asthma can cause tightness in the chest, coughing and even breathlessness. One of the treatments being considered to help with asthma is a group of medicines known as "statins." Statins are usually used to manage cholesterol levels in blood, but experts believe they could also help treat asthma. We need more information on whether statins can truly help, and what risks they may carry, to understand if they could be recommended in asthma treatment.

Trial Design: 
We looked for studies that used statins as an extra treatment for asthma. The studies should have been for 12 weeks or more and included participants diagnosed with asthma, of any age and health severity, and receiving any type of treatment. We searched major medical conferences and trial registries to find both ongoing and finished studies. We also looked at earlier research papers for more study possibilities. The findings we are presenting are up-to-date as of February 2020, reflecting the latest available evidence.

Results: 
We could find only one study that used statins (specifically, a statin called atorvastatin) as a treatment for asthma. This study was done with 60 people living with asthma. This study compared taking atorvastatin to taking a "dummy" pill, with no active treatment. Unfortunately, this study did not report on the results we were most interested in, or any side effects. It also left us unsure about how atorvastatin affected participants' lung function. Finally, there were some mistakes in the numbers in the study. Because of all this, we can't make any clear conclusions about using statins to treat asthma. 

We need well-planned studies, with more participants and a longer time using statins, to really understand if statins help with asthma. This future research should specifically look at things like any bad effects of the treatment, if it helps avoid hospital stays, and how much it costs. Researchers should also include overweight people with asthma, to see if there may be different effects in this group.
