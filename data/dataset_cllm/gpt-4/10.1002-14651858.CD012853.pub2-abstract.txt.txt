1. Plain Title: Understanding the Effects of Marijuana on People with Crohn's Disease 

2. Rationale: Crohn's Disease is a chronic immune disorder causing painful inflammation in the digestive tract, which can negatively affect a person's daily life. This study wants to understand if marijuana and its components (cannabinoids) can help treat this condition. Reports suggest marijuana might decrease inflammation in animals, but it might also cause side effects like weakness or diarrhea in people, or even increase their risk of surgery. This study is important because it can help determine if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment for people with Crohn's Disease. 

3. Trial Design: This study looked at scientific articles from databases and registers and contacted researchers to find ongoing clinical trials or unpublished studies. When they found relevant studies, the team examined how data were collected and analyzed. They mainly looked for changes in Crohn's disease activity and if there were any drug side effects causing people to stop treatment. They analyzed the certainty and relevance of their findings too. 

4. Results: They found three studies that were relevant. All of these looked at the effects of marijuana in people who had Crohn's disease and were not responding to their treatment. The team couldn't combine the results from these studies because of differences in treatment types. 

   The first study used marijuana cigarettes and found some symptom improvement but also saw side effects like sleepiness and confusion. 

   The second study used a low-dose marijuana oil, and it also showed some symptom relief with no increase in severe side effects than those who took the dummy drug. 

   The third study used a higher dose of marijuana oil and found a significant improvement in disease activity and quality of life scores compared to the dummy drug. 

Despite these results, the researchers concluded that the effects of marijuana or marijuana oils on Crohn's disease are still unclear. They point out that future studies should include more participants, use various marijuana doses, and different ways of taking the drug. They also suggested research on people with mild Crohn's disease symptoms.
