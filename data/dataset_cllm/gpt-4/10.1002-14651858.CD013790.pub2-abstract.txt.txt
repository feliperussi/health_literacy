1. Plain Title: Heated Tobacco Products' Impact on Smokers
2. Rationale: Some smoking products, like heated tobacco products (HTPs), heat up tobacco leaves without setting them on fire or creating smoke. This separates them from e-cigarettes, which use liquid instead of leaves. Manufacturers of HTPs believe these devices make fewer dangerous chemicals than traditional cigarettes. Some smokers even say they quit ordinary cigarettes by switching to HTPs. However, it's crucial to determine if HTPs help people quit smoking attempts and if they are safe. This is important so that medical professionals can advise their patients properly and so that policymakers can set up the right rules for HTPs. 
3. Trial Design: This study wanted to see if HTPs work well for quitting smoking, if they are safe, and how they impact overall smoking rates. They searched several databases for earlier studies until January 2021. These other studies must have been randomized controlled trials, where smokers were randomly chosen to either use HTPs or continue their current habits. They followed the participants to see what happened to them over time. The main things they looked for were the success rate of quitting smoking, any chemical changes in the body, and changes in smoking rates in the whole population.
4. Results: They found 13 other studies to include in their analysis. These were made up of 11 trials that tested safety with 2666 people, and two studies looking at smoking trends. However, no studies reported on whether people successfully quit smoking using HTPs. There wasn't enough evidence to tell if there was a difference in health risk between smokers switching to HTPs or continuing with cigarettes. There was some evidence that HTP users had less exposure to harmful chemicals than cigarette smokers. The cigarette sales in Japan fell faster after HTPs were introduced to the market, but the study couldn't say for sure if this meant fewer people were smoking. The researchers concluded that more independently funded work is needed to find out whether HTPs are effective and safe for quitting smoking.
