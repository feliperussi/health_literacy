1. Plain Title: 
How Well Does Intravenous Ketorolac Work in Relieving Post-Operation Pain?

2. Rationale: 
After surgery, it is common for patients to experience pain. Sometimes this pain can be severe. One way to manage this pain is to use small amounts of an opioid drug. However, these opioids have risks of their own, like side effects. One possible solution to this problem is the use of a different type of drug known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study wanted to see how effective one of these NSAIDs, called Ketorolac, is at reducing post-operation pain when given through an IV.

3. Trial Design: 
To find out whether Ketorolac could help reduce post-operation pain, the researchers looked at several previous studies. These studies involved adults who had undergone a variety of surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, orthopedic) and were experiencing moderate to severe pain. The ages of these patients ranged from about 23 to 67 years old. The researchers wanted to see if these patients had less pain and used less additional medication to manage pain after being given a single dose of Ketorolac.

4. Results: 
The overall results show that the pain drug Ketorolac, might help lower the amount of pain adults experience after surgery. When using Ketorolac, more patients found significant reduction in their pain compared to those who took a placebo (a substance with no active drug). Also, they waited longer before needing to take extra medicine for pain. However, the results are not totally clear, and there's a chance we could be wrong. 

Additionally, people who took Ketorolac tended to have slightly more side effects compared to those who took a placebo or a different NSAID. However, these side effects were not overly serious. As for comparing Ketorolac to other NSAIDs – like Parecoxib and Diclofenac – there didn't seem to be much difference, neither in pain control nor in the occurrence of side effects.

But remember, though Ketorolac showed promise in bringing relief, more studies are needed to be sure about its effectiveness and safety. We are especially interested in how it works for elderly people or for those with cardiovascular conditions, who might be at higher risk for side effects.
