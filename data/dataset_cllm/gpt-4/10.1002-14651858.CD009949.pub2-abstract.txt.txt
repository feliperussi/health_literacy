1. Plain Title: 
Understanding if Draining Fluid from the Elbow Helps in Healing Elbow Fractures

2. Rationale:
Elbow fractures, particularly those that affect the 'radial head' (the top of the forearm bone that meets the elbow), are very common. They usually happen when you fall and try to stop your fall by reaching out your arm. These fractures can vary from minor to severe. Doctors have tried to reduce discomfort by draining or 'aspiring' fluid from the elbow joint that can build up after such fractures. However, this method may cause more harm than good, such as nerve injuries or infections. So, this study was undertaken to see whether the benefits of draining fluid from the elbow outweigh any risks when treating elbow fractures in adults.

3. Trial Design:
For this study, we looked at past clinical trials that compared treatment of elbow fractures by draining fluid or not. We only included studies involving adults, preferably over 30 years of age. From dozens of relevant research databases and registries, we shortlisted two trials involving 126 participants. Of these, we could only gather result data from 108 participants due to certain issues in the trials. The fractures in these participants ranged from minor to severe.

4. Results:
Our analysis showed that both trials had a high risk of bias, meaning their results may not be very accurate or reliable. That's why we're not confident in these estimates. We found that the ability to perform daily tasks related to weight carrying (one year after the injury) was basically the same whether or not fluid was drained from the elbow. Side effects from draining the elbow joint were not reported in the trials, but we did find that it didn't work in around 8% cases.

In terms of pain relief, there seems to be a minor short-term benefit from draining fluid, but it's unclear whether this benefit lasts. Neither trial carefully checked or reported on possible harm from the procedures. It's also unclear whether elbow motion was improved after a year with or without fluid drainage. Despite the lack of complete details, no major complications like further elbow instability or fracture displacement were reported. 

In conclusion, based on these studies, we don't yet know if draining fluid from the elbow joint is helpful or safe for treating elbow fractures. To make an informed decision, we need more research focusing on gathering evidence on the procedure's effects and patients' experiences. This can help guide future large-scale trials to provide clearer evidence regarding the use of fluid drainage in treating elbow fractures.
