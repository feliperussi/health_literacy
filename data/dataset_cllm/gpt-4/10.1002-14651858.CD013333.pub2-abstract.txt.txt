1. Plain Title: 
Study on the Effect of Tea Tree Oil on Demodex Blepharitis

2. Rationale:
Demodex blepharitis is a long-lasting condition linked to stubborn dry eye symptoms. It is caused by tiny mites that live on the skin, named Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. This condition affects many adults and both men and women experience it equally. People with Demodex blepharitis often turn to tea tree oil for relief, but we're not sure how well it really works. This study was conducted to understand better the impact of tea tree oil in treating this condition.

3. Trial Design:
To find out the effect of tea tree oil on Demodex blepharitis, we reviewed six studies with 562 participants. Everyone in the study was between 39 and 55 years old and had been diagnosed with Demodex blepharitis. These studies examined the effect of tea tree oil on the mites causing the condition. Participants were observed over a span of four to six weeks. 

4. Results:
From the six studies, three provided data that showed a small average reduction in the number of mites in the eyelashes of those who used tea tree oil. Though the reduction was small, we can't confidently say tea tree oil caused this change. The group that received a different treatment, such as intense pulsed light, showed no signs of mites after three months. 

For participant-reported symptoms, three studies found no difference between the tea tree oil group and those receiving other treatments. One study included information on vision clarity but didn't give enough data for us to compare between groups. 

When it came to side effects, one study showed none while two reported some participants having slight discomfort in their eyes after using tea tree oil. No data was provided on long-term changes. 

In short, we're not sure if using tea tree oil can effectively treat Demodex blepharitis in the short term. If used, it seems that lower amounts may be better to avoid discomfort in the eye. More well-planned studies need to be done to figure out the effects of different amounts of tea tree oil.
