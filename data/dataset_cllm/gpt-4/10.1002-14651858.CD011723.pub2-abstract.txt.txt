1. Plain Title:
Mindfulness Training for Substance Abuse Problems

2. Rationale:
Substance use disorders, including troubles with drugs and alcohol, are widespread and pose a significant public health issue. People with these problems often continue to have symptoms even after receiving treatment, and relapsing is common. Some therapies known as 'Mindfulness-Based Interventions' (think activities like meditation that help focus your mind) have been tested to treat substance use disorders, but the results have not been clearly positive or negative.

3. Trial Design:
In our study, we compared Mindfulness-Based Interventions with standard treatment or no treatment at all in people who suffer from substance abuse problems. Our focus was on drug and alcohol use disorders, not on tobacco use issues. The people in the study were either formally diagnosed with substance use disorders or showed clear signs of such problems. We examined a total of 40 scientific studies, with 35 of them involving 2825 participants included in our main review. Our approach followed standard research practices.

4. Results:
Based on our review, it's not clear whether Mindfulness-Based Interventions are better than no treatment at all in improving symptoms of substance abuse. The data didn't show clear differences in the number of drug-free days or the amount of drugs consumed between those who received the Mindfulness-Based Interventions and those who received no treatment at all. There was also no clear difference in the number of people who quit the study, which can tell us whether people found the treatment acceptable. There were very few details reported about unwanted side effects.

When comparing Mindfulness-Based Interventions with standard treatment, the results were also unclear. These interventions may lead to people having slightly fewer days with substance use following the treatment and for up to 10 months afterward. However, the data did not clearly show differences in the number of people who stopped using drugs entirely, the amount of drugs consumed, or the intensity of cravings for drugs between those who received Mindfulness-Based Interventions and those who received other standard treatments.

In conclusion, we are not certain whether Mindfulness-Based Interventions are effective in improving outcomes for people with substance use disorders compared to no treatment or other standard treatments. Few studies reported unwanted side effects.
