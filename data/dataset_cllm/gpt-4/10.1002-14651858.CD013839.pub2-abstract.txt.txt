1. Plain Title: Comparing Knee-Level and Above-Knee Amputations: Are There Differences?

2. Rationale: 
Diabetes and conditions affecting blood vessels can often lead to the extreme step of needing to remove a lower limb. With nearly half a billion adults living with diabetes around the globe and another 200 million suffering from peripheral vascular disease, this is a significant concern. When a foot or leg needs to be amputated, it's more beneficial for the patient if the knee can be saved because they are likely to recover better physically. However, in some cases, an amputation above the knee is required. There is yet another type, "through-knee" amputation, where the amputation is done at the knee level, which might be better than amputation done above the knee. The goal of this study was to find out how "through-knee" amputation compares to "above-knee" amputation in terms of patient recovery, complications, and overall outcomes. 

3. Trial Design:
We looked for studies that directly compare the results of 'through-knee' amputations and 'above-knee' amputations. We searched for both published and unpublished studies that followed a structured design called "randomized controlled trials", or "RCTs". These RCTs are tests where patients are randomly divided into groups - some receiving through-knee amputations and some receiving above-knee amputations. We focused on outcomes like how well the wound healed, whether a prosthetic limb was fitted, how long it took for patients to move around independently, the patient's quality of life, their walking speed, if pain was present, and whether patients survived beyond 30 days following the amputation. Various databases were used to find the studies and the search was completed by February 2021.  

4. Results: 
Despite our thorough efforts, we did not find any RCTs that met our criteria for this review. This means we don't have any firm conclusions right now whether a 'through-knee' amputation or 'above-knee' amputation is better for the patient in terms of their recovery, complications and overall outcomes. There still exists a knowledge gap that requires detailed research in the form of RCTs. This is essential as we look to make significant progress in the way we treat patients requiring amputations and ensure the best possible outcomes for them.
