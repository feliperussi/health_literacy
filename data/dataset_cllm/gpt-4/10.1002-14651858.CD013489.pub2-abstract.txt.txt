1. Plain Title: 
Helping Young Children Overcome Stuttering: Checking if Certain Methods Work
2. Rationale: 
Stuttering is not being able to speak smoothly. Around 11% of children who are four years old stutter. They may repeat sounds or words, have a hard time making the right sounds, or may show signs of struggle like blinking a lot or nodding their head. This trouble with talking can also make children feel bad, nervous, or have trouble in social situations. This research aimed to see if certain methods (that don't require medicine) can improve how children under six years old with stuttering talk, feel, and live their lives, and whether these methods cause any unwanted effects.
3. Trial Design: 
The scientists looked at studies where children six years old or younger who stutter were part of. They looked at methods that didn't need medicine. They compared children who got these methods to children who didn't. They looked at studies from different places and any time period with no language restrictions. They wanted to know how stuttering, talking, how the child feels, and the quality of life changed after the methods. They included a total of 4 studies, in which 151 children aged between two and six from Australia, New Zealand, and Germany participated. The treatment program called Lidcombe Program was given in a clinic, or through phone, and also practiced at home. The studies had different lengths from 12 weeks to nine months. 
4. Results: 
All the studies looked at how often the children stuttered. One study also looked at their ability to say words quickly and clearly. The Lidcombe Program reduced the stuttering in children compared to other children who were just waiting for treatment. Yet, since the program usually takes one to two years to complete, none of the children had finished the course when the data from the study was collected. The study that looked at speech efficiency noticed an improvement after the Lidcombe Program. However, only one study checked how the children did in the long term, but the data was incomplete. Still, there was less stuttering over time in that study. 
The results show that the Lidcombe Program might help to reduce stuttering and make children under six years speak more efficiently. However, the researchers tell us to take these results with a pinch of salt because the quality of evidence was not excellent and there might have been some bias in the studies. More research from independent teams is needed to better understand the short and long term effects of such programs without medicine to help children who stutter.
