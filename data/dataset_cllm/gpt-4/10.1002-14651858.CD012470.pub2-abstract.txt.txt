1. Plain Title
Different Treatments for Wrist Bone Breaks in Children

2. Rationale
The wrist, specifically the distal radius (part close to the wrist), is the most frequently broken bone in children. Some of these wrist fractures are buckle fractures, a type of fracture that is usually stable and doesn't displace or move. Then there are other types that may move and are not as stable. Different places use different treatments, from immobilising the broken bone to surgery for serious displacements. This study aimed to check the effects and usefulness of different ways to help heal these common wrist breaks in children, including ones who are still growing.

3. Trial Design
The research team looked carefully at various scientific research databases, registries of clinical trials, and reference lists up until May 2018. We considered studies that compared different treatments for wrist fractures in children. The key data we looked for in these studies were on physical function, treatment failure, harmful events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), pain, and satisfaction of child and parents. Thirty studies were included, involving a total of 2930 children, typically more boys than girls and of an average age between 8 and 10 years. The break types ranged from buckle fractures to displaced fractures.

4. Results
The studies gave different conclusions, but overall, they showed that all treatments resulted in children fully returning to their previous activities with no serious harmful events, including not breaking the wrist again. For buckle fractures, removable splints seemed to work just as well at similar or less cost than traditional below-elbow casts. Soft or elastic bandages were also found to be a convenient option.

For mostly buckle fractures, parents removing casts at home was found to be just as effective and safe, with parents reporting higher satisfaction and lower healthcare costs. Comparing below and above elbow casts for unstable breaks, below-elbow casts were less limiting and caused fewer treatment failures.

When displaced fractures were treated with percutaneous wiring (small wires inserted through the skin) and a cast, there were fewer treatment failures and fewer adverse effects. However, the cost of this treatment was similar to the cost of treatment with cast only in the USA.

The studies show that treatment of wrist fractures in children is changing away from cast immobilization, with less invasive and less restrictive treatments showing similar or better results. More high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings, with some key topics already being tested in large ongoing studies.
