1. Plain Title: Assessing the Effectiveness of Different HPV Vaccines and Dose Schedules 

2. Rationale: The human papillomavirus (HPV)  is a common virus linked to several cancers, particularly cervical cancer in women. Vaccines are available to prevent this virus, but not everyone gets the vaccine, often due to difficulties getting all the doses. We wanted to see if fewer doses might work just as well and if the vaccine could also benefit males in addition to females. 

3. Trial Design: We looked at data from numerous studiesâ€•about 20 in total, involving close to 32,000 people. We focused on studies that included both boys and girls, as well as men and women, who were not infected with HIV, aged 9 to 26 years, and HIV-positive people of any age. The studies monitored the participants from seven months to five years after getting the vaccine.

4. Results: Our findings showed that two doses of HPV vaccine in girls aged 9 to 15 worked just as well as three doses for up to five years. We also found that spacing out the first two doses over six or 12 months instead of two or six months produced a stronger immune response in girls and boys aged 9 to 14. One type of HPV vaccine, called quadrivalent, was shown to reduce genital warts and other skin conditions in males aged 10 to 26. When comparing two types of HPV vaccines (nonavalent and quadrivalent), we found both offered a similar level of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval pre-cancer or cancer in males and females aged 9 to 26. For people living with HIV, both types of vaccines produced a strong immune response. However, we could not come to a clear conclusion about side effects or serious reactions to the vaccines because the evidence was limited or unclear. In conclusion, two-dose schedules in young females seemed to be as effective as three doses, and the quadrivalent vaccine appeared to reduce certain conditions in males. For people with HIV, both vaccines produced strong immunity. However, more studies are needed to better understand the long-term effectiveness of these dose schedules and potential side effects, as well as whether fewer doses will help more people get vaccinated.
