1. Plain Title: 
Can a Special Microscope Detect Skin Cancer Accurately?

2. Rationale: 
Skin cancer is a condition where some cells in the skin start growing out of control. This can cause harm to the surrounding skin or, in more serious types like melanoma, spread to other body parts. Early detection is vitally important because it can increase the chances of successful treatment and survival. Today's researchers are looking at a tool called Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM), a type of microscope, to see if it can identify skin cancers effectively, especially particular types like Basal Cell Carcinoma (a cancer that mostly stays local) without needing a biopsy, which is the removal and study of a skin sample. The challenge is to weigh the use of RCM against the risk of inaccurate diagnoses. 

3. Trial Design: 
The researchers searched through a wide range of databases to find studies about using RCM to detect skin cancers. They looked at any style of study where RCM was used to examine adults having suspect skin lesions, compared to established diagnostic methods involving scientific analysis or just tracking the lesions over time. The researchers collected data from each study independently, using a common procedure for data extraction and quality assessment. They also calculated potential outcomes like true positives (where the test correctly identifies the cancer), false positives (where the test mistakenly identifies cancer), false negatives (where the test misses the cancer), and true negatives (where the test correctly says no cancer). The team also looked at whether the experience of the observer using RCM played any role.

4. Results:
The researchers included 10 studies in their review, which made up 11 groups of participants. All the groups offered data for using RCM to detect Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), while only four groups gave data for the detection of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (another type of skin cancer). The findings showed that RCM scored higher in detecting BCC for participants with doubtful lesions but was less accurate for any suspicious lesion. In a model scenario with 1000 lesions, RCM could miss approximately 30 skin cancers and wrongly identify about 44 non-cancerous lesions as BCC. Additionally, RCM incorrectly identified up to 15% of skin cancers, particularly melanomas, as BCC. The researchers also found hints that RCM tests might have higher accuracies when conducted by more experienced observers. Unfortunately, there were not enough data to determine the effectiveness of RCM in identifying Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

Concluding, the researchers stated that there is insufficient evidence to recommend RCM for diagnosing Basal Cell Carcinoma or Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma conclusively. The tool might have potential uses in avoiding diagnostic biopsies when there's a high suspicion of BCC but requires more studies to establish its reliability, especially when distinguishing other skin cancers like melanoma. Equally important, there's a lack of data comparing RCM to standard diagnostic methods, with or without added skin examinations.
