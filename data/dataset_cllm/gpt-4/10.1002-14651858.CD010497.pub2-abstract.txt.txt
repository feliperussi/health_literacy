1. Plain Title: 
Looking into the Effects and Safety of Fumaric Acid Esters for Psoriasis Treatment 

2. Rationale: 
Psoriasis is a long-lasting skin disease that can greatly reduce the quality of life due to constant skin inflammation. There are various treatments available for severe cases of psoriasis. One of the treatments used is Fumaric Acid Esters (FAE), drugs that contain dimethyl fumarate — the key ingredient — and monoethyl fumarate. FAE are officially allowed for use in Germany but can be used in many other countries, although unofficially. The purpose of this study is to check how safe and effective FAE medications are for psoriasis treatment.

3. Trial Design: 
This study reviewed different research papers, references and conference data collected until 7th May 2015 to gather as much information as possible about the use of FAE for psoriasis. Participants of all ages and sexes, with a clear diagnosis of psoriasis, were considered in these studies. The researchers focused on measures like the change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores — a common way to measure severity and coverage of psoriasis — and how many people had to stop the treatment due to side effects. The data were collected from 6 studies involving a total of 544 participants which were conducted over a period of 12 to 16 weeks.

4. Results: 
These studies found that FAE treatment resulted in a significant decrease in psoriasis severity as measured by PASI scores. However, different studies reported the data in various ways, so it wasn't possible to combine the results. Out of the people who were treated with FAEs, two in thirteen had to stop due to the side effects while none among those on a false treatment (placebo) had to. 
However, the researchers found that out of every two people treated with FAEs, one person showed a 50% decrease in the severity of their psoriasis symptoms (PASI 50), which was a significant improvement compared to those on placebo. Also, there were more people achieving a 75% improvement in symptoms with FAE but the researchers did not combine this data as results were too different across studies. One study also found that participants’ quality of life improved significantly with FAE treatment. However, not all details could be derived from this study's abstract. 
It was noted that people using FAE experienced more side effects like stomach problems and flushing (sudden redness of the skin). About 76% of the people on FAE treatment had these side effects compared with 16% of the people who were on placebo. 
Lastly, FAE was compared with another drug called methotrexate (MTX). The results showed that MTX was better than FAE in reducing the PASI score but there was no significant difference when adjustments were made for initial disease severity. Similar to FAE, there were no significant differences in the number of side effects between the two drugs, except for flushing which was more common with FAE. 
In conclusion, the research suggests that FAE treatment is better than not having any treatment (placebo) and possibly equal to MTX treatment for psoriasis. However, FAE is likely to cause more minor side effects like flushing and stomach problems. It's important to note that these findings come from short-term studies and they may not provide information about rare or long-term effects of FAE. Finally, four out of the six studies that were considered in this research were only abstracts or brief reports, which may not provide full information, posing a limitation to the study's conclusions.
