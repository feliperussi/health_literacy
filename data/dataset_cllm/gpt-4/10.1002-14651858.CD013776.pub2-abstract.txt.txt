1. Plain Title: Comparing Blue Light and White Light Treatments For Non-deep Bladder Cancer
2. Rationale: Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), which is a type of bladder cancer that has not spread into the muscle wall of the bladder, unfortunately, often comes back or gets worse. We need better ways to treat this type of cancer to improve patients' health. One potential method is using blue light to assist during the removal of the bladder cancer. This method, known as Blue Light Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT), is compared to the more standard White Light TURBT. The study hopes to find out if Blue Light TURBT might work better than White Light TURBT in treating NMIBC.
3. Trial Design: This study is a review, meaning it collects and evaluates multiple scientific studies on the subject from various trusted sources up until March 2021, without limitations on the language or publication status. The works chosen all followed a set standard - they had to be properly conducted scientific studies that compared Blue Light TURBT and White Light TURBT methods in people thought or proven to have NMIBC. These patients could be new cases or recurrent cancers. If the blue light was used in a follow-up health check setting, those studies were not reviewed for this evaluation. Two independent reviewers checked the data.
4. Results: A total of 16 studies, which consisted of 4,325 patients, were examined for this review. People who underwent Blue Light TURBT treatment had lower rates of cancer coming back or getting worse. For example, up to 147 less per 1,000 high-risk patients had their cancer return when compared to the same group treated with White Light TURBT. As for cancer worsening, up to 56 fewer high-risk patients per 1,000 experienced this when treated with Blue Light method. The results also indicated that there may be a minimal effect on severe issues from surgery, with up to 10 fewer cases per 1,000 people when blue light was used. The impact on death from bladder cancer using Blue Light TURBT was unclear, as was the outcome on any adverse events. The study could not report on non-serious complications since this information was not provided in the studies reviewed. In conclusion, Blue Light TURBT might reduce the recurrence and progression of NMIBC, but this finding isn't set in stone. Future studies could provide updates and changes to these findings. The results aren't concrete due to some limitations in the studies reviewed, such as variability and data precision.
