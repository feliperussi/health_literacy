Plain Title:
The Impact of Sugar Consumption on Heart Health

Rationale:
High consumption of added sugar in our foods has been thought to contribute to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), a group of diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels. Understanding how sugar affects heart health might help us prevent these conditions. Thus, we decided to explore the effects of different levels of sugar intake. Our goal was to see how consuming high or low amounts of "extra" sugar impacts the heart's health.

Trial Design:
We carried out a thorough study, examining previous research done on this subject. This included looking at various medical databases and research journals and checking the reports of other studies for any extra data we could find. We used only studies that had followed a strict trial process. Our focus was on well-controlled studies comparing different levels of added sugar intake. We only used studies that included adults above the age of 18, who did not have diabetes or any prior heart diseases.

Results:
We gathered and analyzed data from 21 trials involving 1,110 participants who completed the interventions. These studies lasted on average for about 14 weeks. The participants were generally healthy, and their ages varied between 22 to 57 years.

We found out that consuming less added sugar may have a tiny effect on cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Lower sugar intake slightly lowered blood pressure and cholesterol in the body, but these changes were very minimal. Additionally, the data we have about these effects is not very reliable, as it was judged as low-quality evidence. So, weâ€™re not entirely confident in the strength of these results.

We did not find any solid evidence to suggest that eating less added sugar impacts other factors like our blood sugar level and different types of cholesterol in meaningful ways. Also, not many studies mentioned the effect of sugar on dental health or any side effects like stomach problems. 

Although we looked at many studies, none had investigated the direct link between added sugar and the incidence of cardiovascular events (like heart attacks) or death from any cause. The takeaway from our research is that there's no certain proof to show eating less added sugar can significantly lower your risk of developing heart disease. Nevertheless, it's still recommended to stick to current dietary guidelines, which encourage moderate sugar consumption.

In the future, more detailed studies are required. We also suggest future trials should evaluate more direct effects and make sure their funding source does not influence their results.
