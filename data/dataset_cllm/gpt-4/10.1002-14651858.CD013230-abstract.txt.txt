1. Plain Title: 
Helpful At-Home Treatments for Accidental Swallowing of Poisons

2. Rationale: 
Accidentally swallowing poison is a big health issue globally and can cause death or serious health problems. It is especially common among children under five years old. If there is a helpful treatment that people can carry out at home to slow down the poison's effects or clear it out, it could help reduce harm and save lives. The study tested treatments that a person can use before professional help arrives. It looked at methods like using activated charcoal (a remedy often used for poisoning cases), body positioning, and other possible treatments. 

3. Trial Design:
This study was designed to look at helpful treatments that someone could use in the event of swallowing poison, before getting professional help. Investigators looked at different scientific papers and study reports up until December 4, 2018. They focused on practical treatments that people could use at home, tested in scientific studies by comparing them with other treatments or no treatment at all. These included activated charcoal, certain drugs that can make someone vomit, body positioning, among other methods. The studyâ€™s aim was to see if these methods could reduce chances of death, harmful effects, and reduce how seriously someone is affected by the swallowing of the poison. The study also looked at negative effects of these treatments, how long the symptoms of poisoning last, and how many people had to go to the hospital or intensive care. Data from a total of 24 different studies, which included 7099 total participants, were used.

4. Results: 
The results showed that the quality of the studies reviewed wasn't always very good and were often not very complete, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. Many different cases of poisoning were considered, involving different poisons and treatments. Some involved activated charcoal treatment, while others looked at making someone vomit to try and clear the poison. Unfortunately, it was hard to be sure about whether these treatments made a big difference in how badly someone was affected by the poison, whether they had to go to intensive care, or whether they had any further health issues. There was one case where giving syrup, that helps to clear out the poison, resulted in more side effects but this needed more evidence to confirm. Also, no study seemed to look at methods like changing body position or diluting the poison. The reviewed studies mostly looked at hospital treatments and only one actually occurred at home, making them less helpful in understanding home treatments. Despite effort taken, there was not enough evidence to make sure conclusions about the value of these at-home interventions for swallowing poison.
