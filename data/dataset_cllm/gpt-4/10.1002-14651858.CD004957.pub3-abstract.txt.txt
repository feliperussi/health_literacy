1. Plain Title:
Rehabilitation After Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery Helps Recovery

2. Rationale:
Having to live with an ailing hip or knee joint can be significantly limiting and painful for patients. To alleviate this, many choose to undergo replacement surgeries. These surgeries are very common and typically lead to noticeable improvement. However, to get the most out of a replacement, patients usually undergo a planned rehabilitation program which is believed crucial for the best results.

The study aimed to find out whether a specially put together team (multidisciplinary) rehabilitation program actually helps improve patients’ daily activities, participation in social activities, and health after undergoing a replacement surgery for a worn-out hip or knee joint.

3. Trial Design:
For the purposes of this study, the researchers reviewed various trustworthy databases filled with health and science research reports up until September 2006. They specifically searched for trials that compared the effects of an organized rehabilitation team's efforts to usual care services after hip or knee replacement surgery.

In total, they found five suitable studies involving 619 adults who had undergone relevant surgeries. Two of these studies looked at patients treated in hospitals, while the other three examined those undergoing rehabilitation at home. None of the studies focused on outpatient centers.

4. Results:
The findings from these studies weren’t exactly clear-cut due to differences in how they were conducted. Also, the overall quality of these trials wasn't high. However, the evidence generally suggested that starting rehabilitation early and having a specific team-approach plan of action works well.

Patients who began rehab early and had a well-coordinated care plan were more likely to achieve key health goals. They also spent less time in the hospital and experienced fewer complications after surgery in the first three to four months. This, in turn, brings about cost savings.

Rehabilitation carried out at home also offered benefits. Home-based multidisciplinary care helped improve movement and quality of life, and reduced hospital stay time over the medium term (six months). 

The exact amount and frequency of rehabilitation needed for the best results, and the impact of rehab on long-term social costs, are still not clear and require further study. From the data available, there's good evidence that a well-planned, team-oriented rehabilitation program can improve patient outcomes following hip or knee replacement surgery. More rigorous research is needed to further validate these findings.

As a priority, future research should aim to enhance the scientific and methodological quality of these clinical trials and use standardized measures of outcomes. That would make it possible to pool results together for improved statistical analysis.
