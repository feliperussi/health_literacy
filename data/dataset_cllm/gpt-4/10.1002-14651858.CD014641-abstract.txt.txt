Plain Title: 
Understanding the Benefits of a Quick Tuberculosis Test for People with HIV

Rationale:
In people who have HIV, tuberculosis (TB) is the top reason they go to the hospital. Too many die in the hospital because of TB. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM for short) is a test that quickly shows if a person has TB. It's currently the only one approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). A review done in 2019 looked at how well AlereLAM works to find TB in people with HIV. Our research team wanted to look at whether this test affects things that matter to patients, like whether they live or die and how quickly they get diagnosed and treated for TB.

Trial Design:
To find out, we searched for to see what other research has been done on this topic. We wanted to find studies that compared AlereLAM to other TB tests in adults over the age of 15 years who have HIV. The other TB tests include ones that look for TB under a microscope, grow TB in a lab, or look for TB's DNA. We spoke with the authors of the studies for more details if needed. We then looked at all the data and did some math to figure out the risks for patients. 

Results:
We found three studies that were done in countries in Africa that are below the Sahara desert. Two studies were in a hospital and one was outside of the hospital. These studies looked at whether using AlereLAM along with other TB tests or a doctor's check-up could help to make faster, better choices in treating adults with HIV.

For the people who were in the hospital, using AlereLAM to find TB likely dropped deaths in people with HIV by 15% after eight weeks. Simply put, compared to other TB tests, using AlereLAM meant 34 less people out of 1000 died. The use of AlereLAM probably also made a minor rise in the number of people with HIV who got treated for TB.

For people who were not in the hospital, using AlereLAM to find TB may have reduced deaths in people with HIV after six months. Also, more people with HIV might have started TB treatment due to the use of AlereLAM. 

Benefits to Patients:
The studies showed that more people with HIV managed to give a urine sample than a spit sample for the TB test. Also, more people with HIV got a TB diagnosis when they were given the AlereLAM test. The AlereLAM test was better at spotting TB than other tests that used urine or spit samples. 

Finally:
The results back the use of AlereLAM alongside other TB tests that WHO recommends. It can help to find TB quickly in people with HIV. This matters because, for people with HIV, finding TB early can help start treatment early, which can save lives.
