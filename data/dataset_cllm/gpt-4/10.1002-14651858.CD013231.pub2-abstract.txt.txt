1. Plain Title: 
Breathing Support for Newborns with Quick Breath Problem

2. Rationale: 
Transient tachypnea of the newborn (quick breath) is a condition where a newborn infant breathes fast and has trouble breathing. It usually appears within the first two hours after birth. It mostly affects term and late pre-term infants, or babies born after 34 weeks of pregnancy. This condition can usually be managed using support like oxygen. One way to help reduce the breathing distress is by providing non-invasive respiratory support. This means helping the baby breathe without the need for a breathing tube. Such support could help clear the lungs of liquid, make breathing easier, bring relief from distress, and potentially reduce the time the baby breathes rapidly. Despite the potential to help, more scientific proof is needed to understand if this kind of support truly helps manage quick breath in newborns.

3. Trial Design: 
A search was done on different databases and registries of clinical trials to find studies done on this topic. The studies considered were ones where the respiratory support was non-invasive, given to babies born after 34 weeks of pregnancy but less than three days old, and diagnosed with quick breath. From these studies, data was collected such as number of babies involved, their birth weight, age and the duration of oxygen therapy. The study also took into account other treatments like continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, a type of respiratory support) and mechanical ventilation (using a machine to assist breathing), and the time taken for these treatments.

4. Results: 
Three trials were considered, involving 150 infants. The trials compared different types of breathing supports including those mentioned. However, from these studies, It was not clear that using CPAP was better than free oxygen in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation (using a machine to help baby breathe), or reducing the occurrence of another lung condition, pneumothorax, where air gets trapped in the space around the lungs. However, CPAP did help reduce the time the baby suffered with quick breath compared to just receiving free oxygen. Other methods of breathing support did not noticeably reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or the occurrence of pneumothorax. Also, the duration of quick breath did not differ much. Therefore, we did not find strong evidence that non-invasive respiratory support really helps manage quick breath in newborns. Also, the studies included had varying levels of quality and risk of biases, which makes it tough to conclude whether this support is truly safe or effective. As of now, two more studies on this topic are still going on.
