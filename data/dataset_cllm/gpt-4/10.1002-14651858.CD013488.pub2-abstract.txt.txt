1. Plain Title: Research on Correct Timing for Digestive Enzyme Medicine in Cystic Fibrosis Patients

2. Rationale:
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a serious, hereditary disease that affects several parts of the body in more than 70,000 people worldwide. About 80-90% of CF sufferers have trouble with digestion because their pancreas doesn't work properly. This can lead to problems with nutrition. There is a kind of medicine called Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT) that can help improve nutrition in CF patients, and even improve lung function. But there's a problem: we don't yet know the best time to take PERT regarding meal times. This is what the study was designed to look into.

3. Trial Design: 
The aim of the study was to find the best time to take PERT in order to improve fat digestion, nutrition, lung function and overall health in individuals suffering from CF. To find this out, we decided to examine previous studies which were part of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, a large list of previous CF research. This also included ongoing studies up until July 9, 2021. The plan was to use only studies where patients were randomly chosen to receive different PERT dosing times so that the results would be fair and unbiased. We also planned to only include studies that had a two-week break between treatments for more accurate results.

4. Results:
Unfortunately, we didn't find any studies that met our needs. The studies we looked at either didn't have a long enough break between treatments, or did not experiment with different times to take PERT. There was one study that was stopped early that we are still looking into. This means we were not able to make a conclusion about the best time to take PERT. We know that PERT can improve nutrition in CF patients, but we need more studies to figure out the best time to take it. This is crucial because many CF patients struggle with poor nutrition and digestive issues. By working out the best time to take PERT, we might be able to help improve these outcomes.

In order to fully understand how PERT dosing schedules can help CF patients with fat digestion, we need more research. This could involve using a design where patients try multiple dosing times with breaks in between to ensure accurate results. It's also important to be able to measure the results properly. This would involve finding out which outcomes are most important to patients, and creating standards around them. This way, we can have a full view of whether changing PERT dosing times can really make CF patients' lives better.
