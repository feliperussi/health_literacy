1. Plain Title: 
Does Using a Mouth Rinse Before Dental Treatments Lower the Risk of Infections in Dentists?

2. Rationale:
Visiting a dentist involves procedures that could create tiny droplets and mist. These can carry diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Dentists may catch these diseases by breathing them in, or if these touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Part of keeping dentists safe at work involves using masks and other protective clothing, and machines that suck away some of this mist. Some believe that if patients rinse their mouth before treatment, it could lower the number of harmful germs in the mist produced during their treatment. This study aimed to see if mouth rinses can lower the number of infections in dentists.

3. Trial Design:
The research team searched online databases using established ways to find studies that have looked into this question. They only looked at studies done in real-life situations with patients getting dental treatment, and not lab-based ones. The search was done up to 4th February 2022. They found studies that compared having a mouth rinse before a dental treatment to not having one, or using a placebo rinse (one that does not fight germs). The main thing they were interested in was whether fewer dentists got infections. They also wanted to know if mouth rinses could lower the level of harmful germs in the treatment area. Other things they looked into were the cost, possible side effects, and whether patients and dentists found the mouth rinses easy to use.

4. Results:
The team found 17 studies with 830 patients aged between 18 and 70. However, none of the studies looked at whether fewer dentists got sick. What they did look at was if the level of harmful germs in two areas was lower (one close to the patient's mouth and one further away). Some studies suggested that a mouth rinse with a germ-killing substance called chlorhexidine might be helpful in lowering germs, compared to not rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar findings for other rinses. However, itâ€™s important to note that the evidence we have is not very convincing, and none of the studies compared different types of mouth rinses directly. They also did not look at whether mouth rinses could help against viruses or fungi, only bacteria. Also, the studies did not provide much helpful information on cost, possible side effects, or how easy it is for patients and dentists to use. This means that it's still unclear whether mouth rinses can help protect dentists from catching diseases from their patients. We need more studies that look directly at this question, using more reliable methods.
