1. Plain Title
Checking the Effectiveness of Different Pain Relief Drugs After Brain Surgery

2. Rationale
After a brain operation, understanding how to keep pain under control is important for recovery. But right now, we don't know which pain relief drugs (medicines) work the best. In this study, we wanted to see how well different drugs help with pain after brain surgery. We were interested in how much extra pain relief was needed, how often headaches occurred after surgery, any side effects like sleepiness, how long patients had to stay in the hospital, and any other side effects. We also wanted to see if these things were different for different groups of people.

3. Trial Design
We did our study by looking at other studies that had been done on this topic. We looked at trials (tests of a drug to see how well it works) that compared different medicines used to prevent pain after brain surgery in adults. We only looked at trials that measured pain with a pain score that has been tested and works well. The studies were found in different databases and were all completed by November 2018. In total, we used information from 42 studies involving 3548 people.

4. Results
Here's what we found: 

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs - these are common pain-relievers like ibuprofen) can decrease pain for up to 24 hours after surgery. But the studies didn't show clearly if the patients needed extra pain relief or had side effects like nausea and vomiting.

- Dexmedetomidine (a medicine that can make you feel sleepy and relaxed) can lower pain for up to 12 hours after surgery. It might also decrease the need for extra pain relief, but the studies weren't clear about other side effects.

- Using 'Scalp blocks' (a local anesthetic given at the scalp, which is the skin on your head) can reduce pain for up to 48 hours after surgery and might lower the need for extra pain relief.

- 'Scalp infiltration' (numbing medicine injected under the skin of the head) might lower pain after surgery, but the studies showed different results. 

- Medicines called gabapentin and pregabalin might lower pain for up to 6 hours after surgery, but not at later times. They might also lower the risk of nausea and vomiting.

- Acetaminophen (a common pain reliever often called Tylenol) did not show benefits for pain relief.
   
The study showed that NSAIDs are the best for pain relief in the first 24 hours after brain surgery. The other treatments we looked at might work as well, but we're not as sure because the evidence was less clear or not very good. However, it seems that some treatments, like scalp blocks and dexmedetomidine, might lower the need for extra pain relief. And gabapentin or pregabalin might decrease the risk of nausea and vomiting. We need to do more studies to be more certain about these results.
