Plain Title: How Non-Medication Treatments May Help Children with Severe Developmental Delays Breathe Better

Rationale: Severe Global Developmental Delay (SGDD) is a condition that seriously affects a child's intellect and physical movement. Children with SGDD cannot perform daily routine tasks on their own and have very limited mobility. This condition does not directly affect lung function, but due to less movement, frailty, uneven bone development, and possibility of food going into the lungs, these children often have breathing issues. These problems can lead to frequent hospital visits and reduce the quality of life for these kids. While there are many treatment approaches, currently we don't have a thorough review of non-medication treatment methods to deal with this issue.

Trial Design: This study looked into the effects of non-medication treatments on improving the breathing issue associated with SGDD in children. For this, important scientific databases were thoroughly checked up until July 2020, where published and ongoing studies were explored and considered to identify treatments that can be included. The studies we took into account were strictly about children up to 18 years old who have SGDD and are experiencing breathing issues. The treatments studied mainly were techniques to clear the airways, assisted coughing, non-invasive ventilation, changes in posture management etc.

Results: We analyzed 15 different studies in this review. These studies dealt with a variety of non-medication treatments with kids having severe neurological condition in various places like home or hospital. Due to the different ways each study was carried out and different outcomes measured, it was not possible to combine the results. Only a few studies were randomized controlled trials- which are gold standard in determining the effectiveness of treatment. 

The studies that were not up to the standard, however did indicate that techniques like non-invasive ventilation, mechanically assisting in coughing, high-frequency chest wall oscillation, positive expiratory pressure, and supportive seating might help these children somewhat. The risks of these treatments were quite low except for one case where a medically unstable child had an incident after mechanically assisted coughing. 

On the other hand, using equipment to position the child during sleep or a brace for the spine seemed to have some negative aspects for a few children. 

Unfortunately, due to the lack of high quality studies, we can't definitively say if these treatments help or not. Therefore, we urge all professionals involved to step up their game when researching this particular matter, to provide better evidence-led treatment for these vulnerable children.
