1. Plain Title: Understanding the Effects of Preventative Treatment for Blood Clots in Adults Undergoing Chemotherapy for Leukemia

2. Rationale: The risk of experiencing a blood clot is higher in adults, particularly those undergoing a type of chemotherapy made from an enzyme called asparaginase. This is used for the treatment of a particular type of leukemia called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Blood clots can cause interruptions or premature discontinuation of important cancer treatment, possibly lowering survival rates. However, the balance between the benefits and risks of preventative treatment for blood clots (thromboprophylaxis) in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase-based therapy is unclear. This is what our research aimed to explore.

3. Trial Design: This study was an extensive review of all previously published studies, conducted on June 02, 2020. Studies were collected from various databases and other sources with no language restrictions. We were looking for studies that compared the use of any preventative treatment for blood clots with a placebo in adults with ALL undergoing asparaginase-based chemotherapy, or those that compared two different preventative treatments for blood clots. Studies focusing on adults 18 years or older were included in the research.

4. Results: Out of 23 studies that met our criteria, only 13 provided enough information for a thorough examination of their methods and results. Unfortunately, we were unable to conclude whether or not preventative treatment for blood clots provides significant benefits because none of the studies were randomized controlled trialsâ€”a high-quality form of research. Two studies were considered for analyzing possible harms from these treatments. One of these trials compared the use of a drug called antithrombin concentrate with no treatment, and the other trial compared the use of a low-weight heparin drug with no treatment. Due to the low certainty of evidence, we found it unclear whether these treatments had any effect on death rates, blood clot-related deaths, major bleeding, and quality of life. Other investigations were also included, but the risk of biased results was high and meaningful data was limited. Hence, we were unable to draw firm conclusions from these studies. Based on the current research, we can't confidently determine whether preventative treatment for blood clots benefits and risks in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase-based chemotherapy. Future research is needed that uses a more rigorous design.
