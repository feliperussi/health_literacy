1. Plain Title: Trying to Predict When Depression Might Return - A Review of Studies

2. Rationale: Sometimes, people who suffer from depression feel better for a while, but then the depression comes back. This return could happen even before they have fully recovered, and we call this a relapse. At other times, they manage to completely recover, but then a new episode of depression starts. That's what we call recurrence. Both relapses and recurrences are common and can lead to worse health and quality of life. They also putt a burden not only on the person with depression but also on society due to the costs of treating and managing it. Scientists have been trying to develop ways to predict who might be at greater risk for such relapses or recurrences. They hope that if we can identify these individuals when they are well (in remission), we could prevent the depression from returning and improve the overall treatment results. 

3. Trial Design: Researchers in this particular study were interested in reviewing and assessing how well past studies did in predicting the return of depression. They looked at scientific literature databases and other sources up until May 2020. They specifically included studies where scientists had developed and tested models to predict the relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults (aged 18 years and over) with remitted depression, in any clinical setting. The trials could involve any number of predictions, and the authors did not put a limit on the comparison model. They focused on studies that gathered and analyzed data in a certain way, and any disagreements were resolved with a third independent author. 

4. Results: The researchers found 11 studies that met their criteria. These studies developed 10 unique models to predict the return of depression. However, several issues limited the usefulness of these past studies. Many of them didn't include enough participants, didn't make the best use of the data, or didn't present adequate information. As a result, ten of the studies were found to be at the high risk of bias. One study that had low risk of bias presented a model predicting the return of depression based on the number of previous depressive episodes, remaining depressive symptoms and severity of the last depressive episode. However, the model was not good at predicting who would experience a return of depression. Overall, the researchers concluded that there could be better ways of predicting the return of depression, and that future studies should follow current best practices. This would improve the quality of the prediction models, and their findings should be reported transparently.
