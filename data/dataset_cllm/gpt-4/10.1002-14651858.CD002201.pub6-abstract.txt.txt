1. Plain Title: Testing Omega-3 Supplements for Cystic Fibrosis Treatment 

2. Rationale: 
Cystic fibrosis is a lifelong liver and lung condition. It can cause lung infections and affect digestion. Some scientific studies suggest that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, found in things like fish oil, might reduce swelling and help manage symptoms of chronic illnesses like cystic fibrosis. So, researchers wanted to see if omega-3 supplements could reduce ill health and death rates in people with cystic fibrosis. They also collected information about any side effects from taking these supplements.

3. Trial Design: 
The researchers searched through studies conducted up until April 2020. They included controlled trials where patients with cystic fibrosis were given either Omega-3 supplements or a placebo pill that has no medical effects. They selected five studies with a total of 106 participants, including both adults and children with cystic fibrosis. These studies lasted from six weeks and up to one year.

4. Results: 
At the end of the study period, the researchers found that the participants who took omega-3 supplements might have experienced some benefits. For instance, in one study, after a year, the people who took the supplement had fewer lung problems, and fewer days where they needed antibiotics compared to the previous year. However, it was unclear whether this improvement was due to the omega-3 supplements because of the very low quality of the evidence.

In terms of side effects, one study reported an increase in diarrhea but other studies showed no difference between placebo and omega-3 groups. Three studies had already made an increase in pancreatic enzyme dose which may have reduced the incidence of diarrhea.

When it came to lung function, one short-term, six-week study seemed to show a slight improvement, but the overall evidence was not strong. No difference was noticed in weight, body mass index (BMI), and fatty acid status in the supplement and placebo groups.

The researchers concluded that while Omega-3 supplements might provide limited benefits, the overall quality of the evidence was low. Therefore, they concluded that there's not enough evidence to recommend a routine use of omega-3 supplements for people with cystic fibrosis. They recommended more large-scale and long-term studies to learn more about the effects of dosage and duration of treatment with Omega-3 supplements for people with cystic fibrosis. They also noted the need to find out the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required when giving omega-3 supplementation.
