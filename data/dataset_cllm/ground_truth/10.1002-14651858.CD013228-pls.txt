Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.
