Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‚Äêterm breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.
