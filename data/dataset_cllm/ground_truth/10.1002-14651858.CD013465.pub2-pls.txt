Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.
