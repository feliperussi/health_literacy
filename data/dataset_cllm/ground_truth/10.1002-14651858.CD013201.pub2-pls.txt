Stem cell‐based therapies for bleeding to the brain (germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage) in newborns born preterm 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain ("germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage")? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ("preterm"), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. Currently no approaches are available to prevent or treat this condition.   
The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding.  
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We did identify five studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question (all were "phase 1" studies).   
We searched for studies that were available up to 7 January 2019.
