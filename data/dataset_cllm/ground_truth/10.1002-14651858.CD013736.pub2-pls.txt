Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.
