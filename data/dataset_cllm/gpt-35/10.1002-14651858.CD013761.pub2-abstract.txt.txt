Plain Title: Beds, Overlays, and Mattresses for Preventing and Treating Pressure Ulcers 

Rationale: 
Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, are injuries to the skin and soft tissues caused by prolonged pressure. Different types of beds, overlays, and mattresses are used to prevent and treat pressure ulcers. This study aimed to summarize the evidence from previous research on the effects of these interventions in reducing the occurrence of pressure ulcers and promoting healing. The study also aimed to compare the effectiveness of different types of support surfaces and rank them according to their efficacy.

Trial Design: 
The study searched the Cochrane Library to find relevant reviews and included randomized controlled trials. The research focused on beds, mattresses, and overlays used for preventing and treating pressure ulcers. The study assessed the effectiveness of these interventions and their probability of being the most effective treatment. The review authors used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. 

Results: 
The overview included six Cochrane Reviews with low or unclear risk of bias. For pressure ulcer prevention, the evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces, and reactive gel surfaces may reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers compared to foam surfaces. However, the certainty of the evidence is low, and it is unclear which treatment is the most effective. 

Regarding the time to pressure ulcer incidence, reactive air surfaces may reduce the risk of developing new pressure ulcers compared to foam surfaces, but the certainty of evidence is low. The ranking of all support surfaces in terms of preventing pressure ulcers is uncertain.

In terms of cost-effectiveness, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers, based on moderate-certainty evidence. 

For pressure ulcer treatment, there is uncertainty about the effects of beds, overlays, and mattresses on ulcer healing. The evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may be more effective in promoting complete healing compared to foam surfaces, but the certainty of evidence is low. 

Finally, reactive air surfaces may lead to faster healing of pressure ulcers compared to foam surfaces in long-term care settings, but again, the certainty of evidence is low. 

Overall, more high-quality research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers. Future studies should consider time-to-event outcomes and minimize bias risks. 

In conclusion, beds, overlays, and mattresses such as reactive air surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces, and reactive gel surfaces may reduce the risk of pressure ulcers and promote healing. However, the certainty of evidence is low, and further research is needed to determine the most effective treatment options.
