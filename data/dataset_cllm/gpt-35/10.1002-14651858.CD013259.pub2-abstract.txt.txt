Plain Title: Benefits of Prehabilitation for Colorectal Cancer Surgery

Rationale:
Colorectal cancer surgery is an important treatment, but it can have negative effects on a patient's health. 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' programs have improved outcomes, but they are mainly used before and after surgery. Prehabilitation involves interventions before surgery to prepare patients and improve their ability to recover after surgery.

Trial Design:
This study looked at the effects of prehabilitation programs on functional capacity, complications, and quality of life in adults undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. The researchers searched for relevant studies and included randomized controlled trials that compared prehabilitation programs to no prehabilitation. They focused on outcomes like physical capacity, postoperative outcomes, and quality of life.

Results:
The study included three trials with 250 participants. These trials took place in specialized care centers and recruited patients over different time periods. The prehabilitation program involved exercise, nutrition, and anxiety reduction techniques. The results showed that prehabilitation may improve functional capacity before and after surgery. It may also lead to fewer complications and emergency department visits. However, there may be a higher rate of re-admissions in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of the evidence is moderate to very low due to the quality of the studies and some limitations.

In conclusion, prehabilitation programs may benefit patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery by improving their functional capacity and reducing complications and emergency visits. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
