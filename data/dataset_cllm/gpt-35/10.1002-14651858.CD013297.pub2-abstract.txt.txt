Plain Title: Surgery versus No Intervention for Epiretinal Membrane: What are the Effects?

Rationale: Epiretinal membrane is an abnormal tissue that forms on the inner surface of the retina, leading to impaired vision. Surgery is a potential treatment option, but its effectiveness compared to no intervention is not well understood. This study aims to determine the effects of surgery for epiretinal membrane and why it is needed.

Trial Design: The study involves a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Participants with mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane and good vision were included. They were randomly assigned to either immediate surgery or watchful waiting with deferred surgery if necessary. The study followed the participants for 12 months to assess the outcomes.

Results: The study included 53 participants and found that at 12 months, the group that underwent immediate surgery had slightly better visual acuity compared to the watchful waiting group. However, the evidence for this finding is limited. The study did not find any significant harms associated with immediate surgery. Overall, the evidence for the benefits of surgery versus no intervention is uncertain, particularly for mild symptomatic cases. Further research is needed to confirm these findings with larger studies and longer follow-up periods.

In summary, this study aimed to determine the effects of surgery for epiretinal membrane compared to no intervention. The results suggest that while immediate surgery may lead to slightly better visual acuity, the evidence is limited and the benefits for mild cases remain uncertain. Further research is needed to provide more conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of surgery and its impact on patients' quality of life.
