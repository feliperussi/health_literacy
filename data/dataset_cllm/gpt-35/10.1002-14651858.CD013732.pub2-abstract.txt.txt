Plain Title: Opioid Analgesics for Newborns on Mechanical Ventilation: Benefits and Limitations

Rationale: Newborn infants in intensive care often undergo mechanical ventilation, which can cause pain and discomfort. Opioid analgesics are drugs that may help reduce pain and improve outcomes for these infants. This study aims to determine the benefits and risks of using opioid analgesics compared to other drugs or no treatment for newborns on mechanical ventilation.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared opioids to placebo or no drug, other opioids, or other pain-relieving drugs for newborns on mechanical ventilation. It included both term and preterm infants and examined the effects of different doses and durations of opioid treatment. The researchers assessed the risk of bias in each trial and used statistical models to analyze the data.

Results: The study included 23 trials with a total of 2023 infants. The use of morphine or fentanyl (opioid analgesics) did not show a clear effect on pain levels in the first 12 hours or between 12 and 48 hours after infusion. There was also no clear evidence that opioids reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation or neonatal mortality. The effects of opioids on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months were uncertain. Limited data were available for comparisons of opioids with other analgesics or other opioids, so no conclusions could be drawn.

Conclusion: Based on the current evidence, it is uncertain whether opioids have a significant effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes for newborns on mechanical ventilation. However, the use of morphine or fentanyl is likely to have little or no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation or neonatal mortality. The limited data available for other comparisons do not allow for any conclusions. Therefore, the use of opioids should be selective and based on clinical judgment and evaluation of pain indicators, taking into account the limitations of pain measurement in newborns.
