Plain Language Summary:
1. Plain Title: Supporting the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during Disease Outbreaks: A Review of Interventions
2. Rationale: Disease epidemics, like COVID-19, can have a negative impact on the mental health of healthcare workers. They may experience depression, anxiety, stress, and other problems that can affect their work. This study aimed to determine if interventions could help improve the mental health and resilience of healthcare workers during and after disease outbreaks.
3. Trial Design: The researchers searched different databases for studies from 2002 onwards that investigated interventions for healthcare workers during disease outbreaks. They included studies that used different types of interventions and measured mental health and resilience. They analyzed the data and identified barriers and facilitators to implementing these interventions.
4. Results: The researchers found 16 studies that included interventions for healthcare workers during disease outbreaks, such as training, psychological support, and multifaceted interventions. One study showed that training healthcare workers to provide psychological first aid had a small impact on reducing burnout. The researchers also identified barriers and facilitators to implementing these interventions. Factors like lack of awareness, resources, and equipment were barriers, while adaptability, effective communication, and supportive learning environments were facilitators. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence about which interventions are most beneficial for healthcare workers' mental health. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions during disease outbreaks. Factors influencing implementation should be considered.
