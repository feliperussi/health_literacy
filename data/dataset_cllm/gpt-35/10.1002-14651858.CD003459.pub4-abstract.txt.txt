Plain Title: Methotrexate for Crohn's Disease: Induction of Remission and Safety

Rationale: Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract and can have a negative impact on patients' lives. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat Crohn's disease, but they have side effects and many patients relapse when they stop taking them. Methotrexate, a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has been considered as an alternative treatment for Crohn's disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of methotrexate in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease, with or without other medications.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials that compared methotrexate to a placebo or other active treatment in adult patients with active Crohn's disease. The researchers searched for relevant studies and analyzed the data on an intention-to-treat basis. The quality of the included studies was assessed, and the main outcome measures were the failure to enter remission and withdrawal from steroid treatment.

Results: The study included seven trials with a total of 495 patients. The quality of evidence was generally low due to limited data and lack of blinding. Lower dose oral methotrexate did not show significant benefits compared to placebo or other medications such as 6-mercaptopurine. However, a large trial using intramuscular methotrexate showed a significant benefit in inducing remission and complete withdrawal from steroids compared to placebo. Adverse events were more common in methotrexate-treated patients, but serious adverse events were not significantly different between the groups. Common side effects included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, and headache.

Conclusion: The evidence suggests that higher dose intramuscular methotrexate can help induce remission and withdrawal from steroid treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of lower dose oral methotrexate and its comparison to other medications like azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Adding methotrexate to infliximab therapy did not provide additional benefits, but further studies are needed to understand the role of methotrexate in combination with other biological therapies.
