Plain Title: Using Combined Inhalers for Mild Asthma: Results and Benefits

Rationale:
Asthma is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, including those with mild symptoms. The main treatment for asthma involves using inhalers that contain beta₂‐agonists and inhaled corticosteroids. However, many people have trouble sticking to their regular medication schedule, which can increase the risk of worsening symptoms and complications. To simplify treatment and improve adherence, researchers have developed combined inhalers that contain both a steroid and a fast-acting beta₂‐agonist. These inhalers have been shown to be effective for moderate asthma, but their potential benefits for those with mild asthma need further investigation.

Trial Design:
We conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using a single combined inhaler (containing a fast-acting beta₂‐agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid) on an as-needed basis for people with mild asthma. We searched various databases and collected data from six studies, involving a total of 9,657 participants, with an average age of 36 to 43 years. The study lasted for at least 12 weeks, and we compared the use of the combined inhaler with no treatment, placebo, and other standard asthma medications.

Results:
The results of our study showed that using the combined inhaler on an as-needed basis reduced the number of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids among participants compared to those using fast-acting bronchodilators alone. This means that fewer people experienced severe asthma attacks and needed additional medication to control their symptoms. Additionally, the combined inhaler also reduced the odds of asthma-related hospital admissions or visits to the emergency department or urgent care clinic. It was found to be as effective as regular use of inhaled corticosteroids in preventing exacerbations and improving overall asthma management. Participants using the combined inhaler had lower exposure to systemic corticosteroids and a possible reduction in adverse events.

Conclusions:
Based on our findings, using a combined inhaler that contains a fast-acting beta₂‐agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid on an as-needed basis is an effective and safe option for adults and adolescents with mild asthma. It reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks, hospital admissions, and exposure to systemic corticosteroids. The use of the combined inhaler is as effective as regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and is unlikely to increase the risk of adverse events. Further research is needed to determine the use of this treatment in children under 12 years old, explore other combinations of inhalers, and assess long-term outcomes beyond the study period of 52 weeks.
