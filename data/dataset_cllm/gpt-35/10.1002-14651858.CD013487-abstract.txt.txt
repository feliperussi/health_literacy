Plain Title: Comparing Treatments for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

Rationale: Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow. It is a serious condition that accounts for about two percent of all cancers. The first treatments for people who cannot have a transplant are combinations of drugs like bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide. However, these medicines are not easily accessible in many countries. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of different combinations of these drugs for adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The goal is to gather evidence to support the inclusion of these medicines in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines.

Trial Design: The study involved searching for previous research on this topic and analyzing the data. We looked at randomized controlled trials that compared different combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide for adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who cannot have a transplant. The study included a total of 25 studies with 11,403 participants and 21 different treatment regimens. The duration of treatment varied between a specified number of cycles and continuous therapy until the disease worsened or the person could not tolerate the treatment.

Results: The study found that certain combinations of drugs increased overall survival compared to the standard treatment. Treatments with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably improved survival rates compared to the usual treatment, with VRDc showing the greatest benefit. The study also found that these treatments increased the amount of time without disease progression. However, the treatments also had a higher risk of adverse events, such as polyneuropathies. Some combinations had a greater risk of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation. It is important for further research to be conducted to better understand the safety and effectiveness of these treatments.

In conclusion, this study compared different combinations of drugs for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. It found that some combinations improved overall survival and progression-free survival. However, these treatments also increased the risk of adverse events and treatment discontinuation. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of these treatments compared to standard treatment.
