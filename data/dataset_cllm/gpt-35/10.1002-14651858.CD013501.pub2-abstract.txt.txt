Plain Title: Vegan Diets and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention

Rationale: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a serious health condition that is influenced by diet. Vegan diets, which exclude meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and honey, have become popular and there is a need to understand their potential in preventing CVD. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of following a vegan diet for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. The study was conducted because it is important to find ways to prevent CVD and vegan diets may have the potential to help.

Trial Design: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a vegan diet on CVD prevention. The researchers searched for relevant studies in various electronic databases and clinical trial registries. They included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving healthy adults, adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention), and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). The vegan diet intervention could involve dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group either received no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. The included studies had follow-up periods of 12 weeks or more.

Results: Thirteen RCTs and eight ongoing trials were included in this study. Most trials focused on primary prevention. The results showed that following a vegan diet may lead to a small reduction in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, a very small decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and a very small increase in triglyceride levels. However, the changes in HDL and triglyceride levels were unexpected. There was not enough evidence to conclude that the vegan diet intervention had an effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

For secondary prevention, there was a lack of evidence to determine the effects of a vegan diet on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions. Only one trial contributed to this comparison.

Overall, the studies included in this review were small and had few participants in each comparison group. None of the studies reported on clinical events related to CVD. Therefore, there is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan diets on CVD risk factors. However, the ongoing studies identified in this review will provide additional evidence, particularly in the context of primary prevention. The evidence for secondary prevention is limited. It is important to conduct more research to better understand the potential benefits of vegan diets in preventing CVD.
