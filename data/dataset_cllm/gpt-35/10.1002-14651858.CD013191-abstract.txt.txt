Plain Title: Use of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy for Skin Cancer Detection

Rationale: Skin cancer is a serious condition that can have severe consequences if not detected and treated early. There are different types of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and melanoma. BCC is usually localized and less aggressive, while cSCC and melanoma have a higher risk of spreading and leading to death. Detecting skin cancer accurately is important to guide appropriate treatment and improve outcomes. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a technique that can help identify cancers that may not require a biopsy, particularly in cases of suspected BCC. However, there is a need to determine the accuracy of RCM compared to standard methods of inspection and diagnosis.

Trial Design: This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of RCM for detecting BCC, cSCC, or any skin cancer in adults with suspicious or difficult-to-diagnose lesions. The researchers conducted a comprehensive search of various databases for relevant studies. They included studies that evaluated the accuracy of RCM alone or compared it to visual inspection or dermoscopy. The data was extracted and analyzed, taking into account the quality of the studies and the experience of the observers.

Results: The review included 10 studies reporting on 11 study cohorts. RCM was found to be more sensitive but less specific for detecting BCC in cases of equivocal lesions compared to suspicious lesions. However, the results were uncertain due to the wide confidence intervals. In studies of equivocal lesions, applying the results to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions resulted in missing 9 BCCs and having 128 false-positive results. There was also evidence of melanomas being mistaken for BCCs in some cases. The data for detecting cSCC was limited, so no summary sensitivity and specificity could be estimated.

The results of the study suggest that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of RCM for diagnosing BCC or cSCC. However, RCM may have a role in clinical practice to avoid unnecessary biopsies in cases where BCC is highly suspected. Further research is needed to assess the potential misclassification of other skin cancers, such as melanoma, as BCCs. It is also important to compare RCM to standard clinical practice to determine its effectiveness.

In conclusion, while RCM shows promise as a diagnostic tool for skin cancer, more research is needed to establish its accuracy and compare it to existing methods used by healthcare providers.
