Plain Title: Using Antiemetics to Prevent Nausea and Vomiting from Opioids in Acute Care

Rationale: Patients often experience nausea and vomiting when taking opioids for pain in the hospital. Antiemetic medications can help reduce these side effects. However, it is important to understand how well these medications work and if they have any risks before using them regularly. This study looked at different trials to compare the effectiveness and safety of antiemetics versus a placebo or standard care in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by opioids.

Trial Design: This study included adults aged 16 years or older who were receiving opioids through an IV in the hospital. The researchers searched various databases and clinical trial registries to find relevant studies. They evaluated the quality of each study and collected data on nausea, vomiting, and any adverse events. They presented the results using different measures, such as risk ratios and mean differences.

Results: Three studies involving 527 participants were included in this review. All of the studies used a medication called metoclopramide as the antiemetic and compared it to a placebo. None of the studies compared the antiemetic to standard care or other medications. The results showed that metoclopramide did not significantly reduce vomiting or nausea compared to the placebo. There was also no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups. However, metoclopramide did slightly reduce the severity of nausea. The certainty of these findings was low, meaning more research is needed to confirm them. The studies were at low risk of bias for most components.

Conclusion: Based on the evidence from these studies, there is no strong evidence that using metoclopramide before receiving IV opioids in the hospital reduces the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication. The difference in nausea severity was not significant and may not have much clinical importance. The certainty of these conclusions is low, so more research is needed. Future studies should focus on specific patient populations and evaluate other antiemetic medications that were not included in these trials.
