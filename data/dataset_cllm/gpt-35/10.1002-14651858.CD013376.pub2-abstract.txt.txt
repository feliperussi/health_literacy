Plain Title: The Effects of Education on Aflatoxin Exposure and Child Growth in Low-Income Countries

Rationale: Aflatoxins are harmful substances found in contaminated food crops like maize and groundnuts. These toxins can have negative effects on human health, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Studies have shown that exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood can impact the growth of infants and young children. This study aimed to assess if educational interventions during the post-harvest period could reduce aflatoxin exposure and improve growth outcomes for infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women.

Trial Design: The study involved randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials. The interventions focused on agricultural and nutritional education aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake. The participants included pregnant and lactating women, infants, and young children in low-income countries. The study lasted for a duration of five to nine months.

Results: The study included three recent trials conducted in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. The interventions involved agricultural education and post-harvest technologies compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The trials included a total of at least 979 mother-child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. The results showed that providing agricultural education to farmers, including demonstrations on post-harvest practices, may improve the weight-for-age of infants from these households. The education interventions resulted in an average increase of 0.57 in the weight-for-age z-score of infants compared to those in households receiving routine agricultural support. Additionally, the interventions may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in these households by 6.7%.

The study did not find any significant effects of nutritional education on pre- and postnatal growth. No unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education were reported.

In conclusion, the evidence on the effects of educational interventions on child growth in low-income countries is limited. However, the study suggests that agricultural education interventions, specifically focusing on post-harvest practices, may have a positive impact on the weight-for-age of infants. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of nutritional education and to gather more evidence on the long-term benefits of educational interventions in reducing aflatoxin exposure and promoting healthy child growth in low-income countries.
