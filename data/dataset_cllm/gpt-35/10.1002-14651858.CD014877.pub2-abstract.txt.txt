Plain Title: Perspectives on Low-Complexity Tests for Tuberculosis: Implications for Implementation and Equity

Rationale:
Tuberculosis is a serious health condition that can cause illness and even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated. However, current diagnostics methods are often inaccessible, leading to delayed diagnosis and ineffective treatment. Low-complexity nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been developed to address this problem. These tests are designed to be simple and accessible, with the potential to provide accurate and rapid results for tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis. This study sought to understand the perspectives and experiences of both patients and healthcare professionals regarding the use of these tests, in order to identify barriers to effective implementation and ensure equitable access to testing.

Trial Design:
To conduct this study, researchers reviewed existing studies that used qualitative methods to collect data. They searched multiple databases for studies conducted from 2007 to 2021. The studies included in the review focused on the perspectives and experiences of users and potential users of low-complexity NAATs for diagnosing tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis. The participants included people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis, healthcare providers, laboratory technicians, and program officers and staff. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, where tuberculosis burden is high. The researchers analyzed the data and categorized the findings into different themes.

Results:
The review included 32 studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries with high tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis burdens. The findings revealed several key aspects. People with tuberculosis valued receiving an accurate diagnosis without delays and at a low cost. Healthcare providers emphasized the importance of accuracy, confidence in the test results, and rapid turnaround times. Laboratory professionals appreciated the improved ease of use and biosafety of low-complexity NAATs. However, the studies also identified challenges impeding the effective use of these tests. These challenges included fear, stigma, and cost concerns among patients and healthcare workers, as well as delays at different steps of the diagnostic process due to poor sample quality and logistical issues. The studies also highlighted concerns about equitable access to testing, including funding, conflicts of interest, eligibility restrictions, and lack of facilities in the community. Overall, the review concluded that low-complexity diagnostics alone cannot address the underlying issues of weak infrastructure, limited resources, and lack of skilled professionals. Implementation of these tests must address these challenges and ensure equitable access to resources.

In conclusion, this review highlights the need to address the challenges associated with implementing low-complexity tests for tuberculosis. While these tests have the potential to improve diagnostics, they cannot overcome the fundamental barriers of weak infrastructure and limited resources. Efforts should be made to strengthen healthcare systems, collect and utilize data effectively, and ensure equitable distribution of resources to enable the successful implementation of these tests.
