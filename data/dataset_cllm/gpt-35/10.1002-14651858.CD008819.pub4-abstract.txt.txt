Plain Title: Effectiveness of Compression Stockings for Varicose Veins Treatment
Rationale: Varicose veins are a common condition that can cause discomfort and affect the quality of life for patients. Compression stockings are often used as a first-line treatment, but it is important to determine if they are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment for varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration.
Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials involving individuals diagnosed with primary trunk varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration. The participants were assessed using different types and pressures of compression stockings. The study duration varied among the trials.
Results: The study included 13 trials with 1021 participants. For compression stockings compared to no treatment or placebo stockings, subjective improvement in symptoms was reported. Physiological measures such as ankle circumference and oedema showed no significant differences except for reduced oedema in the stocking group. Side effects were minimal, with itching and irritation being the most common. Compliance varied among studies, with some reporting high dropout rates due to discomfort. Overall, there was no clear difference in quality of life between the stocking and placebo groups. When comparing different types of compression stockings, there was subjective improvement in symptoms reported. Physiological measures showed no clear differences between study groups. Side effects were minimal, and compliance rates were similar. Discomfort was the main reason for preferring one type of stocking over another. However, no conclusive results were found regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings.
Conclusion: The current evidence does not provide high-certainty evidence on the effectiveness of compression stockings as the sole and initial treatment for varicose veins in individuals without healed or active venous ulceration. Further research is needed, particularly large randomized controlled trials, to evaluate the efficacy of compression stockings in patients with trunk varices. If beneficial, future studies can explore the most effective length and pressure for compression stockings.
