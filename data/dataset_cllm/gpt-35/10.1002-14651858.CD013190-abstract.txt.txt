Plain Title: Reflectance Confocal Microscopy: A Potential Tool for Diagnosing Melanoma

Rationale: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer with a high mortality rate. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving survival. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a diagnostic tool that can help in the detection of melanoma. This study aims to determine the accuracy of RCM in detecting melanoma and compare its effectiveness with dermoscopy.

Trial Design: The study involved a comprehensive search of various databases to gather relevant information. The researchers analyzed studies that evaluated RCM alone or in comparison to dermoscopy. They collected data such as sensitivities and specificities of the tests and used statistical models for analysis. The researchers also investigated the impact of using a specific RCM algorithm and in-person test interpretation.

Results: The study identified 18 publications reporting on 19 study cohorts and a total of 2838 lesions. The analysis found that RCM was more accurate than dermoscopy in detecting melanoma, especially in cases where the diagnosis was difficult. For lesions suspicious for melanoma, RCM had a specificity of 82%, compared to dermoscopy's 42%. This means that RCM can help reduce unnecessary surgeries by 280 cases compared to dermoscopy, while missing only 30 melanomas. In cases of equivocal lesions, RCM had a specificity of 86%, compared to dermoscopy's 49%. This led to a reduction of 296 unnecessary surgeries with RCM, with 20 melanomas missed by both tests. The Pellacani RCM score at a threshold of three or greater showed a sensitivity of 92% for RCM and 72% for dermoscopy.

Conclusion: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) has the potential to be a valuable tool in diagnosing melanoma, particularly in cases where visual inspection and dermoscopy alone may be challenging. The study findings suggest that RCM is more sensitive and specific than dermoscopy. However, further confirmation through prospective studies in real-world settings is necessary to fully establish RCM's effectiveness in a representative population.
