Plain Title: Study on Dental Imaging Methods for Detecting Tooth Decay

Rationale: When tooth decay is detected and diagnosed early, it can be treated with less invasive procedures, thus preserving more of the tooth and reducing the need for costly treatments. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of different dental imaging methods in detecting early tooth decay that has not yet formed cavities.

Trial Design: The researchers conducted a thorough search of databases and included studies that compared various dental imaging methods with reference standards such as histology and enhanced visual examination. They included both in vitro and in vivo studies, and analyzed the data using statistical methods.

Results: The study included data from 77 studies, reporting a total of 15,518 tooth sites. The most commonly used imaging methods were analog and digital radiographs. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of all imaging methods combined were 47% and 88% respectively. In simpler terms, this means that out of 1000 tooth surfaces with early tooth decay, about 337 were wrongly classified as healthy, while 43 healthy surfaces were incorrectly classified as decayed. Different imaging methods had varying levels of accuracy, with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) showing the highest sensitivity and analog radiographs showing the highest specificity.

The researchers identified limitations in the design and execution of the included studies, which led to low-certainty evidence. Despite these limitations, the study suggests that imaging methods may have lower sensitivity but acceptable specificity in detecting early tooth decay. This means that some cases of early decay may be missed, but the detection of decay is generally reliable. The use of non-invasive treatments, such as fluoride, may still be effective in managing early decay.

In conclusion, CBCT has shown superior sensitivity but its use is limited to certain dental practitioners due to radiation dose and potential artifacts. The study highlights the need for future research to compare the accuracy of different methods in a clinical setting and improve the reference standards used.
