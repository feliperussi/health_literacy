Plain Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Tube Feeding for Severe Dementia Patients

Rationale: People with severe dementia often face difficulties with eating and swallowing or have reduced food and fluid intake. The use of tube feeding as a solution for these problems is unclear. Some guidelines question the benefits and potential risks of tube feeding. This study aimed to assess whether tube feeding is effective and safe for individuals with severe dementia who have eating and swallowing difficulties or poor nutritional intake.

Trial Design: The study looked at previous research on tube feeding and severe dementia. The researchers searched different databases for relevant studies. They included randomized controlled trials and controlled non-randomized studies involving adults of any age who had a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia. These individuals had severe cognitive and functional impairment, as well as poor nutritional intake. The researchers evaluated the effectiveness and complications of tube feeding through different methods compared to standard care or enhanced standard care. The primary outcomes measured were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers.

Results: The study found no eligible randomized controlled trials, but it did include fourteen controlled non-randomized studies. The findings showed that there was no evidence that tube feeding improves survival time, quality of life, reduces pain, or mortality. It also did not improve nourishment or family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, burden, or satisfaction with care. There were some indications of harm, such as a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, as well as clearly defined interventions and measuring all relevant outcomes.

In conclusion, based on the available evidence, tube feeding does not appear to provide significant benefits for individuals with severe dementia. It may even pose risks such as pressure ulcers. Further research is needed to better understand this topic and improve the quality of care for individuals with severe dementia.
