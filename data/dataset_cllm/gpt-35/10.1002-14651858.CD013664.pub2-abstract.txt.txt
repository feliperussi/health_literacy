1. Plain Title: Adjunctive Therapy for Trabeculectomy Survival after Cataract Surgery: A Review
2. Rationale: Cataracts, a common vision problem, can develop after trabeculectomy surgery for glaucoma. Cataracts cause symptoms like blurred vision and difficulty seeing at night. While cataract surgery can improve vision, it may also increase the risk of trabeculectomy failure. We need to find ways to improve the success of trabeculectomy after cataract surgery.
3. Trial Design: We searched various databases for studies investigating additional treatments during cataract surgery to improve the survival of trabeculectomy. We included randomized controlled trials involving patients who previously had trabeculectomy and were undergoing cataract surgery. These trials compared different therapies aimed at promoting wound healing during cataract surgery. The primary outcome measured was trabeculectomy failure at 6 to 12 months after cataract surgery, and we also looked at other factors such as eye pressure, medications, bleb appearance, visual field progression, and any complications.
4. Results: Unfortunately, we did not find any randomized controlled trials that examined the use of adjunctive therapies to improve the survival of trabeculectomy after cataract surgery. Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the role of these therapies in promoting the success of trabeculectomy.
