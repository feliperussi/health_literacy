Plain Title: Effectiveness of Communication Aids for People with Artificial Airways

Rationale: People who require an artificial airway often struggle to communicate effectively, which can cause distress and impact the quality of care. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of communication aids for these individuals. The main goal was to determine the proportion of people who could use a communication aid to express their symptoms, needs, or preferences, or produce intelligible words using a voice-enabling aid. The study aimed to investigate various aspects such as time to communication, perceptions of communication, communication quality, quality of life, psychological distress, length of stay and costs, and adverse events. It was important to understand which communication aids are most effective in order to improve care for these patients.

Trial Design: The study included 11 different studies involving a total of 1931 participants in intensive care units. The participants had artificial airways and were randomly assigned to different groups. Some groups used non-vocal communication aids, while others used voice-enabling aids. The effectiveness of these aids was compared to usual care, which involved either no aid or the use of various communication aids. The study followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by two review authors.

Results: Overall, the study found that the evidence regarding the effectiveness of communication aids was very low due to various factors such as imprecision, heterogeneous measurements, inconsistent results, and high or unclear risk of bias in most studies. None of the non-vocal aid studies reported the primary outcome. Uncertainty remains regarding the effects of early use of voice-enabling aids on the ability to produce intelligible words. The effects of non-vocal aids on patient satisfaction were also uncertain. Quality of life outcomes for non-vocal aids were not reported. There was some indication that early use of voice-enabling aids may have a positive impact on quality of life and psychological distress, but the certainty of the evidence was very low. Voice-enabling aids were found to have little or no impact on ICU length of stay, while the effects of non-vocal aids on length of stay remained unclear. The studies reported similar rates of adverse events between different communication aids, but uncertainty remains regarding any harm associated with their use.

Conclusion: Due to the lack of high-quality studies, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity, the evidence is insufficient to guide the use of specific communication aids for people with artificial airways. Further research is needed to develop a core outcome measurement set that can effectively assess the effectiveness of these aids.
