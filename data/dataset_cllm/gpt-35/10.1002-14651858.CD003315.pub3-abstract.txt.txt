Plain Language Summary:

1. Plain Title: Feeding Interventions for Babies with Cleft Lip and Palate
2. Rationale: Babies born with cleft lip and cleft palate often experience feeding difficulties and have slower growth compared to other babies. This study looked at different feeding methods and devices to see if they could improve growth and development in these babies.
3. Trial Design: The study included five different research trials with a total of 292 babies. The babies were randomly assigned to different feeding interventions, such as using squeezable or rigid bottles, breastfeeding or spoon-feeding, and using a maxillary plate or not. The study lasted up to 6 months from birth.
4. Results: The study found that there were no significant differences in growth outcomes between the different bottle types. However, the use of squeezable bottles was found to be easier for babies with clefts. Additionally, breastfeeding was shown to have a positive effect on weight gain after cleft surgery compared to spoon-feeding. The study did not find any evidence to support the use of maxillary plates for growth in babies with cleft palate. The study was unable to assess the use of any types of maternal advice or support for these babies.

Overall, this study suggests that using squeezable bottles may be beneficial for babies with clefts, and that breastfeeding after cleft surgery could lead to better weight gain. However, more research is needed to understand the role of maternal advice and support for these babies.
