Plain Title: Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation for Hip and Knee Joint Replacement: Improving Activity and Participation

Rationale:
Joint replacements are common procedures used to treat severe joint pain and disability caused by hip or knee joint problems. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process for patients undergoing joint replacement. The purpose of this study is to examine the evidence supporting the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in improving activity and participation for adults who have undergone hip or knee joint replacement surgery. This study is needed to determine if rehabilitation can help patients regain their ability to perform daily activities and participate fully in their lives after joint replacement.

Trial Design:
This study involved a search of various medical databases to find relevant research articles published up to September 2006. The selection criteria for the trials included in this study were randomized controlled trials that compared multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs with standard post-operative care following hip or knee replacement surgery. The outcome measures used in the trials focused on the activity and participation levels of patients according to the International Classification of Functioning, Health, and Disability. The data from the included trials was independently analyzed by four authors to assess its quality and reliability.

Results:
Five trials involving a total of 619 participants were included in this study. Two trials focused on inpatient rehabilitation programs, while three trials examined home-based rehabilitation settings. No trials addressed outpatient center programs. Due to differences in study design and outcomes, it was not possible to combine the data from these trials. However, the methodological assessment showed that all trials were of low quality. In inpatient settings, early rehabilitation and the use of clinical pathways led to quicker achievement of functional milestones such as independence in daily activities and faster recovery. Home-based multidisciplinary care improved functional gain and quality of life in the medium term and reduced hospital stay. However, no trials addressed longer-term outcomes for patients who underwent hip replacement only.

Based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that multidisciplinary rehabilitation following hip or knee joint replacement surgery can improve activity and participation levels for patients. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, frequency, and long-term effects of rehabilitation, as well as the associated social costs. Future studies should focus on improving the quality and scientific rigor of clinical trials, as well as the use of standardized outcome measures to allow for more meaningful statistical analysis.
