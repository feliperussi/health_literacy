Plain Title: Effect of Maternal Postures in Labor on Health Outcomes for Mother and Baby

Rationale: 
During labor, some babies may be in a difficult position, which can cause problems for both the mother and the baby. We wanted to see if certain positions that the mother can be in during labor might improve the outcomes for both. This study is important because it helps us understand if these positions can help during labor and delivery.

Trial Design: 
We looked at different studies that tested the effects of specific positions for mothers with babies in a difficult position during labor. The studies included women who were having a baby and had confirmed through ultrasound or examination that their baby was in a difficult position. The studies compared different positions that the mother could be in during labor. We collected information from eight studies with a total of 1766 women. 

Results: 
The studies found that using the hands and knees position or lateral positions during labor did not have a significant effect on the mother's and baby's health outcomes. This means that these positions did not greatly improve or worsen the outcomes for the mother or baby. The evidence from these studies was of low or very low certainty, which means we are not completely sure of the results. However, if a woman feels comfortable in these positions during labor, there is no reason why she should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to explore other positions, such as semi-prone positions or lateral positions with hip hyperflexion, and to test interventions that last longer or are used in the early second stage of labor. These studies will help us understand if different positions or interventions can be more effective in improving outcomes for mothers and babies in difficult labor positions.
