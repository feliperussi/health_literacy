Plain Title: Noninvasive Ventilation for Breathing Problems After Abdominal Surgery

Rationale:
After abdominal surgery, many patients experience a complication called acute respiratory failure. This can cause serious health problems and even death. We wanted to compare two treatments for acute respiratory failure - noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and standard oxygen therapy - to see which one is better for patients. Noninvasive ventilation has been proven to help patients with breathing problems, and we wanted to see if it could also help patients after abdominal surgery.

Trial Design:
We searched different databases for studies on noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. We found two studies that involved a total of 269 participants. The participants were mostly men and had an average age of 65 years. In both studies, some participants received noninvasive ventilation while others received standard oxygen therapy. We evaluated the quality of the studies to make sure they were reliable.

Results:
The results showed that noninvasive ventilation using CPAP or bilevel NPPV can reduce the need for tracheal intubation after abdominal surgery. This means that patients who received noninvasive ventilation were less likely to require a breathing tube. Noninvasive ventilation may also shorten the time patients spend in the ICU. However, we found no difference in mortality rates or hospital stay between the two treatments. The studies did not provide enough evidence to determine the effect of noninvasive ventilation on other complications such as leakage or infections. One study suggested that bilevel NPPV can improve blood gas levels and blood pH in patients.

In conclusion, this review suggests that noninvasive ventilation using CPAP or bilevel NPPV is effective and safe for treating acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.
