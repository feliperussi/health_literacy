Plain Title: 
Effectiveness of Treatments for People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Comorbidities: A Review

Rationale:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by difficulty breathing, coughing, and frequent flare-ups. People with COPD often have other long-term health conditions, known as comorbidities, which can increase their risk of complications and mortality. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of different interventions tailored to COPD patients with comorbidities and to explore the experiences of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals in managing multiple conditions.

Trial Design:
The study involved searching various databases and registries to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and qualitative studies related to COPD interventions. The selected RCTs compared tailored interventions for COPD with usual care or other interventions. Quantitative data from the RCTs were analyzed using established methods, and the quality of evidence was assessed. The primary outcomes of interest were quality of life and exacerbations.

Results:
Quantitative studies: The analysis included seven studies involving 1,197 participants. The interventions tested included telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimization, water-based exercise, and case management. The duration of the trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, and the participants' ages and COPD severity varied. The evidence from these studies was of moderate to very low certainty, mainly due to study quality and imprecision of results.

Compared to usual care, tailored pulmonary rehabilitation was associated with improved quality of life and COPD assessment test scores at 52 weeks. Telehealth interventions also showed promise in improving COPD assessment test scores. Case management did not significantly affect exacerbations compared to usual care. Pulmonary rehabilitation, water-based exercise, and multicomponent interventions improved the six-minute walk distance. A multicomponent intervention may also reduce hospital admissions. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about mortality.

Qualitative studies: One qualitative study explored the perspectives of patients, researchers, and healthcare professionals involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes emerged, including health status, concerns, equipment reliability, self-efficacy, and changes in healthcare use. However, the overall certainty of the qualitative evidence was very low.

Conclusion:
Due to limited and diverse trial data, this review was unable to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the effectiveness of interventions for COPD patients with comorbidities. Pulmonary rehabilitation and multicomponent interventions showed potential in improving quality of life and functional status, but the evidence was limited. More robust studies are needed, including larger trials that consider individual patient data, to better understand the effects of treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities.
