Plain Title: Discontinuing Antipsychotic Drugs in Older People with Dementia: Effects on Behavior and Safety

Rationale: Antipsychotic drugs are commonly used to treat behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia. However, their long-term use may not be effective and can potentially cause harm, including higher mortality rates. Current guidelines recommend attempting to withdraw antipsychotic drugs when behavioral strategies fail. However, healthcare professionals and family members may be hesitant to do so due to concerns about symptom deterioration. This study aims to evaluate the success of antipsychotic drug withdrawal in older individuals with dementia, as well as the different strategies for withdrawal and their effects on behavior and safety.

Trial Design: This study examined randomized, controlled trials that compared antipsychotic drug withdrawal strategies to the continuation of antipsychotic treatment in individuals with dementia who had been taking antipsychotic drugs for at least three months. A total of 10 studies involving 632 participants were included in the analysis. The trials were conducted in community settings and nursing homes, and various types and doses of antipsychotic drugs were discontinued using both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules.

Results: The findings of this study suggest that discontinuing antipsychotic drugs in older individuals with dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms may have little or no important effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms. There is low-quality evidence to support the success of antipsychotic drug withdrawal in these individuals. Additionally, discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function, adverse events, or quality of life. However, further research is needed to determine the effects of withdrawal on mortality rates. People with psychosis, aggression, or agitation who respond well to long-term antipsychotic treatment, as well as those with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline, may benefit from continuing antipsychotic treatment. On the other hand, discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs may reduce agitation in individuals with mild neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline. It is important to note that these conclusions are based on limited evidence, and more studies are required to fully understand the benefits and risks of antipsychotic drug withdrawal in individuals with dementia and different levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

In conclusion, this study indicates that antipsychotic drugs may be successfully discontinued in older individuals with dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms who have been taking these drugs for at least three months. Discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms. However, the decision to withdraw antipsychotic treatment should be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration the specific symptoms and needs of each patient. More research is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and risks associated with antipsychotic drug withdrawal in individuals with dementia.
