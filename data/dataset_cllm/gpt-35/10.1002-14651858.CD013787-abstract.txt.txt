Plain Title: Use of Routine Laboratory Tests to Detect COVID-19

Rationale: We conducted a study to determine if routine laboratory tests can accurately detect COVID-19. Currently, specific diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are not always available or provide timely results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin are commonly used to assess a patient's clinical status. These tests can help prioritize individuals for different levels of treatment, especially when resources are limited.

Trial Design: Our study involved analyzing various research studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory tests for COVID-19. We included both case-control designs and consecutive series of patients. The reference standard for diagnosis was the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is commonly used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed a total of 21 studies, including 14,126 COVID-19 patients and 56,585 non-COVID-19 patients.

Results: Our findings showed that no single routine laboratory test is reliable enough to accurately confirm or rule out COVID-19 on its own. However, some tests did demonstrate potential. The three tests with the highest sensitivity and specificity were an increase in interleukin-6, an increase in C-reactive protein, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. These tests can provide indications about a patient's general health status and identify inflammatory processes, but they should not be used as standalone diagnostic tests for COVID-19.

Conclusion: Our study highlights the limitations of using routine laboratory tests as sole diagnostic tools for COVID-19. These tests can be helpful in understanding a patient's overall health and identifying potential inflammation, but they cannot definitively confirm or rule out COVID-19. It is important to consider the specific settings and populations in which these tests were conducted, as future studies should explore their effectiveness in non-hospitalized individuals with milder symptoms.
