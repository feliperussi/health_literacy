Plain Title: Non-Drug Therapy for Stuttering in Children

Rationale: Stuttering, or stammering, is a common communication disorder that affects a child's ability to speak fluently. It can cause repetitions of sounds or words, and non-verbal behaviors like tension in the face or eye blinks. Stuttering can also affect social and emotional functioning. This study aims to understand the effects of non-drug therapies for stuttering in children under six years old. The researchers want to see if these therapies can improve speech, communication attitudes, quality of life, and if there are any potential negative effects. This study is important because it can help us find effective treatments for stuttering in young children.

Trial Design: The study used a method called a randomized controlled trial. They included children aged six and under who stuttered and divided them into two groups. One group received a therapy called the Lidcombe Program, while the other group did not receive any treatment. The Lidcombe Program involves visits to a speech and language therapist and teaches parents how to continue the treatment at home. The study lasted for different durations, ranging from 12 weeks to nine months, depending on the specific program. The researchers collected data on speech outcomes, such as stuttering frequency, and considered factors like the child's age, IQ, severity of stuttering, gender, and time since the stuttering started.

Results: The study found that the Lidcombe Program resulted in lower stuttering frequency compared to the group that did not receive treatment. However, it's important to note that the complete intervention program takes one to two years to complete, so none of the participants finished the program during the study. The researchers also found that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children. Only one study reported long-term outcomes, and further research is needed to fully understand the effects of non-drug therapies for stuttering.

In conclusion, this study suggests that the Lidcombe Program may be helpful in reducing stuttering frequency and improving speech efficiency in children up to six years old. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore other non-drug therapies for stuttering.
