Plain Title: Treatment Options for Finger Injuries

Rationale: 
Hyperextension injuries to the finger joints can cause pain and limited movement. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of non-surgical treatments for these types of injuries. The study aimed to understand how immobilization or early motion could help patients recover. 

Trial Design: 
The study involved reviewing previous research to gather information. Researchers searched various databases and examined studies published up to 2012. They selected randomized and quasi-randomized studies that compared different approaches to managing hyperextension injuries without surgery. 

Results: 
The study identified three trials involving 366 participants. However, these trials were quite old and had some methodological flaws. None of the studies reported on patients' own assessment of their function. The trials compared different types of immobilization and mobility over various durations. However, none of the interventions showed significant differences in outcomes such as pain and range of motion at the six-month and three-year follow-up periods. 

The investigator's conclusion is that there is not enough evidence from these trials to determine the best approach for treating hyperextension injuries of the finger joints. Further research is needed to inform decisions about immobilization and other conservative management options.
