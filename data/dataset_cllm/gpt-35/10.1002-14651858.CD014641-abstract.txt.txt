Plain Title: Impact of LF-LAM on Mortality and Treatment of Tuberculosis in Adults Living with HIV

Rationale: Tuberculosis is a common and serious problem for people living with HIV. Many of these individuals die while in the hospital. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a test that can quickly diagnose tuberculosis in people with HIV. This test has been recommended by the World Health Organization. This review study looked at how using the LF-LAM test affects the mortality rates and other important outcomes in adults living with HIV.

Trial Design: The study included adults (15 years and older) living with HIV who were in either inpatient or outpatient settings. Three trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The LF-LAM test was compared to other tests used for diagnosing tuberculosis such as microscopy, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests. The study assessed the impact of LF-LAM on mortality and the time it took to diagnose and start tuberculosis treatment.

Results: In inpatient settings, using LF-LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy can reduce the risk of death for people with HIV. The test also increases the likelihood of starting tuberculosis treatment. In outpatient settings, using LF-LAM may reduce the risk of death and significantly increase the number of people starting tuberculosis treatment. Overall, using LF-LAM along with other recommended tests can help diagnose tuberculosis in people with HIV more quickly.

In conclusion, the use of LF-LAM can reduce mortality and improve tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV, especially in inpatient settings. This is because the test allows for earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment. Outpatient settings can also benefit from LF-LAM, as it may reduce mortality and increase treatment initiation. These results support the use of LF-LAM alongside other tuberculosis diagnostic tests recommended by the World Health Organization to rapidly diagnose tuberculosis in people with HIV.
