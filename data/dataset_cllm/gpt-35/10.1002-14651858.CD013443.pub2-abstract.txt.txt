Plain Title: Medications for Preventing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Review

Rationale: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe condition that can greatly affect a person's well-being. Many medications have been suggested as potential ways to prevent or reduce the symptoms of PTSD. However, it is important to find medications that are effective and well-tolerated, as not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will develop PTSD. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of different medications for preventing PTSD in adults who have been exposed to a traumatic event.

Trial Design: This study looked at randomized clinical trials involving adults who had experienced any type of traumatic event. The trials compared different medications either with a placebo or with other medications. The study excluded trials that looked at medications combined with therapy. Participants were followed for a certain period of time to assess the effects of the medications.

Results: The study included 13 different studies with a total of 2023 participants. The medications that were evaluated included hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega-3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula, and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Most of the participants were recruited from emergency departments or trauma centers. Some participants had experienced intentional traumatic events, while others had experienced unintentional traumatic events. In some cases, participants had severe physical illnesses.

The study found that there is currently uncertain evidence regarding the effectiveness of these medications for preventing PTSD. The evidence for propranolol was inconclusive due to bias, inconsistency among study results, and imprecision of the effect estimate. The same was true for gabapentin. Other comparisons and outcomes also had insufficient or inconclusive evidence. It is important for future research to include larger sample sizes, better reporting of side effects, and measures of quality of life and functioning.

In conclusion, this study provides uncertain evidence regarding the use of various medications as strategies for preventing PTSD. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medications and their impact on patients' quality of life.
