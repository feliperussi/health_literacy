Plain Title: Benefits and Harms of Preventing Blood Clots in Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Rationale: Adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who receive asparaginase-based chemotherapy are at increased risk of developing dangerous blood clots. These blood clots can lead to treatment delays and the need to stop crucial leukemia medications, which can affect survival. However, it is uncertain whether preventing blood clots in these patients is beneficial. This study aimed to assess the benefits and potential harms of using medications to prevent blood clots in adults with ALL who are receiving asparaginase-based therapy.

Trial Design: The study involved searching medical databases and other sources for relevant research conducted up to June 2020. The search included both published studies and ongoing studies. The researchers included randomized controlled trials that compared different types of preventive medications or mechanical interventions to placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 years and older with ALL undergoing asparaginase-based chemotherapy. They also included observational studies to assess potential harms. The researchers collected and analyzed data according to established guidelines.

Results: The researchers identified 23 non-randomized studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. However, no randomized controlled trials were found to assess the benefits of preventive medications. The available evidence showed that the use of antithrombin concentrates or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent blood clots in adults with ALL is uncertain. The studies included in the analysis had limitations and biases, which made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the benefits and harms of these preventive measures. More research is needed to better understand the effects of thromboprophylaxis in this patient population.

Conclusion: Based on the current evidence, it is unclear whether preventing blood clots in adults with ALL who are undergoing asparaginase-based chemotherapy provides significant benefits or acceptable risks. The existing research is limited and of low quality, making it difficult to make firm conclusions. Future research may provide more reliable information on this topic.
