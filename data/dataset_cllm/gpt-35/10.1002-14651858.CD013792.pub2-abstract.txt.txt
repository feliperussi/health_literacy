Plain Title: Progestogen Treatments for Miscarriage: Effectiveness and Safety

Rationale: Miscarriage, the loss of pregnancy before 24 weeks, affects a significant number of women. Progesterone is important for maintaining a pregnancy, and different progestogen treatments have been tried to rescue pregnancies in women with early pregnancy bleeding and to prevent miscarriages in women with a history of multiple miscarriages. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of various progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

Trial Design: This study reviewed randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness and safety of progestogen treatments for preventing miscarriage. The trials included women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. The study lasted for a specific period, but the exact duration was not mentioned.

Results: The meta-analysis included seven trials involving 5,682 women. Different progestogen treatments were used, including vaginal micronized progesterone, dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone, and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone. Placebo was also used in some trials.

For women with threatened miscarriage, vaginal micronized progesterone and dydrogesterone showed no significant difference in the live birth rate compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate.

For women with recurrent miscarriage, vaginal micronized progesterone showed little to no difference in the live birth rate compared to placebo. The effects of dydrogesterone on recurrent miscarriage remain unclear.

Additional outcomes such as miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy also varied with progestogen treatments. Vaginal micronized progesterone did not significantly affect congenital abnormalities or adverse drug events compared to placebo.

Based on the available evidence, progestogens may not significantly impact the live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone might increase the live birth rate for women with a history of previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with no increase in adverse events. The effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for miscarriage are still uncertain.

In conclusion, this study provides insight into the effectiveness and safety of progestogen treatments for miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may be beneficial for women with a history of previous miscarriages, but more research is needed to determine the best treatment option for miscarriage.
