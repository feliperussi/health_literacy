Plain Title: Partnerships between Patients and Healthcare Providers: Uncertain Effects on Person-Centered Health Services

Rationale: Many healthcare services are focused on specific diseases or medical specialties, which may not fully meet the needs of individual patients. Involving patients as partners in healthcare decision-making could lead to more person-centered services. However, the effects of this approach are unclear. This study aims to assess the effects of partnerships between patients and healthcare providers on person-centered health services. The study is needed to understand if this approach can improve patient care and meet their needs.

Trial Design: This study reviewed previous research on the effects of partnerships between patients and healthcare providers. The researchers searched various databases and included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental trials, and cluster trials that met specific criteria. These trials involved both patients and healthcare providers meeting regularly in formal group formats to make decisions related to person-centered health services. The study analyzed the data from these trials to determine the effects of these partnerships.

Results: The study included five trials with a total of 16,257 patients and over 469 healthcare providers. The partnerships had different aims, including improving the person-centeredness of health services and training medical doctors on patient safety. However, the results were uncertain. The data available was limited, and there were very low-certainty evidence for some outcomes. The study did not find enough evidence to determine the effects of partnerships compared to usual practice without partnerships. Additionally, the effects of partnerships as part of multi-component interventions were also unclear. Overall, the confidence in the findings was very low due to various biases and limitations in the included studies.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, the effects of partnerships between patients and healthcare providers on person-centered health services are uncertain. More high-quality research is needed to understand the outcomes directly related to these partnerships. Well-designed trials focusing on patient-centered outcomes and mixed-methods research could help build a stronger evidence base in this area. Further research is necessary to determine if partnerships can truly improve patient care and meet their needs.
