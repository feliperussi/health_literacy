Plain Title: Comparison of Cuffed and Uncuffed Tubes for Breathing Support in Newborns

Rationale: 
Newborn babies sometimes need help with their breathing, and a procedure called endotracheal intubation is commonly used. This involves inserting a tube into the airway to assist with breathing. Some tubes have an inflatable cuff that can be used to prevent air leakage or other complications. In older children and adults, these cuffed tubes have been shown to be beneficial. However, it is still unclear whether cuffed tubes are also beneficial for newborns. This study aims to determine the benefits and risks of using cuffed tubes compared to uncuffed tubes for newborns who require respiratory support.

Trial Design: 
This study involved a thorough search of different medical databases to find relevant studies. The search included databases like CENTRAL, PubMed, and CINAHL. The researchers also checked trial registers and reference lists for additional studies. The study only included randomized controlled trials and similar types of studies. The participants were newborns who required breathing support. The use of cuffed tubes was compared to the use of uncuffed tubes, both in their inflated and non-inflated states. The researchers followed established guidelines for data collection and analysis, and they assessed the quality of the evidence using a standardized approach.

Results: 
The study identified one relevant trial that compared the use of cuffed tubes to uncuffed tubes. The trial included 69 newborns who met the criteria for this study. The results showed that using cuffed tubes may decrease the need for reintubation in newborns. This means that babies who received cuffed tubes were less likely to require the tube to be reinserted. However, the certainty of this evidence is very low, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. The study did not find any cases of certain complications like postextubation stridor or subglottic stenosis, but the evidence for these outcomes was also very uncertain. No babies in the study required surgical interventions related to the use of the tubes. Overall, the evidence from this study is limited due to its small size and potential biases.

In conclusion, further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using cuffed tubes for breathing support in newborns. The current evidence is based on a single study with a small number of participants, which means that there is still a lot we don't know about this topic. More studies are necessary, including ones that focus on both short-term use (such as during surgery) and long-term use (such as in cases of chronic lung disease). These studies should involve newborns and provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness and safety of cuffed tubes in the neonatal population.
