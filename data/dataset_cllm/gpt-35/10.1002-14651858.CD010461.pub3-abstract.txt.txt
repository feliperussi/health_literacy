Plain Title: Effectiveness of Advanced Sperm Selection Techniques on Assisted Reproductive Technology Outcomes

Rationale:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of advanced sperm selection techniques used in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These techniques are used to improve the chances of successful fertilization and pregnancy. The main hypothesis is that these advanced selection techniques can increase the likelihood of selecting structurally intact and mature sperm with high DNA integrity for fertilization. This study is needed to determine if these techniques can enhance ART outcomes and understand their potential to treat infertility.

Trial Design:
This study was designed as a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The researchers searched various databases and other sources to find relevant trials. The study participants included women undergoing ART procedures such as IVF or ICSI. The duration of participation in the study varied depending on each individual trial.

Results:
The main results of the study showed that the use of hyaluronic acid selected sperm in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (HA-ICSI) may not have a significant impact on live birth rates or clinical pregnancy rates compared to traditional ICSI. However, HA-ICSI may reduce the risk of miscarriage. The evidence for other advanced sperm selection techniques, such as Zeta sperm selection and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), was of very low quality, and therefore, the effects on live birth, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage remain uncertain. More high-quality studies are needed to determine if any of these advanced techniques can be recommended for routine use in fertility treatments.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that HA-ICSI may not greatly improve the chances of live birth or clinical pregnancy compared to traditional ICSI. However, it may lower the risk of miscarriage. The effects of other advanced sperm selection techniques are still unclear due to the limited quality of the available evidence. Further research, including ongoing studies, is necessary to determine the effectiveness and safety of these techniques in routine ART practice.
