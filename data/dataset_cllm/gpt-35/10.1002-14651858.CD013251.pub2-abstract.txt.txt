Plain Title: Convective Radiofrequency Water Vapour Therapy for Urinary Problems in Men with Enlarged Prostate

Rationale: 
Men with an enlarged prostate often experience urinary problems that can significantly affect their quality of life. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a common surgical option, but new minimally invasive surgeries are being explored. Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted steam to treat the prostate. The purpose of this study was to see if this therapy could effectively improve urinary symptoms in men with an enlarged prostate.

Trial Design:
This study included men with an enlarged prostate who underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy or a sham procedure. The study design involved a randomized controlled trial, meaning that participants were randomly assigned to receive either the therapy or the sham procedure. The study lasted for a short period of three months.

Results:
The study found that convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy showed promise in improving urinary symptoms in men with an enlarged prostate. Compared to the sham procedure, the therapy led to significant improvements in urologic symptom scores and quality of life. However, there is uncertainty about the occurrence of major adverse events, such as complications. It was also found to have little to no effect on erectile and ejaculatory function. The therapy did increase the occurrence of minor adverse events, but the significance of these events is uncertain. It also increased the need for indwelling urinary catheters.

In conclusion, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy has shown potential in improving urinary symptoms and quality of life in men with an enlarged prostate. However, more research is needed to fully understand the therapy's effectiveness and safety compared to other treatment options.
