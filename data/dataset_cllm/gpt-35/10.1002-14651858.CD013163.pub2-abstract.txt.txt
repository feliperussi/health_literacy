Plain Title: Comparison of Different Lipid Emulsions for Preterm Infants: A Review

Rationale: Preterm infants often require parenteral nutrition, but the conventional soybean oil-based lipid emulsions (S-LE) used can have negative effects due to their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are available and may be safer and more effective for preterm infants. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of different LE in preterm infants, including those with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis.

Trial Design: This study reviewed 29 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2037 preterm infants. The infants were grouped based on the type of lipid emulsion used: 1. fish oil-containing LE, 2. conventional S-LE, and 3. alternative LE. The study analyzed the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis and other outcomes among these groups. Most infants received parenteral nutrition for four weeks or less, though some with cholestasis or surgical conditions received it for a longer duration.

Results: The analysis found no significant difference in the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis between fish oil-containing LE and non-fish oil LE in preterm infants. Similarly, there was no significant difference when considering different definitions of PNALD/cholestasis. However, in preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis, fish oil-containing LE showed a lower incidence of cholestasis compared to conventional S-LE. There were no notable differences in other outcomes such as growth, retinopathy of prematurity, or neonatal mortality between the different types of LE.

Conclusion: Based on this review, no specific lipid emulsion was found to be superior to others in preventing PNALD/cholestasis, promoting growth, or improving other clinical outcomes in preterm infants. The evidence is insufficient to determine the advantages of fish oil-containing LE in infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis. Further research with larger trials is needed to better understand the ideal composition of lipid emulsions and the role of fish oil and alternative LEs in improving outcomes for preterm infants.
