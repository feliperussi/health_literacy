Plain Title: Treatment Options for Respiratory Morbidity in Children with Severe Global Developmental Delay

Rationale: Children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD) have intellectual disabilities and motor impairments that limit their functional movement. This can lead to respiratory problems and impact their quality of life. Although various treatments are available, there is no comprehensive review of the best practices. This study aims to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical treatment options for managing respiratory morbidity in children with SGDD.

Trial Design: The study conducted comprehensive searches of various databases to gather information on non-pharmaceutical treatment options for respiratory morbidity in children with SGDD. Randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and cohort studies involving children up to 18 years old with severe neurological impairments and respiratory morbidity were included. The study used standard methodological procedures and presented the results using a narrative approach due to heterogeneity.

Results: The review included fifteen studies that assessed different treatment modalities in various settings. The studies had small sample sizes and varied in quality. Some potential benefits were seen with the use of non-invasive ventilation, mechanically assisted coughing, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), positive expiratory pressure, and supportive seating. No serious adverse effects were reported for ventilatory support or airway clearance interventions, except for one incident. However, these findings are tentative and need to be tested in future randomized trials. Overall, there is no high-quality evidence for any single intervention for managing respiratory morbidity in children with SGDD.

Conclusion: This review highlights the lack of high-quality evidence for treating respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. Further research is needed to gather more reliable evidence and guide treatment for this vulnerable patient group.
