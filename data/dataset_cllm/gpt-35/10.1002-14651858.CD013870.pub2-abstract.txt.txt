Rationale: Atopic eczema is a chronic skin condition that causes a lot of problems for patients. Sometimes, when other treatments don't work well, doctors use a special treatment called phototherapy. This study was done to see if phototherapy can help people with atopic eczema and if it is safe to use. 

Trial Design: This study looked at different types of phototherapy and how they affect people with atopic eczema. They included people of different ages, both adults, and children, who were diagnosed with atopic eczema. The study lasted for an average of 13 weeks, and participants were mainly from dermatology clinics. 

Results: The study included 32 trials with a total of 1219 participants. The participants ranged in age from 5 to 83 years, and there were an equal number of males and females. Different types of phototherapy were used in the trials, such as ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A. The results showed that phototherapy may help reduce the signs of atopic eczema and improve symptoms like itching. It may also lead to better overall improvement in the condition. The study found no major safety concerns with phototherapy. However, more research is needed to fully understand the safety and effectiveness of phototherapy for atopic eczema. 

In conclusion, phototherapy has the potential to be a beneficial treatment option for atopic eczema. It can help reduce signs, improve symptoms, and overall improve the condition. However, more research is needed to fully understand its safety and effectiveness.
