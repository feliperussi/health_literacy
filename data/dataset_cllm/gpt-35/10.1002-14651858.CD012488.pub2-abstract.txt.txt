Plain Title: Psychological Therapies for Anxiety and Depression in Children with Long-Term Physical Conditions

Rationale: Long-term physical conditions affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide, and they are at a higher risk of developing psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison to other treatments for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.

Trial Design: The study involved a review of randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, and cross-over trials. These trials investigated the use of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in children with long-term physical conditions. The study included a total of 28 RCTs and one cross-over trial, with 1349 participants. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high-income countries. The study duration varied across trials.

Results: The study found that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies in reducing short-term depression in children with long-term physical conditions. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing short-term anxiety was inconclusive. Sensitivity analyses suggested that interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than therapies targeting other symptoms or general coping. The type of intervention, severity of depression, and type of long-term physical condition may also impact the overall treatment effect. The study also found that psychological therapies improved quality of life and symptoms of long-term physical conditions in the short term but did not show a clear impact on functioning. Importantly, no adverse effects related to psychological therapies were identified.

Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, psychological therapies, especially those based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), may be more likely to work in children and adolescents with mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression in the short term. However, there is a lack of therapies specifically designed to treat health-related anxiety in this age group. It is important to note that the evidence quality varied from low to moderate, and only one trial had an available protocol. Further research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of psychological therapies for children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.
