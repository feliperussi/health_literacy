Plain Language Summary:

1. Plain Title: Treatments for Loss of Smell After COVID-19

2. Rationale: Many people who have had COVID-19 experience problems with their sense of smell. This can have a big impact on their quality of life, but we don't know the best way to treat it yet. There have been some suggestions for treatments, like medication and olfactory training, but we don't know if they actually work. This study aims to find out if any treatment is helpful.

3. Trial Design: The study included people who had lost their sense of smell for at least four weeks after having COVID-19. They divided the participants into two groups. One group received corticosteroid medication plus nasal treatment, and the other group received a different medication called palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin. The participants were tested to see if their sense of smell improved after the treatments. It was a small study with only 30 participants.

4. Results: The study found that there is very little evidence to support the use of these treatments for loss of smell after COVID-19. The results were based on a small number of participants, so we can't draw strong conclusions. However, there are more studies being conducted in this area, so we may learn more in the future.
