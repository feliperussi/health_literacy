Plain Title: The Benefits and Harms of Statins as a Treatment for Asthma

Rationale: Asthma is a common respiratory disease that causes breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. Statins, which are commonly used to lower lipid levels in the blood, have shown potential as an additional treatment for asthma. However, more evidence is needed to determine the benefits and risks of using statins for asthma treatment.

Trial Design: This study aimed to assess the benefits and harms of using statins as a complement to standard therapy for both adults and children with asthma. The researchers searched various databases for relevant studies and included randomized controlled trials that lasted at least 12 weeks. All participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma were considered eligible, regardless of age, sex, severity of the disease, or previous treatment. The researchers analyzed the selected studies and evaluated the risk of bias using established methods.

Results: The study found only one trial, which involved 60 individuals with chronic asthma. This trial compared the effects of atorvastatin (a type of statin) with a placebo (a dummy treatment) in treating asthma symptoms. Unfortunately, the trial did not provide data on the main outcomes or adverse events. Therefore, it remains uncertain how atorvastatin affects lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second - FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) compared to the placebo. The trial did not report any serious side effects from the treatments. However, the study did have inconsistencies in its reported data, which adds further uncertainty to the findings.

Conclusions: Due to the very low-quality evidence available, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of using statins to treat asthma. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the impact of statins on individuals with asthma. These future trials should have larger sample sizes, longer treatment durations, and assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilization, and costs. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include subgroups of obese individuals with asthma in future studies to better understand the potential benefits of statins in this population.
