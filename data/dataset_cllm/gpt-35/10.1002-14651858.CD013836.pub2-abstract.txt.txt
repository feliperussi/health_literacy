Plain Title: Different Antibiotic Regimens for Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis

Rationale: Neonatal sepsis is a serious condition and a leading cause of death in newborns. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on how to diagnose and treat it. Due to the challenges in diagnosing sepsis and the weakened immune system of newborns, many babies are given antibiotics even if they may not have sepsis. Antibiotics are commonly used in neonatal intensive care units. However, previous studies have shown that most babies treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis actually have negative blood cultures. This study aims to update the evidence on different antibiotic regimens for late-onset neonatal sepsis.

Trial Design: The study design involves a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare different antibiotic regimens for late-onset neonatal sepsis. The participants in the trials are babies older than 72 hours of life who are suspected or diagnosed with sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Trials that focus on fungal infections are not included. The researchers searched various electronic databases and clinical trials databases to identify relevant studies. Three review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included serious adverse events and various complications related to sepsis.

Results: The study included five RCTs involving a total of 580 participants. However, all of the trials had a high risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was very low. The five trials compared different combinations of antibiotics. Unfortunately, a meta-analysis could not be conducted due to a lack of relevant data. None of the comparisons showed any evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, complications, or other outcomes. However, the trials were not large enough to provide conclusive evidence on the benefits and risks of specific antibiotic regimens. The uncertainties in the results are mainly due to the small size of the trials and the potential for systematic errors.

Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, there is insufficient support for any antibiotic regimen being superior to another in the treatment of late-onset neonatal sepsis. More RCTs with low risks of bias are needed to assess the different antibiotic regimens and provide more reliable evidence.
