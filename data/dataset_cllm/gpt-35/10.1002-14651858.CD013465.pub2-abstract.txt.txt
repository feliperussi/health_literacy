Plain Title: Personalized Fortification of Breast Milk for Preterm Infants: Improving Growth and Development

Rationale: Preterm infants have unique nutritional needs that are not fully met by regular breast milk. Standard fortification methods do not consider individual differences in infants and assume that all breast milk has the same nutritional content. This study aimed to determine if individualized fortification, based on the infant's blood urea nitrogen levels or the macronutrient content of breast milk, can reduce mortality and morbidity and promote growth and development in preterm infants.

Trial Design: This study included preterm infants born before 37 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight below 2500 grams. The study design involved comparing three different fortification strategies: standard non-individualized fortification, adjustable fortification based on blood urea nitrogen levels, and targeted fortification based on milk analyzer measurements. The duration of the study ranged from two to seven weeks.

Results: The findings showed that individualized fortification, whether targeted or adjustable, improved weight gain, length gain, and head circumference gain during the intervention period compared to standard fortification. Targeted fortification also resulted in increased weight gain and length gain. Adjustable fortification led to increased weight gain, length gain, and head circumference gain. However, there was not enough evidence to determine if individualized fortification had an impact on in-hospital mortality, lung and intestinal complications, bacterial infections, eye conditions, bone health, length of hospital stay, or growth after hospital discharge. Severe neurodevelopmental disability was not reported as an outcome in any study.

Conclusions: Based on moderate- to low-certainty evidence, this study suggests that individualized fortification of breast milk can improve the growth velocity of weight, length, and head circumference in very low birth weight infants. However, the evidence regarding long-term safety and clinical benefits beyond short-term growth is limited. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of personalized fortification for preterm infants receiving breast milk.
