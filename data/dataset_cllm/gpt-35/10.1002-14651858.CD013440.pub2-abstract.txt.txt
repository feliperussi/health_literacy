Plain Title: Early Palliative Care Interventions for People with Brain Tumors: A Review

Rationale: Brain tumors can have a severe impact on patients' physical, cognitive, and social functioning, leading to a decline in their quality of life. The provision of early palliative and supportive care services has the potential to improve outcomes for patients and their caregivers. However, the role and effectiveness of these interventions have not been well-studied. This study aims to assess the evidence for early palliative care interventions for adults with brain tumors and their carers, in order to guide improvements in service provision.

Trial Design: The study conducted searches in various databases and registries to identify relevant studies that evaluated early palliative care interventions. Both qualitative and quantitative research studies were included. The participants in the studies were adults with a confirmed diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumor, and their informal caregivers. The data extraction and analysis followed established Cochrane methodological procedures.

Results: After a thorough search and review process, only one trial was included in the analysis. This trial focused on early cognitive rehabilitation for individuals with brain tumors, particularly high-grade gliomas. The intervention consisted of therapist-led computerized exercises addressing various cognitive domains over a four-week period. The results showed no significant differences in tests of logical-executive function, but improvements were observed in visual attention and verbal memory. However, the certainty of the evidence was considered to be very low.

Conclusions: Currently, there is a lack of research specifically focused on early palliative interventions for people with brain tumors. Future studies should address methodological shortcomings and clearly describe the population under investigation, timing and setting of the intervention, and the specific components of the palliative care intervention. This will help improve the understanding and implementation of early palliative care for individuals with brain tumors, ultimately enhancing their quality of life and well-being.
