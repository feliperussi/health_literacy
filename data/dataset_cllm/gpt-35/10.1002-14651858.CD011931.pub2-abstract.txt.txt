Plain Title: Pharmacological Interventions for Pain After Brain Surgery

Rationale: Pain after brain surgery can impact recovery. The effectiveness of different medications for preventing postoperative pain in adults undergoing brain surgery is not well understood. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of these medications in terms of pain relief, use of additional pain medication, incidence of chronic headache, sedative effects, length of hospital stay, and adverse events. Understanding which medications work best is important for improving patient outcomes.

Trial Design: This study included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of medications to prevent acute postoperative pain in adults undergoing brain surgery. The study collected data from different sources including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and trial registries. The participants in the study were both blinded and non-blinded. The study analyzed validated pain score outcomes and used standardized procedures.

Results: The study included 42 completed studies with 3548 participants and identified one ongoing study. 

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) were found to reduce pain up to 24 hours after surgery. There is high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of NSAIDs in pain relief.
- Dexmedetomidine was found to reduce pain up to 12 hours after surgery. There is moderate-quality evidence supporting its effectiveness.
- Scalp blocks and scalp infiltration were found to reduce pain for up to 48 hours after surgery. However, the evidence for their effectiveness is of low to very low quality.
- Pregabalin or gabapentin may reduce pain up to 6 hours after surgery, but there is not enough evidence to support their effectiveness in later time frames.
- Acetaminophen did not show significant analgesic benefits.

The study also found that scalp blocks and dexmedetomidine may reduce the need for additional pain medication. Pregabalin or gabapentin may decrease the risk of nausea and vomiting, but more research is needed. It is important to note that the quality of the evidence for these findings is low. Further research is necessary to gather more conclusive evidence.

In conclusion, NSAIDs have been shown to be effective in reducing pain after brain surgery. Other medications such as dexmedetomidine, scalp blocks, scalp infiltration, pregabalin, and gabapentin may also provide pain relief, but the evidence is less certain. Future studies should focus on improving the quality of evidence and understanding the potential benefits and risks of these medications for patients undergoing brain surgery.
