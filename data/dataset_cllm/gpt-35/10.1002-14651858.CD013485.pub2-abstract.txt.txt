Plain Title: Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Asthma: Improving Exercise Performance and Quality of Life

Rationale: Asthma is a respiratory disease that causes breathing difficulties and other symptoms. While exercise is beneficial for asthma patients, the effectiveness of traditional rehabilitation methods is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether pulmonary rehabilitation can improve exercise performance, asthma control, and quality of life in adults with asthma.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. The rehabilitation program consisted of at least four weeks of aerobic training and education or self-management. Co-interventions were allowed, but exercise training alone was not permitted. The study lasted for three to four weeks for inpatient programs and eight to twelve weeks for outpatient programs.

Results: The study included 10 trials involving 894 participants with asthma, aged 27 to 54 years. Pulmonary rehabilitation was found to increase maximal oxygen uptake after completing the program, indicating improved exercise performance. However, the certainty of this evidence was low. Pulmonary rehabilitation also likely improved functional exercise capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk distance. This improvement exceeded the clinically important difference threshold for people with respiratory diseases. The evidence regarding the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on asthma control was low, but it may lead to a small improvement in asthma control. However, the evidence for this was uncertain. Pulmonary rehabilitation also showed promise in improving overall quality of life, although the evidence for this was uncertain. The study reported minimal adverse events associated with the intervention.

In conclusion, moderate certainty evidence suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation can lead to meaningful improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life for adults with asthma. However, the evidence regarding maximal exercise capacity and asthma control is limited. The study also highlighted the need for future research with better study designs and larger sample sizes to further explore the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on asthma management.
