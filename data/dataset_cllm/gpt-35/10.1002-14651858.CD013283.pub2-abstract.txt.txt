Plain Title: First Aid Glucose Administration for Hypoglycemia: Which Route is Best?

Rationale: Hypoglycemia, low blood sugar, is common in people with diabetes and can also occur in individuals without diabetes. It is important to know the best way to administer glucose in a first aid situation for suspected hypoglycemia. This study aimed to assess the effects of different routes of glucose administration for symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Trial Design: This study involved searching various databases for studies that evaluated the effects of glucose administration in individuals with hypoglycemia. The studies included both adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycemia, as well as healthy volunteers. Glucose was administered by different routes such as buccal (inside the cheek), sublingual (under the tongue), oral (by mouth), and rectal. The study analyzed the data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.

Results: The study included four studies that evaluated a total of 77 participants. The studies had different routes of glucose administration and included individuals with hypoglycemia and healthy volunteers. The results showed that sublingual glucose administration (using table sugar under the tongue) resulted in higher blood glucose levels after 20 minutes compared to oral administration in children with hypoglycemia and symptoms of malaria or respiratory tract infection. However, there was no substantial difference in blood glucose levels at 20 minutes. Sublingual administration also decreased the time to resolution of hypoglycemia. Buccal glucose administration resulted in lower blood glucose levels after 20 minutes compared to oral administration. However, there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose levels at 20 minutes favoring oral administration. The study also analyzed the combined oral and buccal mucosal route using a dextrose gel, but no significant improvements were identified. 

In conclusion, when providing first aid for hypoglycemia, oral glucose administration results in higher blood glucose levels after 20 minutes compared to buccal administration. Administering a dextrose gel using a combined oral and buccal mucosal route did not show significant differences compared to oral administration. In children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar resulted in higher blood glucose levels after 20 minutes compared to oral administration. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the low number of participants and studies, as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies.
