Plain Title: Monoclonal Antibodies for Treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leads to frequent hospitalizations and poses a significant burden on patients. Some patients with COPD have high levels of eosinophils, which can worsen their condition. Monoclonal antibodies that target interleukin 5 (IL‐5) or its receptor (IL‐5R) are used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma and may also benefit patients with COPD and eosinophilic phenotype.

Trial Design: This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of monoclonal antibodies that target IL‐5 signaling (anti‐IL‐5 or anti‐IL‐5Rα) compared to a placebo in adults with COPD. The study design involved randomized controlled trials, where participants were assigned to receive either the monoclonal antibody therapy or the placebo. The study included adults with COPD and analyzed outcomes such as exacerbations, hospitalizations, serious adverse events, and quality of life. The study was conducted over a period of time to observe the effects of the treatment.

Results: The study included six trials with a total of 5,542 participants. The monoclonal antibodies used were mepolizumab and benralizumab. Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 19% in patients with high eosinophil counts. Mepolizumab 300 mg reduced exacerbations by 14% in patients with elevated eosinophils. Benralizumab 100 mg and 10 mg also reduced the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization in patients with high eosinophil counts. The monoclonal antibodies did not show significant differences in quality of life measures compared to the placebo. The treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab was found to be safe, with no significant difference in adverse events compared to the placebo.

Conclusion: Monoclonal antibodies, such as mepolizumab and benralizumab, can likely decrease the rate of exacerbations in patients with COPD who have high levels of blood eosinophils. This emphasizes the importance of identifying different disease phenotypes in COPD and may guide personalized treatment strategies. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these drugs in clinical practice, including identifying the appropriate threshold for eosinophil levels. Cost effectiveness analysis should also be considered due to the high cost of these therapies.
