Plain Title: Immediate Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery (ISBCS) Versus Delayed Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery (DSBCS): A Comparison Study

Rationale: Cataracts, which affect both eyes in most cases, can cause vision problems for patients. Traditionally, cataract surgery is done on each eye separately on different days. However, there is a new procedure called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) where both eyes are operated on the same day but in separate procedures. ISBCS has potential advantages such as fewer hospital visits, faster recovery, and lower costs. However, concerns exist about potential adverse effects. This study aims to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of ISBCS compared to the traditional delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS).

Trial Design: This study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies to assess complications, visual outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. The search included various databases and there were no language restrictions. The study included a total of 14 studies conducted in different countries. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using standard methods.

Results: The study found that both ISBCS and DSBCS had a very low risk of endophthalmitis, a serious postoperative complication. The study also found no difference in refractive outcomes and postoperative complications between ISBCS and DSBCS. The cost per participant was found to be lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. However, the evidence for these findings was limited and of varying certainty. Quality of life outcomes did not differ between the two procedures.

Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, there are likely no significant differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS for patients with cataracts. ISBCS may have lower costs compared to DSBCS. However, more well-designed cost-effectiveness studies are needed to confirm these findings and provide more accurate measurements of quality-adjusted life years.
