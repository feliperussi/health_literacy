Plain Title: Screening for Lung Cancer using Low-Dose Computed Tomography

Rationale: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although lung cancer screening has not been widely implemented, there is growing evidence supporting the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening. LDCT has the potential to reduce lung cancer-related mortality. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of LDCT screening in reducing lung cancer-related deaths and to evaluate any potential harms associated with the screening.

Trial Design: This study used a randomized controlled trial design. The participants included individuals aged 40 years or older with a history of significant smoking (e.g., smoking for at least 20 pack-years). The study involved 11 trials conducted in Europe and the USA, with a total of 94,445 participants. The screening frequency varied from annual to biennial, and the duration of screening ranged from 1 to 10 years. The follow-up period for assessing mortality was between 5 and 12 years.

Results: The analysis of the trials showed that LDCT screening reduced lung cancer-related mortality by 21% compared to control groups that received no screening or chest radiography (X-ray) screening. It also resulted in a 5% reduction in all-cause mortality. Females appeared to benefit more in terms of lung cancer-related mortality compared to males. However, LDCT screening led to more frequent invasive tests. The analysis did not show a significant difference in 60-day postoperative mortality between the LDCT and control groups. LDCT screening had higher false-positive results and recall rates compared to chest radiography screening. There was evidence of potential overdiagnosis of lung cancer with LDCT screening, although more trials are needed to determine the exact extent. LDCT screening was associated with lower anxiety scores compared to the control group. Unfortunately, there was insufficient data to assess the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behavior.

Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that LDCT screening can reduce lung cancer-related mortality in high-risk populations, particularly individuals over the age of 40 with a significant smoking history. However, there is a need for further research to determine the selection criteria for participants, as well as the optimal frequency and duration of screening. It is also important to consider the potential for overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Ongoing trials are exploring the feasibility of lung cancer screening in non-smokers.
