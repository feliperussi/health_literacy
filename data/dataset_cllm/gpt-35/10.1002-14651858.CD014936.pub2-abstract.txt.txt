Plain Title: Quitting Smoking Reduces the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease

Rationale: Smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary heart disease. However, if you have already been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, quitting smoking can help prevent further cardiovascular events. This study aimed to examine the impact of smoking cessation on death from cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with newly diagnosed coronary heart disease.

Trial Design: The study included cohort studies and randomized controlled trials of at least six months' duration. Adults over 18 years old with diagnosed coronary heart disease who smoked at the time of diagnosis were recruited. The study assessed whether participants quit smoking or continued smoking during the study. The primary outcomes measured were death from cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, new-onset angina, and change in quality of life. The study followed standard methods for screening and data extraction.

Results: The study included 68 studies with a total of 80,702 participants. Quitting smoking was associated with a decreased risk of death from cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events compared to continued smoking. Specifically, smoking cessation was associated with a 39% reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 43% reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Additionally, quitting smoking was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. There was no evidence of quitting smoking worsening quality of life and some evidence suggesting an improvement in quality of life.

Conclusion: This study provides moderate-certainty evidence that quitting smoking is associated with a one-third reduction in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease in individuals who quit smoking after a diagnosis of coronary heart disease. This association may be causal due to the restoration of endothelial and platelet function after quitting smoking, which can decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular events. These results highlight the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events and potentially improve quality of life. Further research is needed to account for other factors that may influence the results.
