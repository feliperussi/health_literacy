Plain Title: Venom Immunotherapy for Preventing Allergic Reactions to Insect Stings

Rationale: 
Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is a treatment used to prevent allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have previously experienced a sting reaction. The effectiveness and safety of this treatment have not been thoroughly studied before. This study aims to assess the effects of immunotherapy using insect venom extract in preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in individuals who have had a previous allergic reaction.

Trial Design: 
This study used a systematic review approach to gather relevant data. The researchers searched various databases and sources to identify randomized controlled trials that examined the use of venom immunotherapy in insect sting allergy. A total of 7 trials involving 392 participants were included in the review. The trials included both children and adults with a history of systemic or large local reactions to a sting. The treatment involved either sublingual or subcutaneous administration of venom immunotherapy. The study's duration varied depending on the specific trial.

Results: 
The results of the study showed that venom immunotherapy effectively prevented systemic allergic reactions to insect stings. In the trials, only 2.7% of participants treated with venom immunotherapy experienced subsequent systemic allergic reactions, compared to 39.8% of untreated participants. The treatment was found to be effective regardless of whether the sting occurred accidentally or intentionally as part of a trial procedure. Venom immunotherapy also proved to be effective in preventing large local reactions to stings and improving the overall quality of life for participants.

It is important to note that while venom immunotherapy is effective, it carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reactions. This means that there is a chance of experiencing a negative reaction to the treatment. However, the benefits of venom immunotherapy in preventing allergic reactions to insect stings outweigh the risks.

In conclusion, venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom is an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings. It can significantly improve quality of life for individuals with insect sting allergies. However, it is important to be aware of the small but significant risk of systemic adverse reactions associated with this treatment. Overall, this study provides valuable evidence supporting the use of venom immunotherapy in managing insect sting allergies.
