Plain Title: Exercise as a Treatment for Respiratory Health in Cystic Fibrosis: A Review

Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a condition that affects the respiratory system. There are various techniques called airway clearance techniques (ACTs) used to manage the respiratory health of people with CF. However, none of these techniques have been proven to be superior. Exercise is an alternative ACT that is thought to improve the clearing of mucus from the lungs. Some individuals with CF have started using exercise as a replacement for traditional ACTs, but there is no agreed-upon recommendation for this. This study aims to review the evidence to determine if exercise is a safe and effective alternative ACT for people with CF.

Trial Design: This study compares the effects of exercise to other ACTs in improving respiratory function and clinical outcomes in people with CF. The study includes randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials. The participants in these trials range in age from 7 to 41 years old and have varying levels of disease severity. Some trials compare exercise alone to other ACTs, while others combine exercise with other techniques. The duration of the study varies depending on the specific trial.

Results: The review included four trials. The evidence from these trials was of very low certainty, which means that we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT for CF. One trial compared exercise to the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT). It found no significant change in lung function after exercise. Two trials compared exercise combined with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) to PD&P alone. The results were inconclusive, with some trials showing potential improvements with exercise and others showing no clear effect. One trial compared exercise to underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) and found no significant differences between the two. Adverse events were rare in all trials.

Conclusion: Based on the limited evidence available, we cannot determine whether exercise is a suitable alternative to traditional ACTs for people with CF. More studies are needed to provide a clearer understanding of the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. These studies should also consider outcomes that are important to individuals with CF.
