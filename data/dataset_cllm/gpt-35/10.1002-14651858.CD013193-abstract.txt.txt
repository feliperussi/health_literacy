Plain Title: Teledermatology for Detecting Skin Cancer

Rationale: Skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), can be serious and potentially fatal. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Teledermatology allows generalist clinicians to seek the opinion of a specialist dermatologist remotely, using either digital images or live video consultations. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of teledermatology in diagnosing skin cancer compared to in-person diagnosis.

Trial Design: The researchers conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology. They included studies that compared teledermatology to face-to-face diagnosis and used histological confirmation or clinical follow-up as reference standards. The researchers extracted data and assessed the quality of each study. They analyzed the data and estimated sensitivity and specificity. The study included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for over 4,000 lesions and referral accuracy data for over 1,400 lesions.

Results: Teledermatology showed a high sensitivity of 94.9% in correctly diagnosing malignant lesions using photographic images. The specificity was 84.3%, indicating the ability to accurately identify non-malignant lesions. Comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology and in-person diagnosis by a dermatologist, but more research is needed to draw firm conclusions. The detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants showed more variable sensitivities and specificities. For lesion referral, teledermatology demonstrated good agreement with face-to-face assessment for lesions requiring positive action. However, for less concerning lesions, teledermatology tended to recommend excision, referral, or follow-up more often than in-person assessments.

Conclusion: The evidence suggests that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant skin lesions. Using teledermatology to triage potentially malignant cases or lesions for further evaluation is likely to be effective. However, more research is needed to evaluate the accuracy of teledermatology in diagnosing and triaging skin lesions.
