Plain Title: Predicting Relapse and Recurrence in Depression: A Summary of Prognostic Models

Rationale: Relapse and recurrence, which are the re-emergence of depressive symptoms or the onset of a new depressive episode after recovery, are common in depression. They can have negative effects on patients' outcomes and quality of life, as well as impose a high economic burden. Predicting relapse or recurrence while patients are in remission can help identify high-risk individuals and improve treatment outcomes by allocating interventions more efficiently. Prognostic models, which use various predictors to estimate individualized risk, can play a crucial role in this process.

Trial Design: This study aimed to summarize the predictive performance of prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder who are in remission or have recovered. The researchers conducted a comprehensive search of various databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. They also searched for grey literature, screened reference lists, and performed a forward citation search. The search was not restricted by date, language, or publication status.

Results: The study included 11 eligible prognostic model studies, which presented 10 unique prognostic models. Most of the studies assessed were at high overall risk of bias. One study with a low risk of bias presented a prognostic model with poor predictive performance. However, none of the identified studies examined the clinical utility or net benefit of the developed model. The authors concluded that there is a need for improved prognostic research in this clinical area, with future studies adhering to best practice recommendations for model development, validation, and reporting.

In summary, this study aimed to summarize the performance of prognostic models in predicting the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder. The majority of the included studies were found to have a high risk of bias, and one study with low bias presented a model with poor predictive performance. More research is needed in this area to develop and validate better prognostic models. Future studies should adhere to best practice recommendations for model development, validation, and reporting.
