1. Plain Title: Organisational Interventions for Healthcare Services in Persons with Intellectual Disability
2. Rationale: People with intellectual disability face challenges in accessing healthcare, resulting in lower life expectancy, more health problems, and difficulties in receiving appropriate care. This study investigates organisational interventions to improve mental and physical health outcomes for individuals with intellectual disability.
3. Trial Design: The study reviewed randomized controlled trials that focused on organisational interventions for adult individuals with intellectual disability. The search included multiple databases and expert consultations. The selected trials assessed the effects of interventions such as increased service delivery, community-based therapy, and outreach treatment. 
4. Results: The study identified a limited number of trials that met the selection criteria. The interventions varied in their components, targeting mental health problems and behavioral issues. However, there were no studies specifically addressing physical health problems. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions was limited, with varying levels of certainty. It remains unclear whether interventions such as increased service delivery or outreach treatment decrease behavioral problems. Community-based specialist therapy showed some decrease in behavioral problems. There was inadequate evidence regarding the impact on caregiver burden and costs. Overall, the study highlights the urgent need for more high-quality research to identify optimal healthcare services for individuals with intellectual disability and concurrent physical problems.
