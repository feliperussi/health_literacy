Plain Title: Antibiotic Regimens for Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: What We Know So Far

Rationale: Neonatal sepsis is a serious condition that can lead to illness and death in babies. It is one of the main causes of neonatal mortality worldwide. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on how to diagnose and treat neonatal sepsis. This is because it can be difficult to diagnose, and the immune systems of newborns are not fully developed. As a result, many newborns receive antibiotics as a precaution. Antibiotics are the most commonly used treatment in neonatal intensive care units. The last review of the available evidence was done in 2004, so there is a need for an updated review to assess the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early-onset neonatal sepsis. 

Trial Design: This study aimed to assess the benefits and potential harms of different antibiotic regimens for early-onset neonatal sepsis. The researchers conducted a systematic review by searching various medical databases and clinical trials databases for relevant studies. They included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared different antibiotic regimens for newborns with early-onset neonatal sepsis. The participants in the studies were newborn babies aged between birth and 72 hours. The researchers assessed the studies for inclusion, collected and analyzed the data, and evaluated the risk of bias. They used a method called GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The main outcomes of interest were mortality and various adverse events related to sepsis and antibiotic treatment. The researchers focused on the maximum follow-up period for their analysis. 

Results: The researchers included five RCTs involving a total of 865 participants in their analysis. However, all of the trials had a high risk of bias, which means that the results may not be reliable. The evidence from these studies was of very low certainty according to the GRADE approach. The trials compared various combinations of antibiotics, but the analysis did not yield enough data to conduct a meta-analysis. None of the comparisons showed any evidence of a difference in terms of mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, kidney toxicity, developmental problems, or digestive system complications. However, the trials were not large enough to provide conclusive evidence about the benefits and risks of specific antibiotic regimens. Some outcomes, such as respiratory support and hearing problems, were not assessed in any of the trials. In conclusion, the current evidence is insufficient to determine if any particular antibiotic regimen is better than others for early-onset neonatal sepsis. More large-scale RCTs with low risk of bias are needed to provide clearer answers.
