Plain Title: The Effects of Psychosocial Interventions on Fatigue in Patients with Incurable Cancer

Rationale: Fatigue is a common and burdensome symptom for patients with incurable cancer who are undergoing palliative treatment. It can greatly impact their quality of life. Psychosocial interventions, which aim to address cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects, have shown promise in managing fatigue among cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the effects of these interventions on fatigue in adult patients with incurable cancer who are receiving palliative treatment.

Trial Design: This study is designed to understand how psychosocial interventions can help manage fatigue in patients with incurable cancer. We conducted a thorough search of various databases and clinical trial registries to gather relevant data. The study included randomized controlled trials that compared psychosocial interventions with usual care or other controls for adults aged 18 years or older undergoing palliative treatment for incurable cancer. The interventions involved at least two interactions between the patient and the care provider, where the care provider provided personal feedback to the patient. We collected data from 14 studies involving a total of 3077 participants. The trials investigated various types of psychosocial interventions with different aims and durations. The study also assessed the risk of bias and the quality of evidence using standard procedures.

Results: The main findings of this study do not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing fatigue immediately after the intervention. However, initial follow-up findings showed some benefits in fatigue reduction compared to the control group, but these benefits did not persist in the second follow-up. The study also found limited evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in improving physical functioning immediately after the intervention. However, these improvements were not sustained in the first follow-up. The findings did not support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving social functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, or cognitive functioning. Only a few studies evaluated adverse events, but they found no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of adverse events.

In conclusion, the overall quality of evidence for the effects of psychosocial interventions on fatigue in patients with incurable cancer is very low. Therefore, we have little confidence in the effectiveness of these interventions. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether psychosocial interventions can be beneficial in managing fatigue in patients with incurable cancer.
