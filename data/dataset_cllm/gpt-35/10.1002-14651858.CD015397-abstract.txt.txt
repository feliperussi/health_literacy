Plain Title: Unintended Consequences of COVID-19 Measures in Schools

Rationale: The study aims to examine the unintended health and societal consequences of measures implemented in schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures and understand their broader impacts in order to make informed decisions about their implementation, adaptation, or suspension. The study focuses on the range of unintended consequences, both beneficial and harmful, and the different study designs used to assess these outcomes.

Trial Design: The study included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies of any design that provided evidence on unintended consequences of COVID-19 measures in schools. This includes mathematical modeling, observational studies, and experimental/quasi-experimental designs. The study looked at effects in different population groups, primarily children and teachers. The search for evidence was conducted in various databases and reference collections, and the data were analyzed and summarized narratively and graphically.

Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies used quantitative methods, while some used qualitative methods or a combination of both. The identified interventions were categorized into four broad categories: measures to make contacts safer, measures to reduce contacts, surveillance and response measures, and multiple combined measures. The studies examined a wide range of unintended consequences, with most of them being considered harmful. These consequences included educational, psychosocial, physical health, health behavior, and environmental outcomes. However, there was a lack of research on psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes, as well as interventions aimed at reducing contact opportunities.

In conclusion, this study highlights the need for more focused research on specific measures and various unintended outcomes of COVID-19 measures in schools. There is a lack of evidence regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes, as well as interventions aimed at reducing contact opportunities. It is important for study investigators to provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics to aid in making informed decisions for specific circumstances. Further research is needed to fill these knowledge gaps and provide a broader understanding of the unintended consequences of school-based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis can be conducted.
