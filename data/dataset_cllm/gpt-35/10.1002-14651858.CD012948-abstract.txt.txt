Plain Title: Planned Birth for Pregnant Women with Pre-existing Diabetes

Rationale: Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) face higher risks of complications for both themselves and their babies. Current guidelines recommend elective birth towards the end of pregnancy to reduce the risk of perinatal mortality. This study aims to examine whether planned birth, either through induction of labor or caesarean birth, at or near term can improve health outcomes for these women and their infants.

Trial Design: This study will include pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) and will compare planned birth, at or near term gestation (37 to 40 weeks), with an expectant approach. We will search for both randomized and non-randomized trials that evaluate the effectiveness of planned birth. The study duration will depend on the specific trial, but participants will be involved until the birth of their baby.

Results: Unfortunately, we did not find any eligible published trials for inclusion in this review. However, we did find one randomized trial that investigated whether an expectant approach reduces the rate of caesarean birth in uncomplicated pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes and pre-existing diabetes. However, this trial did not distinguish between pre-existing and gestational diabetes, so it was not included in our analysis.

The lack of evidence prevents us from drawing firm conclusions on the health outcomes associated with planned birth for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. However, this review highlights the urgent need for high-quality trials to evaluate the effectiveness of planned birth at or near term gestation for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes compared to an expectant approach. These trials will provide crucial information to guide healthcare providers and pregnant women in making informed decisions about their care.
