Plain Title: Accuracy of Computer-Assisted Diagnosis for Detecting Skin Cancer

Rationale: It is important to detect all types of skin cancer early in order to improve patient outcomes. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are very serious forms of skin cancer that can spread and become life-threatening, while basal cell carcinoma (BCC) typically stays localized but can still damage surrounding tissue. There is a need for a reliable method to accurately diagnose and differentiate between these types of skin cancer to avoid unnecessary surgeries or missed cases. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems that use artificial intelligence have the potential to analyze skin lesion data and provide accurate diagnoses. These systems can be helpful for general practitioners to determine if a high-risk lesion needs further evaluation by a specialist. By combining CAD with clinical and dermoscopic evaluation, we can potentially reduce unnecessary surgeries without missing melanoma cases.

Trial Design: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of CAD systems in diagnosing invasive melanoma, atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC, and cSCC in adults. We compared the accuracy of CAD systems with that of dermoscopy, another common diagnostic tool. We searched multiple databases and included studies that evaluated CAD alone or in comparison with dermoscopy. The studies included adults with suspicious skin lesions and used histological confirmation or clinical follow-up as the reference standard. We collected data from these studies and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of CAD systems using a standardized model. We also assessed the impact of human decision-making on the accuracy of CAD diagnoses by excluding studies that involved clinicians in the decision-making process.

Results: We included a total of 42 studies in our analysis. The CAD systems evaluated varied in terms of hardware and software technologies, classification algorithms, training methods, and the features analyzed. Overall, CAD systems showed high sensitivity for identifying invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations. However, the specificity of CAD systems, especially for spectroscopy-based CAD (Spectro-CAD), was low and highly variable. When analyzing the pooled data from the studies, Derm-CAD had a sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity of 74.3% for detecting melanoma, while multispectral imaging CAD (MSI-CAD) had a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 43.6%. If applied to a population of 1000 lesions, Derm-CAD would miss 20 melanomas and result in 206 false-positive results, while MSI-CAD would miss 14 melanomas and result in 451 false diagnoses. Although CAD systems show promise for detecting melanoma, more research is needed to understand their impact on clinical decision-making and their effectiveness in different settings.

Conclusions: CAD systems have high sensitivity for detecting certain types of skin cancer, and they can be used as a helpful tool for specialists in minimizing the risk of missing melanomas. However, the current evidence base is limited, and more research is needed to assess the use of CAD in community settings and for detecting other types of skin cancer. It is also unclear which specific CAD system would be most suitable for clinical practice. Future studies should compare CAD systems to face-to-face dermoscopy in representative patient populations to evaluate their usefulness in real-world scenarios.
