Plain Title: Anticoagulation Therapy for Isolated Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism and Incidental SSPE: No Evidence for Effectiveness and Safety

Rationale: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and serious condition that can lead to death. It is the third most common cause of death among cardiovascular diseases. Multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has improved the diagnosis of PE and has led to the identification of more cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE. These conditions may not present with the typical symptoms of PE, but can still be found in some patients. Traditionally, all PEs are treated with anticoagulants regardless of location or size. However, there is a concern that some patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may not benefit from anticoagulation therapy and may experience unnecessary adverse events. It is important to study the clinical significance and prognosis of these conditions to determine if anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

Trial Design: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy compared to no treatment (control) in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. Randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Various databases were searched to gather relevant studies, and the methodological quality of the trials was assessed.

Results: No studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified. Therefore, there is currently no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy in patients with isolated subsegmental PE or incidental PE. Further research is needed before making informed decisions regarding treatment.

Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, it is unclear whether anticoagulation therapy is beneficial or safe for patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. More well-conducted research is necessary to provide guidance on appropriate treatment.
