Plain Title: Effects of Short-Acting Insulin Analogues in Treating Type 2 Diabetes

Rationale: Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that affects adults and can cause various health problems. There is controversy surrounding the use of short-acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin for treating type 2 diabetes. This study aims to determine whether short-acting insulin analogues are more effective in managing type 2 diabetes than regular human insulin. It is important to understand which medication is better for treating this condition and improving patients' health.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 24 weeks. The participants were adults with type 2 diabetes who were not pregnant. A total of 2,751 participants were enrolled in the study, with half receiving insulin analogues and the other half receiving regular human insulin. The study lasted an average of 41 weeks. Participants had varying durations of the disease, and specific criteria were used for selecting eligible participants. The trials were not blinded, which may have influenced the results for certain outcomes such as hypoglycemia. Various methods and results were reported across the trials.

Results: The study found no significant difference between short-acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin in terms of all-cause mortality, severe hypoglycemic events, or glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. The numbers of deaths and severe hypoglycemic episodes were similar between the two groups. The change in HbA1c was minimal and not statistically significant. The incidence of non-severe hypoglycemic episodes was slightly higher in the insulin analogue group, but the difference was not substantial. The study did not provide reliable results for health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Long-term effects and socioeconomic impacts were not investigated in the trials.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, there is no clear advantage in using short-acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin for treating type 2 diabetes. The certainty of the evidence is low, and more research is needed to determine the effects of short-acting insulin analogues on important outcomes such as mortality and complications of diabetes. Long-term data on efficacy and safety are necessary to make informed conclusions about the use of short-acting insulin analogues in managing type 2 diabetes.
