Plain Title: Exercise Training in Adults Undergoing Dialysis: Benefits and Safety 

Rationale: Dialysis treatments can have negative effects on the physical and psychosocial health of patients. This study aimed to investigate whether exercise training can improve outcomes for adults undergoing dialysis. The study assessed the potential benefits of exercise in terms of death, cardiovascular events, fatigue, functional capacity, pain, and depression. The goal was to determine the optimal exercise prescription for this population and address uncertainties regarding its relevance and sustainable benefits. 

Trial Design: The study design involved a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-RCTs. The researchers searched various databases and sources for relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were structured exercise programs lasting eight weeks or more for adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. The study compared exercise interventions to no exercise or sham exercise. Data collection and analysis involved assessing the search results for eligibility, extracting data, and evaluating the risk of bias. The primary outcomes of interest were death, cardiovascular events, and fatigue. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, depression, pain, functional capacity, blood pressure, adherence to the exercise program, and adverse events related to the intervention. 

Results: The study identified 89 relevant studies involving 4,291 participants. Out of these, 77 studies with 3,846 participants were included in the meta-analyses. The interventions lasted from eight weeks to two years and were typically done three times a week during dialysis treatments. The quality of the included studies was generally low, and blinding of participants was challenging due to the nature of the intervention. 

The results showed that exercise training had uncertain effects on death, cardiovascular events, and the mental component of quality of life. However, exercise training for two to 12 months may improve fatigue, physical component of quality of life, depressive symptoms, and pain. The magnitude of the improvement in depressive symptoms may be greater when maintaining the exercise beyond four months. Exercise training for three to 12 months was also found to improve functional capacity, as measured by increased distance walked and sit-to-stand cycles performed. 

The study did not find sufficient evidence to assess the safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis. The findings were consistent across different types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, and a combination of both). 

In conclusion, it remains uncertain whether exercise training improves death, cardiovascular events, or the mental component of quality of life in adults undergoing dialysis. However, exercise training is likely to improve depressive symptoms and functional capacity. There is low certainty evidence suggesting that exercise training may also improve fatigue, physical component of quality of life, and pain. The safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis is still uncertain.
