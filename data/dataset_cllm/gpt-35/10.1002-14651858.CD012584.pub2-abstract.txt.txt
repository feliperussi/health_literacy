Plain Title: Comparing the Effects of Continuing or Stopping Antiplatelet Therapy Before Surgery

Rationale: 
Antiplatelet therapy is commonly prescribed to patients with conditions like heart attack or stroke, or those who have undergone coronary stent placement. However, when these patients undergo non-cardiac surgery, they face increased risks due to the indications of the therapy. On one hand, continuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery may increase the chance of bleeding. On the other hand, discontinuing the therapy may increase the risk of thrombotic problems like heart attack. This study aims to determine the effects of continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischemic events during non-cardiac surgery.

Trial Design:
The study included adults scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anesthesia. The participants were taking either a single or dual antiplatelet therapy (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) for at least two weeks. The study compared the outcomes of continuing or discontinuing the antiplatelet therapy for at least five days before surgery. The duration of the study varied depending on the individual patient's surgery.

Results:
The study included a total of five randomized controlled trials involving 666 adults, with three ongoing studies identified. All participants underwent elective general surgery, including procedures like abdominal, urological, orthopedic, and gynecological surgeries. The trials compared the effects of continuing antiplatelet therapy with discontinuing therapy before surgery. Three of the studies had well-designed methods, including randomization and concealed allocation. Three studies were placebo-controlled, reducing bias. The results showed that continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy did not significantly impact mortality up to six months after surgery. The incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion or further surgical intervention was also not significantly affected. There was no clear difference in the occurrence of ischemic events within 30 days of surgery. However, it is important to note that the evidence for these findings is of low or moderate certainty.

In conclusion, based on the available evidence, whether a patient continues or discontinues antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery seems to have little to no effect on mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischemic events. However, it is important to consider the limitations of the study, including the small number of trials and participants, as well as the ongoing studies that may provide more conclusive results in the future. It is recommended that patients consult with their healthcare providers before making any decisions regarding their antiplatelet therapy in preparation for surgery.
