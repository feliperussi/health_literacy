Plain Title: Non-Invasive Respiratory Support for Newborn Breathing Condition

Rationale: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a condition where newborns experience rapid breathing and signs of distress. It usually happens within the first two hours of life in full-term and late preterm babies. This condition can be managed with supportive care, but non-invasive respiratory support may also be given to reduce distress and make breathing easier. The goal of this study was to determine the benefits and potential risks of non-invasive respiratory support for newborns with TTN.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials, which are experiments where participants are randomly assigned to different groups. The trials involved infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days old who had TTN. The study collected data on factors like birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, and the need for different types of respiratory support. The researchers assessed the evidence using a system called GRADE.

Results: The study included three trials involving 150 infants. Each trial compared different types of non-invasive respiratory support. The results varied depending on the comparison made. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) did not have a significant effect on the need for mechanical ventilation or the incidence of pneumothorax (a lung condition). However, CPAP did reduce the duration of tachypnea (rapid breathing) compared to free oxygen. Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation or the incidence of pneumothorax compared to CPAP. The duration of tachypnea did not differ either. In the trial comparing nasal high-frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation or pneumothorax occurred. The duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high-frequency ventilation group. However, the certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision and unclear bias risks.

Conclusion: Based on the limited and low-quality evidence available, it is unclear whether non-invasive respiratory support is beneficial or harmful for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn. While some trials showed a shorter duration of tachypnea, there were no significant differences in important outcomes among the different groups. More research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive respiratory support for this condition.
