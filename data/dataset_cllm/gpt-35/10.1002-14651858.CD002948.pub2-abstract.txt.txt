Plain Title: Herbal Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis: Benefits and Side Effects

Rationale: Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition that causes pain, disability, and other symptoms for those who have it. Herbal medicines have shown potential in treating this condition. This study aimed to update a previous review of herbal therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, in order to gather more information and determine if these therapies are effective.

Trial Design: The study involved searching various databases for randomized controlled trials that compared herbal interventions to placebos or other active treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers included 22 studies in their analysis, with 12 new studies added to the update. These studies involved different herbal treatments and were conducted over several years.

Results: The results of the study showed that certain herbal interventions may provide benefits for rheumatoid arthritis patients. Specifically, oils containing gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from evening primrose, borage, or blackcurrant seed oil were found to reduce pain intensity and improve disability. However, there was an increase in adverse events associated with GLA use, although it was not statistically significant. Another herbal therapy, Tripterygium wilfordii (thunder god vine), showed improvements in some outcomes, but the data could not be combined due to differences in interventions and comparisons. Oral use of Tripterygium wilfordii was associated with serious side effects in one study, but these side effects were mild to moderate and resolved after stopping the treatment. Phytodolor® N, another herbal therapy, had limited data available for analysis due to poor reporting. Other herbal interventions were also considered but had differing results.

Conclusions: The study concluded that some herbal interventions for rheumatoid arthritis lack strong evidence from well-designed studies. However, there is moderate evidence that oils containing GLA can provide relief for symptoms. The effectiveness of Phytodolor® N is less convincing, and Tripterygium wilfordii products may reduce symptoms but can come with side effects. Many trials of herbal therapies have flaws in their design and reporting. Therefore, further research is needed, particularly through well-designed clinical trials that follow specific guidelines for measuring outcomes and reporting results.

In summary, this study reviewed various herbal therapies for rheumatoid arthritis. It found that oils containing GLA may provide some benefits, while Tripterygium wilfordii products may also help but can have side effects. The efficacy of Phytodolor® N is inconclusive. However, more high-quality research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness and safety of these herbal therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.
