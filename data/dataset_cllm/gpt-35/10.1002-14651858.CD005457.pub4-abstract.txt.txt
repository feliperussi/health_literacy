Plain Title: Comparing the Effectiveness and Side Effects of Different Medicines for Preventing Postpartum Haemorrhage

Rationale: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Active management during labor has been shown to be effective in preventing PPH. Carbetocin, an oxytocin agonist, shows promise in preventing PPH. This study aims to determine if carbetocin is as effective as other medicines for preventing PPH and to find the best ways to administer carbetocin.

Trial Design: The study included 11 trials involving 2,635 women. Some trials compared carbetocin with oxytocin for women undergoing caesarean deliveries, while others compared carbetocin with intramuscular syntometrine for women having vaginal deliveries. The dosages varied among the trials. Data was collected and analyzed from these trials.

Results: The use of carbetocin resulted in a significant reduction in the need for additional medicines to stop bleeding during caesarean deliveries compared to oxytocin. Carbetocin also resulted in less uterine massage needed after both caesarean and vaginal deliveries compared to oxytocin. There were no significant differences in the risk of PPH or severe PPH between carbetocin and oxytocin. However, carbetocin was associated with less blood loss compared to syntometrine for women having vaginal deliveries. Carbetocin also had fewer side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, compared to both oxytocin and syntometrine. Furthermore, carbetocin was associated with a lower risk of postpartum hypertension compared to syntometrine. More research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of carbetocin as a treatment for PPH.

In conclusion, carbetocin is comparable to other medicines for preventing PPH. It is more effective than oxytocin for women having caesarean deliveries, resulting in less need for additional medicines. It also leads to less blood loss and fewer side effects compared to syntometrine for women having vaginal deliveries. However, further research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of carbetocin.
