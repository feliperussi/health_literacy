Plain Title: Comparison of Two Botulinum Toxins for Treating Cervical Dystonia

Rationale: Cervical dystonia is a condition where people experience painful involuntary head movements. Botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is the usual treatment, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is also an option. We wanted to compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of BtA and BtB in people with cervical dystonia to see if one is better than the other.

Trial Design: We searched for studies that compared BtA and BtB in adults with cervical dystonia. We found three studies of low quality that included a total of 270 participants. The studies evaluated the effects of a single treatment session with different doses of BtA and BtB. The participants already had a positive response to BtA treatment.

Results: We found that there was no significant difference in effectiveness between BtA and BtB. Both treatments were equally effective in reducing symptoms of cervical dystonia. However, treatment with BtB had a higher risk of sore throat/dry mouth compared to BtA. Other side effects and outcomes were similar between the two treatments. 

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, a single treatment session of either BtA or BtB is equally effective and safe for treating cervical dystonia. However, BtB may have a higher risk of causing sore throat/dry mouth. Overall, there is no strong evidence to support the use of one type of botulinum toxin over the other for treating cervical dystonia.
