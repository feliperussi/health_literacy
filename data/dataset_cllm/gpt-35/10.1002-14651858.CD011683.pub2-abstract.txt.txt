Plain Title: Effectiveness of Mass Media Interventions for Different Ethnic Groups in Changing Behaviors for Health

Rationale:
Physical activity, a healthy diet, avoiding tobacco exposure, and limited alcohol consumption can help prevent illnesses that are not easily transmitted (non-communicable diseases). Mass media interventions are often used to encourage healthier behaviors in different groups of people. However, it is unclear whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more or less effective in changing behaviors compared to interventions for the general population. This study aims to determine the effects of mass media interventions on adult ethnic minorities to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases.

Trial Design:
To study the effects of mass media interventions, researchers reviewed various scientific databases and sources until August and October 2016. They looked for studies that focused on individual and group experiments, as well as controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies. The interventions in focus encouraged healthier behaviors related to physical activity, diet, tobacco use, or alcohol consumption. These interventions were delivered through mass media channels and targeted ethnic minority groups. The participants were adults aged 18 years and older from ethnic minority groups living in different countries. The primary outcomes measured were changes in behavior, self-reported behavior change, knowledge and attitudes towards change. Secondary outcomes included the use of health promotion services and project costs. 

Results:
Six studies met the inclusion criteria for this study. These studies were conducted in the USA and targeted African Americans, Spanish-language dominant Latino immigrants, and Chinese immigrants. Three of the studies were specifically for women, with one of them targeting pregnant women. The researchers found that the studies had some biases in their design and execution. 

The first comparison looked at mass media interventions targeting ethnic minorities versus interventions intended for the general population. One study found little difference in behavior change between participants who received culturally specific materials and those who received materials for the general population. The evidence for this was of low quality. No study provided information on behavior change indicators or adverse effects.

The second comparison examined targeted mass media interventions versus no intervention. One study found that participants who received the intervention had similar changes in body mass index compared to those who did not receive the intervention. The evidence for this was of low quality. Two other studies showed that radio advertisements targeted towards African American communities increased the use of health promotion services, such as smoking quit lines. The evidence for this was of moderate quality. 

The third comparison compared targeted mass media interventions with personalized content to mass media interventions without personalized content. The evidence for this was of low quality. Information on costs was limited and no study provided data on adverse effects.

The conclusions drawn from these studies were that the current evidence is not enough to determine if mass media interventions for ethnic minority populations are more effective than those for the general population. Although targeted interventions may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, their impact on health behaviors remains unclear. Future studies should explore interventions for ethnic minorities with different languages, as well as directly compare targeted interventions to those for the general population.
