Plain Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Intravenous Ketorolac for Postoperative Pain

Rationale: Postoperative pain can be severe and is often managed with opioids, which can lead to adverse events. This study aimed to evaluate the use of intravenous ketorolac as an alternative treatment for moderate to severe postoperative pain. Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can potentially reduce opioid requirements and minimize opioid-induced adverse events.

Trial Design: This study included 12 randomized double-blind trials involving 1905 adult participants who underwent various surgeries. The age of the study population ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Participants received a single dose of intravenous ketorolac or a placebo or another active treatment. The efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed over a four- to six-hour period. The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using standardized procedures.

Results: The findings showed that intravenous ketorolac provided significant pain relief for most patients compared to placebo. The number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours was significantly higher with ketorolac. The same was observed for pain relief over six hours. Time to use rescue medication was longer for participants who received ketorolac. Adverse event rates were slightly higher with ketorolac compared to placebo or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but serious adverse events were rare. The evidence also suggested that there may be little or no difference between ketorolac and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in terms of pain relief and rescue medication use.

Conclusions: The use of intravenous ketorolac can provide substantial pain relief for most patients with postoperative pain. However, the certainty of evidence varies across different outcomes and comparators, ranging from very low to moderate. Adverse events occurred slightly more frequently with ketorolac, but further research is needed to fully understand its safety profile, especially in specific populations such as elderly individuals and those undergoing cardiovascular surgeries. Overall, intravenous ketorolac appears to be a promising option for managing postoperative pain, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
