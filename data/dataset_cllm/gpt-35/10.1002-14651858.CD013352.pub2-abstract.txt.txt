Plain Title: Comparing Two Techniques for Removing Uterine Fibroids during Laparoscopic Myomectomy

Rationale: Uterine fibroids are common benign tumors in women that can cause symptoms and complications. Laparoscopic myomectomy is a surgery used to remove these fibroids. However, there are limitations to this approach, such as difficulty removing large fibroids. To address this challenge, a technique called power morcellation was developed, but it carries the risk of spreading cancer cells. In-bag morcellation is a strategy that may prevent the spread of tissue fragments and improve safety.

Trial Design: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of in-bag morcellation to power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. Premenopausal women with fibroids were included in the study. The participants were divided into two groups: one group underwent in-bag manual morcellation, where the fibroids were placed in a bag and manually broken down, while the other group underwent power morcellation. The study assessed outcomes such as complications, operative time, ease of morcellation, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, conversion to laparotomy, and the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

Results: Two trials involving 176 premenopausal women with fibroids were included in the study. There were no intraoperative complications reported in either group. The results regarding operative time and ease of morcellation were inconclusive due to low-quality evidence. However, there were no postoperative diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma in either group. The quality of the evidence was limited due to the small sample sizes and other limitations.

Conclusion: There is limited data to determine the effectiveness and safety of in-bag morcellation compared to power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The study could not establish if in-bag morcellation improves operative time or ease of morcellation. However, no cases of leiomyosarcoma were identified. Further large-scale trials are needed to provide more conclusive evidence on these techniques.
