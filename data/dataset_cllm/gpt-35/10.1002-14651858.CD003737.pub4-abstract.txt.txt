Plain Title: Treatments for Intermittent Exotropia: What Works?

Rationale: Intermittent exotropia (X(T)) is a condition where the eyes turn outward. It can cause problems with vision and may affect a person's ability to see clearly. There are different treatment options available, but it is not clear which one is the most effective. This study aimed to analyze the effects of different treatments for intermittent exotropia and to determine if the treatment works better for certain age groups or types of X(T). Understanding the best treatment options for intermittent exotropia is important for improving the quality of life for patients.

Trial Design: The study looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested different surgical and non-surgical treatments for intermittent exotropia. The researchers searched various databases to find these trials. The study included a total of 890 participants, most of whom were children between the ages of 12 months and 10 years. The trials took place in the United States, Turkey, and India. The participants were followed for a certain period of time to see the effects of the treatments.

Results: The study found that bilateral lateral rectus recession, a surgical procedure, did not show a significant difference in motor alignment of the eyes at near and distance fixation compared to a procedure called unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection. Patching, a non-surgical treatment where one eye is covered to improve alignment, was found to be more effective than active observation in improving motor alignment at near and distance fixation. However, patching did not have a significant effect on stereoacuity, which is the ability to see in three dimensions. Adverse events were not reported for patching. Other treatments, such as prism adaptation test prior to eye muscle surgery, did not show enough evidence to determine if they were beneficial.

Conclusion: Overall, the study suggests that patching can be a beneficial treatment for children with intermittent exotropia aged 12 months to 10 years. It improves the alignment of the eyes, which can help with vision. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other treatments. This study provides important information for doctors and patients to make informed decisions about the best treatment options for intermittent exotropia.
