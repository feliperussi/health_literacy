Plain Language Summary:
1. Plain Title: The Effectiveness and Safety of Antimicrobial Dressings in Reducing Infections in Newborn Babies with Catheters.
2. Rationale: Babies sometimes need a tube called a central venous catheter (CVC) for medical treatment. These tubes can cause infections. Antimicrobial dressings, which have medicine in them, might help prevent these infections. But we need to know if they are safe and effective for newborn babies.
3. Trial Design: We looked at studies that compared antimicrobial dressings to other dressings or no dressing at all in newborn babies with catheters. We found three studies with a total of 855 babies. The studies were done in neonatal intensive care units. We assessed the risk of bias in each study and analyzed the results using risk difference and risk ratio.
4. Results: The first study compared two types of dressings. It found that there was no significant difference in the risk of infection between the groups. However, the dressing with the medicine was better at preventing bacteria from growing on the catheter. But babies in this group were more likely to develop a skin rash. 
In the second study, two types of dressings were compared. There were no significant differences in the risk of infection or death between the groups. No skin reactions were reported.
In conclusion, the use of antimicrobial dressings with medicine may help prevent bacteria from growing on catheters, but it does not seem to reduce the risk of infection or death more than other dressings. However, these dressings can cause skin rashes in some babies. More research is needed to determine the best way to prevent infections in newborns with catheters.
