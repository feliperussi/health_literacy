1. Plain Title: Efficacy and Safety of Cough Augmentation Techniques for Neuromuscular Disorders
2. Rationale: People with neuromuscular disorders often have weak coughs, which can lead to respiratory problems. Cough augmentation techniques aim to improve cough effectiveness, reduce respiratory infections, and enhance quality of life. This study aims to determine if these techniques are effective and safe for adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders.
3. Trial Design: The study searched for randomized controlled trials comparing cough augmentation techniques to no treatment or alternative techniques. It included 11 studies with 287 participants, ranging in age from three to 73 years. The trials assessed various techniques, such as manual-assisted cough, mechanical insufflation, and breathstacking. The duration of the study varied depending on the individual trial.
4. Results: The review found that cough augmentation techniques may increase peak cough flow compared to unassisted cough, but the evidence is uncertain. There was no significant difference in peak cough flow between alternative cough augmentation techniques. The studies did not provide enough evidence to determine the effect of these techniques on measures of gaseous exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life, general function, or participant preference and satisfaction. Due to limitations in the included studies, the safety and efficacy of cough augmentation techniques for neuromuscular disorders remain uncertain. Further research is needed to provide more definitive conclusions.
