Plain Title: Accuracy of Tests for Detecting Tuberculosis and Rifampicin Resistance

Rationale: Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that causes many deaths worldwide. Current tests for detecting tuberculosis often miss cases, resulting in delayed treatment and further spread of the disease. We wanted to see if a single test could be used to accurately screen for tuberculosis, even in people without symptoms. This would help to close the gap in diagnosing tuberculosis and improve case detection.

Trial Design: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases to find studies that evaluated the accuracy of two tests, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, for detecting tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. The studies included adults in high-risk groups, such as people living with HIV or those in close contact with tuberculosis patients, as well as the general population. We analyzed the data from these studies using a statistical model to estimate the sensitivity (ability to correctly identify positive cases) and specificity (ability to correctly identify negative cases) of the tests.

Results: We included a total of 21 studies in our analysis. In people living with HIV, Xpert MTB/RIF had a sensitivity of 61.8% and a specificity of 98.8% for detecting tuberculosis. This means that out of 1000 people, 40 would test positive for tuberculosis when they don't actually have it, and 19 would test negative when they do have it. Xpert Ultra showed slightly higher sensitivity but similar specificity in this group. In non-hospitalized individuals in high-risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF had a sensitivity of 69.4% and a specificity of 98.8% for detecting tuberculosis. Unfortunately, we did not find any studies that evaluated these tests in the general population. For detecting rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 94-100%.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Xpert MTB/RIF can be an accurate screening test for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings, particularly in people living with HIV and non-hospitalized individuals in high-risk groups. Xpert Ultra may have slightly better sensitivity than Xpert MTB/RIF, but more research is needed to confirm this. However, we did not find any studies that evaluated these tests in other high-risk groups or in the general population. This highlights the need for further research in these areas. Overall, these tests have the potential to improve tuberculosis case detection and help in the fight against this deadly disease.
