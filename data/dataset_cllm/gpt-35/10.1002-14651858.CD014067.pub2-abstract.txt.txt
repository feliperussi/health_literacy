Plain Title: Using Probiotics and Prebiotics to Reduce the Risk of a Serious Gut Condition in Premature Babies

Rationale: Preterm or very low birth weight infants are at risk of developing a serious condition called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), which affects the gut. Intestinal dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut bacteria, may contribute to the development of NEC. This study aimed to investigate whether giving premature babies a combination of probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and prebiotics (food for the bacteria) could reduce the risk of NEC and its associated complications and death.

Trial Design: The researchers conducted a systematic search of various medical databases and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the use of synbiotics (combination of probiotics and prebiotics) with a placebo or no synbiotics in premature or very low birth weight infants. They evaluated the risk of bias in the trials and collected and analyzed data using statistical methods. The study included a total of six trials involving 925 infants. The synbiotics used in these trials contained lactobacilli or bifidobacteria combined with fructo- or galacto-oligosaccharides.

Results: The analysis of the trials showed that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC. Specifically, it was found that the risk of NEC was 70 fewer cases per 1000 infants treated with synbiotics compared to those who did not receive synbiotics. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 14, meaning that for every 14 infants treated with synbiotics, one case of NEC could be prevented. Synbiotics also showed a potential benefit in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, with 50 fewer deaths per 1000 infants treated. However, the certainty of these findings is low, and larger, high-quality trials are needed to confirm the effects of synbiotics on NEC and mortality in premature infants. The effects of synbiotics on other outcomes, such as late-onset invasive infection and neurodevelopmental impairment, remain uncertain and require further investigation.

Conclusion: The current evidence from the available trials suggests that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC and all-cause mortality in very preterm or very low birth weight infants. However, the certainty of these findings is limited, and larger trials of higher quality are needed to provide more reliable evidence. This information is crucial for informing policies and practices related to the use of synbiotics in the care of premature infants.
