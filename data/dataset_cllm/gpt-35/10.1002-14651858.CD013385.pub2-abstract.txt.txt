Plain Title: The Effects of Decision Coaching on Healthcare Decision Making

Rationale: 
Making healthcare decisions can be difficult, and patients may need guidance and support. Decision coaching is a type of support provided by healthcare providers to help patients actively participate in their healthcare decisions. However, little is known about how effective decision coaching is. In this study, researchers wanted to determine the effects of decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member, compared to usual care or other interventions. The goal was to understand how decision coaching can help patients prepare for decision making, address their decisional needs, and identify any potential adverse effects.

Trial Design: 
The study included randomized controlled trials involving adults or children who were preparing to make a healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was provided individually by a trained healthcare provider and aimed to provide non-directive support. The study compared decision coaching to usual care or other interventions. The researchers searched multiple databases to find relevant studies. They analyzed the data from the included studies using statistical methods to determine the treatment effects and the certainty of the evidence.

Results: 
The researchers included 28 studies in their analysis, involving a total of 5509 adult participants. These studies evaluated decision coaching for various healthcare decisions, such as cancer treatment, menopause, mental illness, and genetic testing. When compared to usual care, decision coaching did not show a clear improvement in outcomes such as decision making preparation, confidence, knowledge, regret, or anxiety. When compared to evidence-based information only, decision coaching had little to no effect on knowledge or anxiety, but the certainty of the evidence was low. When decision coaching was combined with evidence-based information and compared to usual care or evidence-based information only, there was some evidence of improved knowledge, but the certainty of the evidence was low. The researchers did not find any significant adverse effects associated with decision coaching.

In conclusion, decision coaching may improve participants' knowledge when used in combination with evidence-based information. However, more research is needed to understand its effectiveness for other outcomes. It is also unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence-informed information. Overall, decision coaching has the potential to support patients in making healthcare decisions, but further studies are necessary to explore its benefits and limitations for a broader range of outcomes.
