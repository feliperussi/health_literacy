Plain Title: Animal-Assisted Therapy for People with Dementia

Rationale: Dementia is a chronic condition that affects memory, cognitive functions, social behavior, and daily activities. Current treatments only address the symptoms of the disease and do not prevent its progression. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a new therapeutic strategy that has shown promise in improving psychological symptoms and behaviors in people with dementia.

Trial Design: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal-assisted therapy for people with dementia. The researchers conducted a systematic search of various databases to identify relevant clinical trials. They included randomized controlled trials that compared AAT with no AAT, AAT using live animals with alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT with other active interventions. They assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the studies and collected data using standard methods. Nine trials involving 305 participants with dementia were included in the analysis. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, with therapy sessions lasting between 10 and 90 minutes. The studies used different instruments to measure the outcomes.

Results: Comparing AAT with no AAT, the participants who received AAT showed a slight reduction in depressive symptoms, but there was no improvement in their quality of life. There were no clear differences in social functioning, problematic behavior, agitation, activities of daily living, and self-care ability. The studies had low to moderate certainty in their results. Comparing AAT using live animals with robotic animals, the duration of physical contact was longer in participants who received AAT with live animals, but there were no clear differences in behavior or quality of life. Comparing AAT using live animals with a soft toy cat, there was a slight difference in the duration of contact and talking, but the evidence was of low certainty.

The study concluded that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia, but there is no clear evidence of its effects on other outcomes. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very-low to moderate. The study did not find any evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia cannot be determined conclusively. Further well-conducted randomized controlled trials are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. These trials should address blinding issues, clearly document allocation methods, and include important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.
