1. Plain Title: Effects of Posterior Musculofascial Reconstruction on Urinary Continence After Prostate Cancer Surgery
2. Rationale: Prostate cancer treatment can lead to delayed recovery of urinary continence, causing discomfort for patients. This study aims to compare the effects of reconstructive surgery on urinary continence after prostate surgery to understand if it improves patients' condition.
3. Trial Design: The study involved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants who underwent different surgical techniques for posterior musculofascial reconstruction during prostate cancer surgery. The study included men with clinically localized prostate cancer and assessed their urinary continence recovery at different time points after surgery.
4. Results: The study found that posterior musculofascial reconstruction surgery may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no reconstruction. However, it may not have a significant effect on continence three months after surgery. The surgery was found to have little to no impact on serious adverse events. Additionally, the study showed that the surgery may not affect long-term continence recovery, potency recovery, positive surgical margins, or biochemical recurrence. It is important to note that the certainty of evidence for these outcomes was limited due to study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency.
