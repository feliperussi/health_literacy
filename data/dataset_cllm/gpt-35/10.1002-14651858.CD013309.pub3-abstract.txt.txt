Plain Title: Benefits and Harms of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Premature Infants

Rationale: Premature infants are at risk of experiencing high or low blood sugar levels, which can negatively affect their neurodevelopment. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices have the potential to maintain glucose levels within a normal range and reduce the need for frequent blood sampling. However, it is important to assess the benefits and potential harms of using CGM in premature infants.

Trial Design: This study aimed to compare the benefits and harms of CGM versus intermittent methods of measuring blood sugar levels in premature infants who are at risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The study included randomized controlled trials and quasi-RCTs. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed, and the treatment effects were evaluated using specific criteria. The certainty of the evidence was also assessed.

Results: Four trials involving 300 infants were included in the review. CGM was compared to intermittent methods of measuring blood sugar levels in premature infants at risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. However, one trial analyzed CGM separately as a standalone device. There were no studies conducted in premature infants with proven hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. None of the included trials reported the primary outcome of neurodevelopmental outcomes or seizures. The impact of CGM on mortality during hospitalization is uncertain. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was very low due to study design limitations and imprecise estimates. There is an ongoing study that is expected to be completed in 2022, which may provide additional information. 

Authors' Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of CGM on premature infant mortality or morbidities. The safety of CGM and the available management algorithms are uncertain, and many morbidities have not been adequately reported. All four included studies enrolled premature infants at risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, but no studies were conducted in infants with proven hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Long-term outcomes were not reported. A clinical trial is necessary to identify the most effective CGM and glycaemic management regimens in premature infants, before larger studies can be conducted to assess the efficacy of CGM in reducing mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments.
