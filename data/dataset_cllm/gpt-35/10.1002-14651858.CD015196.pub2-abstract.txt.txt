Plain Title: The Effects of Anticholinergic Medications on Older Adults with Dementia or Cognitive Impairment

Rationale: Older adults with dementia or cognitive impairment often take medications with anticholinergic properties. These medications can have a cumulative effect, known as the anticholinergic burden, which may cause adverse effects. We wanted to determine if a high anticholinergic burden is a risk factor for further cognitive decline or neuropsychiatric disturbances in these individuals. Identifying modifiable prognostic factors for these outcomes is important since neuropsychiatric disturbances are a common complication of dementia that often require hospitalization.

Trial Design: We conducted a review of studies that examined the association between anticholinergic burden and adverse clinical outcomes in older adults with pre-existing diagnoses of dementia or cognitive impairment. We included both prospective and retrospective studies with a minimum one-month follow-up. We searched various databases for relevant studies.

Results: We identified 18 studies involving 102,684 older adults that met our inclusion criteria. Five different measurement scales were used to assess anticholinergic burden. Some studies reported a significantly increased risk of greater long-term cognitive decline for participants with a high anticholinergic burden. However, no studies investigated neuropsychiatric disturbances as an outcome. There was some evidence suggesting a significant association between anticholinergic burden and reduced physical function in older adults. No study found a significant association with the risk of institutionalization. Six studies reported a significantly increased risk of mortality for those with a high anticholinergic burden. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, we found that older adults with dementia or cognitive impairment and a significant anticholinergic burden may be at increased risk of death. However, we could not draw firm conclusions regarding the risk of cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric disturbances, decline in physical function, or institutionalization. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of anticholinergic medications on these outcomes in this population.
