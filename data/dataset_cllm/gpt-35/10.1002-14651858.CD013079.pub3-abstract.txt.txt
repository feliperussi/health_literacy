Plain Title: Antibiotic Therapy for Chronic Infection in Cystic Fibrosis: Findings from a Review

Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects multiple organs in the body. One of the most common complications of CF is chronic lung infection, which can lead to a decline in lung function over time. In particular, infection by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) poses a significant challenge for patients with CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review aims to assess the effects of long-term antibiotic therapy specifically targeted against chronic BCC lung infections in people with CF. The main goal is to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments in improving lung function and reducing exacerbation rates. Additionally, we will examine any adverse events, changes in quality of life, and mortality associated with the treatment.

Trial Design: This review analyzed the existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused on long-term antibiotic therapy for CF patients with chronic BCC infection. We searched various databases and sources for relevant articles and reviews. The search was conducted up until April 12, 2021. Two authors independently collected data from the selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system.

Results: Our analysis included one RCT involving 100 participants who were followed for a total of 52 weeks. The study compared continuous inhaled aztreonam lysine (AZLI) with a placebo. The trial consisted of a double-blind phase of 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week open-label extension, and a four-week follow-up period. The average age of participants was 26.3 years, with 61% being male. The participants had an average lung function of 56.5% predicted.

The results showed that treatment with AZLI for 24 weeks did not result in a significant improvement in lung function, as measured by the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The median time to the next exacerbation was not significantly different between the AZLI and placebo groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the number of participants hospitalized for respiratory exacerbations between the two groups. The occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups. The study also did not find any significant differences in mortality, quality of life, or sputum density between the treatment groups.

In terms of methodological quality, the overall risk of bias in the study was assessed to be unclear to low risk.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, we found insufficient data to determine an effective strategy for antibiotic therapy specifically targeted at treating chronic BCC infection in individuals with CF. Further research is needed to better understand the potential benefits and risks of long-term antibiotic treatment for this condition.
