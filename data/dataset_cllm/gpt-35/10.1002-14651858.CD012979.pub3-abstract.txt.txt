Plain Title: Comparing Medical Treatments for Chronic Rhinosinusitis in Cystic Fibrosis Patients 

Rationale: Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common problem in people with cystic fibrosis. There are many different treatments available, such as nasal saline irrigations, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and CFTR modulators. However, it is unclear how effective these treatments are. That's why this study was done - to compare the effects of different medical treatments in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. 

Trial Design: The study looked at different medical treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. The researchers searched for relevant studies in medical databases and other sources. They looked for randomized trials that compared different treatments to each other, or to no treatment or a placebo. Unfortunately, they did not find any trials that met their criteria.

Results: The researchers did not find any eligible trials that assessed the medical treatments for cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. They did find some new references, but none of them were able to be included in the review. The study concludes that more high-quality trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of the treatments mentioned above for managing chronic rhinosinusitis and improving the lives of people with cystic fibrosis.
