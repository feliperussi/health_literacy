Plain Title: Whole-Body Cryotherapy for Reducing Muscle Soreness after Exercise: A Review of the Evidence

Rationale: Many people experience muscle soreness after exercising. Whole-body cryotherapy is a treatment that involves exposing the body to extremely cold air in a specialized chamber. It is believed to help reduce muscle soreness. This study aimed to assess the benefits and harms of whole-body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults.

Trial Design: The researchers reviewed randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared whole-body cryotherapy with other interventions or no treatment. They looked at the effects of whole-body cryotherapy on muscle soreness, subjective recovery (such as tiredness and well-being), and adverse effects. The trials included physically active young adults, primarily males, and used different approaches to whole-body cryotherapy.

Results: The review included four trials with a total of 64 participants. The trials had limitations that may affect the reliability of their findings. The evidence quality was classified as "very low." The trials compared whole-body cryotherapy with rest or no cryotherapy. The results showed some evidence that whole-body cryotherapy may lead to lower muscle soreness scores at certain time points, but the results were not consistent and there were no significant differences between groups. One small trial compared whole-body cryotherapy with far-infrared therapy and found some evidence that cryotherapy led to lower muscle soreness and less tiredness at certain time points, but again, the results were not consistent. There were no reported adverse events.

Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, it is unclear whether whole-body cryotherapy reduces muscle soreness or improves recovery after exercise compared to rest or no cryotherapy in physically active young adult males. There is also no evidence on the use of this treatment in females or elite athletes. It is important to note that the potential risks of extreme cold exposure have not been well-studied. More high-quality research is needed in this area, including studies that report detailed adverse events.
