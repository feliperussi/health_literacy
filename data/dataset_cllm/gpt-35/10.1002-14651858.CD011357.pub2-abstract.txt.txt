Plain Title: Antibiotic Treatment for Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Benefits and Harms

Rationale: Asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is the presence of bacteria in the urine without any signs of infection, is common in kidney transplant recipients and may increase the risk of developing a urinary tract infection. However, there is no consensus on whether antibiotics should be used to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients. This study aims to determine if treating asymptomatic bacteriuria with antibiotics can prevent symptomatic infections, reduce mortality, and improve kidney transplant outcomes.

Trial Design: This study involves randomized controlled trials and quasi‚ÄêRCTs. It includes kidney transplant recipients who have asymptomatic bacteriuria at any time after transplantation. The study will assess the effects of antibiotic treatment on the incidence of symptomatic infections, antimicrobial resistance, mortality, graft loss, graft rejection, graft function, hospitalization for urinary tract infections, adverse reactions to antibiotics, and persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The study will also collect data on patient demographics and the duration of the study.

Results: The analysis included two studies with a total of 212 participants, comparing antibiotic treatment to no treatment, and identified three ongoing studies. The incidence of symptomatic infections ranged from 19% to 31% in the groups not treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotic treatment showed uncertain effects in preventing symptomatic infections. The risk of developing multidrug-resistant organisms was also uncertain with antibiotic treatment. Persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was high regardless of treatment. Antibiotics had uncertain effects on other important outcomes such as mortality, graft loss, acute rejection, hospitalization for urinary tract infections, graft function, and adverse reactions. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was low.

Conclusions:Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support routine antibiotic treatment for kidney transplant recipients with asymptomatic bacteriuria. However, more studies are needed to inform clinical practice. We are awaiting the results of three ongoing randomized studies that may provide more conclusive findings and help resolve the current uncertainties.
