Plain Title: First Aid Interventions for Acute Oral Poisoning: A Review of the Evidence

Rationale: Oral poisoning is a serious problem that causes many deaths and disabilities every year, particularly among children under five years old. Laypeople can help save lives by using effective interventions to limit the effects of poison before professional help arrives. This study aimed to assess the effects of pre-hospital interventions that are feasible for laypeople to use.

Trial Design: The study included 24 trials involving 7,099 participants. The trials examined various interventions for treating acute oral poisoning before professional help arrives. The participants were both adults and children with different types of poisoning. The study lasted for a specific period of time.

Results: The study found that there is limited evidence regarding the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. Many of the included trials had limitations in their design and reporting. Most of the evidence collected was of low or very low certainty due to indirectness, risk of bias, or imprecision. The study did not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the interventions.

In conclusion, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. The evidence collected from this study is not sufficient to make any firm conclusions.
