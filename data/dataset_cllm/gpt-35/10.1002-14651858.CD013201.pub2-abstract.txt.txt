Plain Title: Stem Cell Therapy for Brain Bleeding in Premature Babies

Rationale: Bleeding in the brain is a serious problem for premature babies in neonatal intensive care units around the world. Current treatments for this condition are limited. However, stem cell therapy shows promise as a potential way to repair and regenerate damaged brain tissue. This study aims to investigate the benefits and risks of using stem cell-based interventions to prevent or treat brain bleeding in preterm infants.

Trial Design: This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GM-IVH) in preterm infants. GM-IVH is a type of brain bleeding that occurs in premature babies. The study will include randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. The participants will be extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation) without a diagnosis of GM-IVH for prevention studies, and preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) with a diagnosis of GM-IVH for treatment studies. The study will collect data on the number of participants, their birth weight, gestational age, the type and source of stem cells used, and other stem cell-based interventions. The review authors will assess the risk of bias and use the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence.

Results: Our search yielded 769 references, but we did not find any completed studies to include in the analysis. However, there is one ongoing randomized controlled trial and five phase 1 trials that have been excluded from this review. Therefore, currently, there is no available evidence to support the benefits or risks of stem cell-based interventions for the treatment or prevention of GM-IVH in preterm infants.

In conclusion, more research is needed to determine if stem cell therapy can effectively treat brain bleeding in premature babies. This study aims to fill the existing gap in knowledge and provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and risks of using stem cell-based interventions for GM-IVH.
