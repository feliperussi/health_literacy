Plain Title: Comparing Surgical and Medical Treatments for Abdominal Aortic Graft Infections

Rationale: Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, with high rates of illness and death. These infections can be treated in two ways: through surgery or medical management using antibiotics. However, it is not clear which treatment is the most effective for managing these infections. Surgical techniques, such as in situ replacement of the graft and extra-anatomical bypass, are commonly used. Medical management involves taking antibiotics for a long period of time. Currently, there is no consensus on the best approach for treating abdominal aortic graft infections. This study aims to compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for these infections.

Trial Design: This study assessed and compared the outcomes of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. The researchers searched various databases and trials registers to find relevant studies. Randomized controlled trials that used either surgical or medical interventions to treat these infections were included. The studies' definitions of abdominal aortic graft infections were accepted, including secondary infections caused by aortoenteric fistula. Studies that presented data on infections in general were excluded unless they specifically addressed abdominal aortic graft infections. The researchers planned to assess the bias of the included trials and evaluate the quality of the evidence. The main outcomes of interest were mortality, amputation, graft re-infection, complications related to the graft, graft-related mortality, acute limb ischemia, and need for further intervention.

Results: The researchers did not find any randomized controlled trials to analyze and draw conclusions from. Therefore, there is currently not enough evidence to determine which treatment is better for abdominal aortic graft infections. More research is needed, particularly multicenter clinical trials, to compare the different treatments for this condition.

In conclusion, this study aimed to compare the outcomes of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. However, due to a lack of available evidence, it is currently unclear which treatment is superior. Further research, such as multicenter clinical trials, is necessary to better understand and compare the effectiveness of different treatments for this condition.
