Plain Title: Effects of Interventions to Reduce Harm from Tobacco Smoking

Rationale: We know that quitting smoking is the best way to protect our health, but some people may want to reduce the harm caused by smoking instead. This study looked at different approaches to help smokers reduce their exposure to toxins from smoking. We wanted to find out if these interventions have an effect on long-term health, if they reduce the number of cigarettes smoked, if they help people quit smoking, and if they affect biomarkers of tobacco exposure and damage.

Trial Design: We searched for studies that tested interventions to reduce smoking harm. These studies included smokers who did not want to quit smoking completely. We looked at changes in cigarette consumption, smoking cessation, and markers of health at least six months after starting the intervention. We analyzed the data using standard methods to see if there were any trends or patterns.

Results: From the studies we reviewed, we found that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as gum or inhalers, significantly increased the likelihood of reducing the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50%. It also increased the chances of quitting smoking altogether. However, the evidence for other harm reduction aids, like bupropion or e-cigarettes, was not clear enough to say if they are effective. Some studies showed that reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs) could reduce exposure to harmful substances, but we need more research to understand if this actually lowers the risk of harm. Overall, the quality of the evidence we found was low, so we need more high-quality studies to determine the long-term health effects of these treatments.

In conclusion, this study suggests that interventions like nicotine replacement therapy can help smokers reduce their cigarette consumption and quit smoking, even if they initially didn't plan to. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other harm reduction aids and to understand their long-term effects on health. It is crucial that we conduct more high-quality trials to improve our knowledge about reducing the harm caused by tobacco smoking.
