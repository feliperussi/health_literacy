Plain Title: Comparison of Stoma Placement Techniques for Preventing Herniation and Complications

Rationale: A parastomal hernia is a common complication associated with stomas. It is unclear whether the placement of the enterostomy should be through or lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent herniation and other stoma complications. This study aims to assess if there is a difference in the incidence of parastomal herniation and other stoma complications between lateral pararectal and transrectal stoma placement.

Trial Design: The study included randomized and non-randomized studies comparing the two stoma placement techniques. The participants had elective or emergency abdominal wall enterostomy for various conditions such as rectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, and familial adenomatous polyposis. The study assessed the incidence of parastomal herniation, ileus, stenosis, and skin irritation. Quality of evidence was rated according to established guidelines.

Results: The results from the randomized controlled trials were inconclusive. There was no significant difference between lateral pararectal and transrectal stoma placement in terms of the incidence of parastomal herniation, development of ileus or stenosis, or skin irritation. Subgroup analysis comparing ileostomy and colostomy also did not provide conclusive results. Quality of life was measured but not related to the outcomes of interest. The non-randomized studies also did not show clear effects of the different surgical approaches on herniation or stomal prolapse. No other stoma-related morbidities or mortality were measured.

Conclusion: The available evidence from both randomized and non-randomized studies does not support the superiority of one stoma placement technique over the other in terms of preventing herniation or other complications. There is still a lack of high-quality evidence to determine the ideal surgical technique for stoma formation. Further research is needed in this area.
