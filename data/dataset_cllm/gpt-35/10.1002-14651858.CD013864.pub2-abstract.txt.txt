Plain Title: Antibiotic Regimens for Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia in Children

Rationale: Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a common infection in children that can occur during their stay in the hospital. Our knowledge about this condition is mainly based on studies in adults, and there is a lack of research specifically focused on neonates and children. We need to understand the benefits and risks of different antibiotic treatments for hospital-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children.

Trial Design: This study was designed to assess the effects of various antibiotic regimens for hospital-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. We searched different databases and trial registers for relevant studies. We included randomized clinical trials that compared one antibiotic regimen with another. We collected data from the included studies and evaluated their quality. The duration of participation in the study varied depending on each trial.

Results: We analyzed four randomized clinical trials that involved a total of 84 participants. Unfortunately, all of the trials had a high risk of bias, which means their results may not be completely reliable. We were unable to conduct a meta-analysis because the trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. Each trial assessed a different comparison of antibiotics. Only one trial reported on the primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, while three trials reported on the secondary outcome of treatment failure. The evidence for each comparison was of very low certainty, and it was difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the results. Health-related quality of life, pneumonia-related mortality, and non-serious adverse events were not assessed in any of the trials.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, we cannot determine which antibiotic regimen is superior for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. More randomized clinical trials that specifically focus on different antibiotic regimens for this condition are needed. The current evidence is not sufficient to support the use of one antibiotic regimen over another.
