Plain Title: Benefits and Harms of Nutritional Supplements for Non-Alcohol-Related Fatty Liver Disease

Rationale:
Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where fat builds up in the liver. It affects a significant number of people, and it can lead to serious health problems like liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Currently, there are no recommended nutritional supplements for people with NAFLD. This study aimed to find out if different nutritional supplements could be helpful for treating NAFLD.

Trial Design:
The study included 202 trials involving 14,200 participants with NAFLD. The trials lasted from 1 month to 28 months. They compared 32 different interventions to see which ones were effective. The study included people of different ages and health conditions, as long as they had NAFLD.

Results:
The results showed that the evidence is uncertain about the effects of nutritional supplements on the outcomes of NAFLD. However, some findings were observed. People taking polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements may be more likely to experience adverse events compared to those not taking any intervention. Other nutritional supplements also showed higher numbers of adverse events. The evidence for the effects of other antioxidants on liver cirrhosis was also uncertain. 

Overall, the study concluded that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the benefits and harms of nutritional supplements for NAFLD. More high-quality studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to better understand the effects of interventions like vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, and PUFAs on outcomes like mortality, quality of life, and the need for liver transplantation. These studies should also consider resource utilization and costs.

In summary, this study investigated the effects of different nutritional supplements on NAFLD. While the results are uncertain, there may be potential risks associated with certain supplements. Further research is needed to determine the true benefits and harms of these supplements for people with NAFLD.
