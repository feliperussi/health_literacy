Plain Title: Effectiveness of Treatments for Symptom Relief in COVID-19 Patients: A Comprehensive Review

Rationale: COVID-19 patients often experience distressing symptoms such as breathlessness and delirium. Palliative symptom management can help alleviate these symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. While various treatment options have been discussed, guidance on symptom management in COVID-19 patients is often based on experiences with other illnesses. To determine the effectiveness of different interventions for symptom relief in COVID-19 patients, this study was conducted.

Trial Design: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID-19 patients. The researchers conducted a comprehensive search for relevant studies and included a variety of study designs, such as randomized controlled trials and retrospective cohort studies. The study population included individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, with no restrictions regarding age, gender, or comorbidities. The study timeframe extended until March 2021.

Results: After analyzing the available evidence, the researchers found very low certainty evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for symptom relief in COVID-19 patients. The identified studies were uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies, and the risk of bias was rated high. The researchers could not confidently support or refute the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions due to the limited evidence. Additionally, no data was found on the safety or efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for symptom control in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, no specific conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness or safety of interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID-19 patients. More evidence is needed to guide healthcare providers and caregivers in treating symptoms at the end of life in COVID-19 patients.

In conclusion, this comprehensive review highlights the need for further research to determine the most effective interventions for symptom relief in COVID-19 patients. Future studies should be prospectively registered, use an active-controlled setting, assess patient-reported outcomes, and clearly define interventions. As ongoing studies are published, updates to this review will provide more insights and potentially change the current conclusions about treatments for symptom control in COVID-19 patients.
