Plain Title: Medications for Self-Harm: What Does the Research Say?

Rationale: Self-harm, which includes intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, is a growing problem worldwide and is often linked to suicide. It is important to find effective treatments for self-harm, including medications. This study aimed to assess the effects of different medications and natural products in treating self-harm compared to other types of treatment. Understanding the effectiveness of medications can help healthcare professionals provide better care for individuals who engage in self-harm.

Trial Design: This study used a research method called a randomized controlled trial. It involved comparing different medications or natural products with either a placebo (an inactive substance) or an alternative medication. The study focused on adults aged 18 years or older who had engaged in self-harm and had sought medical help within the past six months. Participants were followed for a maximum of two years to see if they experienced another episode of self-harm. 

Results: The study included data from seven trials involving 574 participants. Most of the participants were female, with an average age of 35.3 years. The findings showed that there is uncertain evidence regarding the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants in reducing the occurrence of self-harm compared to a placebo. However, there may be a lower rate of self-harm repetition for antipsychotics compared to a placebo. There was no significant difference in self-harm repetition between antipsychotics and other comparator drugs. The study also found no evidence of a difference in self-harm repetition between mood stabilizers or natural products compared to a placebo. 

In conclusion, due to the limited number of trials and the low quality of the available evidence, it is uncertain whether medications are effective in treating individuals who engage in self-harm. More and larger trials are needed, particularly with newer medications. It is also important to evaluate the adverse effects of medications and to explore the combination of medication and psychological treatment. Further research will help improve our understanding and treatment of self-harm.
