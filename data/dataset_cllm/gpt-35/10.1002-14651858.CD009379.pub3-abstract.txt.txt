Plain Title: Comparing Amniotic Membrane Transplantation to Medical Therapy for Ocular Surface Burns

Rationale:
Ocular surface burns can happen from chemicals or direct heat, causing damage to the cells on the surface of the eye. This damage can lead to slow healing and problems with the cornea. Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) is a surgery that involves using a piece of amniotic membrane to cover the eye and help with healing. It is believed that AMT can reduce pain and speed up the healing process. However, there is still debate about which burns benefit from AMT and if it actually improves outcomes.

Trial Design:
This study compared the effects of AMT with medical therapy to medical therapy alone in the first seven days after an ocular surface burn. The study included people of different ages who had suffered an ocular surface burn. The study lasted for a certain amount of time depending on when the burn occurred and when the treatment started.

Results:
The main results of the study showed that for moderate burns, AMT may have some benefits. It reduced the failure of healing by day 21 and improved visual acuity. It also had a possible positive effect on corneal neovascularisation, symblepharon formation, and time-to-epithelialisation. However, the evidence for these benefits was uncertain due to some limitations in the study. 

For severe burns, the study did not find any significant benefits of using AMT. It did not improve healing, visual outcomes, or other measures. However, the evidence for this was also limited.

In conclusion, the evidence is not clear about the benefits of using AMT for ocular surface burns. It may provide some advantages for moderate burns, but more research is needed to confirm this. For severe burns, there doesn't seem to be a significant benefit from using AMT.
