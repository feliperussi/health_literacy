Plain Title: The Impact of Virtual Reality Training on Cataract Surgery Performance

Rationale: Cataract surgery is a common procedure in ophthalmology, and proper training is essential for ophthalmologists. However, the impact of virtual reality (VR) training on trainee performance is not well understood. This study aims to assess the effects of VR training on operating time, complications, and ratings from supervising physicians and VR simulators.

Trial Design: This study compared VR training with other methods of training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. Randomized controlled trials were conducted, with participants ranging from 12 to 60 trainees in each study. The study included trainees from different countries such as the US, China, Germany, India, and Morocco. The duration of the study varied among the trials.

Results: The evidence is uncertain regarding the benefits of VR training. However, trainees who received VR training had shorter operating times compared to those without supplementary training. When comparing VR training with wet laboratory training, the results were inconsistent. Some studies showed longer operating times with VR training, while others reported similar times between the two methods. VR-trained trainees had fewer intraoperative complications compared to those without supplementary training in some studies, but the results were varied. VR training had a similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory training and may have a greater impact compared to no supplementary training. However, the evidence for these secondary outcomes is uncertain. Trainees who received VR training had reduced operating time in simulated settings and higher VR simulator ratings. The ratings from supervising physicians varied depending on the setting and the type of training.

Conclusions: The current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The comparison between VR and conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of VR training on cataract surgery performance.
