Plain Title: Comparison of Implants for Hip Fracture Surgery in Older Adults

Rationale: Hip fractures are a major problem that affects many patients, healthcare systems, and society as a whole. As the population of older adults increases, the number of hip fractures is also rising. Most hip fractures require surgery, and this study aims to evaluate the different types of implants used in joint-preserving surgery for these fractures. The goal is to determine which implant is the most effective in treating hip fractures in older adults.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared different implants used for surgery in older adults with hip fractures. The implants studied were smooth pins, screws, or fixed angle plates. The study involved participants between the ages of 60 and 84, with 73% being women. The duration of the study varied across the different trials.

Results: The study included 38 studies with a total of 8,585 participants and 8,590 hip fractures. The main comparisons focused on different categories of implants. The evidence showed that there was little or no difference between smooth pins and fixed angle plates in terms of independent mobility, early mortality, mortality at 12 months, and unplanned return to the operating room. The evidence also suggested that there were no clinically important differences between screws and fixed angle plates in terms of functional status and health-related quality of life. Additionally, there was no significant difference in mortality at 12 months and unplanned return to the operating room between screws and smooth pins. However, the evidence for these findings was of low certainty. 

Overall, the study concluded that there may be little or no difference between the different types of implants in terms of functional status, health-related quality of life, mortality at 12 months, and unplanned return to the operating room. However, the evidence was of low certainty, and more research is needed to increase our confidence in these findings. Future studies should also focus on outcomes such as activities of daily living and mobility to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of different implants on hip fracture surgery.
