Plain Title: The Effects of Long-Term Therapy for Endometriosis on In Vitro Fertilization Outcomes

Rationale: Endometriosis can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant, leading to fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We wanted to see if long-term therapy with a medication called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist before IVF or ICSI could improve pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of long-term GnRH agonist therapy compared to no treatment or other treatment options.

Trial Design: We reviewed studies that involved women with endometriosis and compared the use of GnRH agonist therapy (minimum 3 months) before IVF/ICSI to no treatment or other treatments. We looked at factors like age, health condition, and gender of the participants. The study duration varied depending on the specific treatment.

Results: We included eight studies with a total of 640 participants. However, we found that the quality of the evidence was very low to low. It remains uncertain whether long-term GnRH agonist therapy affects the live birth rate, complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes, or mean number of embryos compared to standard IVF/ICSI. 

The available data is limited, and more high-quality trials are needed to determine the true impact of long-term GnRH agonist therapy on IVF/ICSI outcomes. We also need studies that compare GnRH agonist therapy to other treatment options for endometriosis. This information will help us make informed decisions about the best ways to manage endometriosis and improve fertility outcomes.
