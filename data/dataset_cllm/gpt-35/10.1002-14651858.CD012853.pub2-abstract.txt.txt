Plain Title: Cannabis and Crohn's Disease: Effects on Symptoms and Remission

Rationale:
Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to discomfort and reduced quality of life for patients. Researchers believe that the endocannabinoid system, which is targeted by cannabis and cannabinoids, might offer a potential treatment for this condition. However, studies have also shown that cannabis use may have side effects such as weakness, dizziness, and diarrhea, and it may increase the risk of surgery for individuals with Crohn's disease.

Study Design:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in inducing and maintaining remission in individuals with Crohn's disease. The researchers searched various databases, conference abstracts, and contacted experts in the field to gather relevant information.

Results:
The study analyzed three trials involving a total of 93 participants with active Crohn's disease who had previously undergone unsuccessful medical treatments. One study compared eight weeks of cannabis treatment (with THC) to a placebo in participants with active Crohn's disease. The results showed that 45% of the cannabis group achieved clinical remission, compared to only 10% of the placebo group. However, the certainty of this evidence was very low. Clinical response rates were also higher in the cannabis group.

Another study compared cannabis oil (with cannabidiol) to placebo oil in individuals with active Crohn's disease. The results did not show a significant difference in remission rates between the groups. Both groups experienced serious adverse events, with similar frequencies. One serious adverse event in each group required additional intervention.

A third study compared cannabis oil (with both cannabidiol and THC) to a placebo in individuals with active Crohn's disease. The results showed improvements in quality of life and Crohn's disease severity scores for the cannabis oil group compared to the placebo group.

Based on these findings, the effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No definitive conclusions can be drawn about their efficacy and safety in treating active Crohn's disease in adults. Furthermore, the effects of cannabis in individuals with quiescent Crohn's disease have not been studied. Larger studies with more participants are needed to better understand the potential benefits and risks of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future research should also investigate different doses and delivery methods of cannabis treatment in individuals with both active and quiescent Crohn's disease.
