Plain Title: Comparison of Drugs for Treating a Heart Condition in Premature Babies

Rationale: Premature babies are at risk of a heart condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which can have serious consequences. Currently, there is a debate about which type of medication, cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX-I), is the most effective and safest in treating PDA in premature infants. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of different COX-I drugs and no treatment in preterm infants.

Trial Design: The study will include preterm or low birth weight infants who are enrolled within 72 hours of birth and have not been diagnosed with PDA. They will be randomly assigned to receive prophylactic administration of indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, placebo, or no treatment. The study will last for a certain period of time.

Results: The study included 28 randomized controlled trials involving 3999 preterm infants. Prophylactic indomethacin showed a small reduction in severe intraventricular haemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) and moderate reduction in mortality and surgical closure of PDA compared to placebo. It had a trivial difference in NEC (a gastrointestinal condition), gastrointestinal perforation, or cerebral palsy, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic ibuprofen also showed a small reduction in severe intraventricular haemorrhage and moderate reduction in surgical closure of PDA compared to placebo. It may result in a moderate reduction in mortality and had trivial differences in chronic lung disease and NEC. The evidence for acetaminophen's effect on the outcomes was very uncertain.

In summary, both indomethacin and ibuprofen were equally effective in reducing severe intraventricular haemorrhage and mortality. Ibuprofen was more effective than indomethacin in reducing surgical closure of PDA. However, there were no significant differences observed between the COX-I drugs for any of the outcomes.

In conclusion, prophylactic indomethacin can potentially reduce the risk of severe intraventricular haemorrhage and mortality in preterm infants with PDA. It may have a small increase in chronic lung disease but has trivial differences in other outcomes. Prophylactic ibuprofen can also reduce the risk of severe intraventricular haemorrhage and surgical closure of PDA, with a possibly moderate reduction in mortality. The effect of acetaminophen on these outcomes is uncertain.
