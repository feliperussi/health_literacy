Plain Title: Arthroscopic Knee Surgery for Knee Osteoarthritis: Limited Benefits and Potential Harms

Rationale: Arthroscopic knee surgery is commonly used to treat knee osteoarthritis and degenerative meniscal tears, but current guidelines do not recommend its use. This study aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery or non-surgical treatments for people with degenerative knee disease. The study is needed to determine if arthroscopic surgery can effectively treat the condition.

Trial Design: The study included randomized controlled trials and trials with quasi-randomized allocation methods. Participants had symptomatic degenerative knee disease, including osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and more than half were women. The study assessed pain, function, treatment success, knee-specific quality of life, adverse events, and subsequent knee surgeries. The participants were followed for up to five years.

Results: The study found that arthroscopic surgery provides little to no difference in pain or function compared to placebo surgery. Knee-specific quality of life also showed minimal improvement after arthroscopic surgery. The evidence suggests that arthroscopic surgery may not improve treatment success compared to a placebo procedure. The study also suggested a possible increase in serious and total adverse events with arthroscopic surgery, although the certainty of this evidence is low. The risk of subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) after arthroscopy compared to control remains uncertain.

In conclusion, arthroscopic knee surgery for knee osteoarthritis has limited benefits with regards to pain, function, and quality of life. It may not improve treatment success significantly compared to placebo surgery. There may be a slight increase in serious and total adverse events associated with arthroscopic surgery. The need for subsequent knee surgery after arthroscopy is still unclear.
