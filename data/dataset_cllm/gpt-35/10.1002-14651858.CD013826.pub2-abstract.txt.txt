Plain Title: The Use of Mouth Rinses to Reduce Contamination in Dental Clinics

Rationale: Dental healthcare providers are at risk of catching diseases transmitted through droplets, aerosols, or contaminated surfaces in dental clinics. These diseases include tuberculosis, measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To reduce this risk, researchers are studying the use of preprocedural mouth rinses by patients before dental procedures. The hypothesis is that these mouth rinses can decrease the amount of bacteria in the aerosols generated during dental procedures, thus reducing the risk of infection for healthcare providers.

Trial Design: The study included dental patients undergoing procedures that generate aerosols, such as drilling. The researchers conducted a search of relevant studies up until February 4, 2022. They included randomized controlled trials and excluded laboratory-based studies. The outcomes measured included the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers, the level of contamination in the dental clinic environment, cost, changes in mouth bacteria, adverse events, and patient acceptance and feasibility of the mouth rinse intervention.

Results: The researchers analyzed 17 studies involving 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. None of the studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers, which was the primary outcome of interest. Instead, the studies focused on the reduction in bacterial contamination measured in colony-forming units (CFUs) at different distances. The evidence suggests that chlorhexidine (CHX) mouth rinse may reduce bacterial contamination compared to no rinsing or rinsing with water. Similar results were seen with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and other mouth rinse comparisons. However, the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. There is also limited and inconsistent evidence for other head-to-head comparisons.

The studies did not provide information on costs, changes in mouth micro-organisms, or adverse events related to the mouth rinses. They also did not assess patient acceptability or the feasibility of implementing mouth rinses in dental practices.

In conclusion, there is not enough evidence to determine if preprocedural mouth rinses can reduce the risk of infection in dental healthcare providers or if one rinse is superior to another. More studies are needed to evaluate the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk and contamination in larger distances within dental clinics using standardized measurements.
