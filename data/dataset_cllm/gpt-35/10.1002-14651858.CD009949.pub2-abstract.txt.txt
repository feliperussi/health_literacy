Plain Title: Elbow Joint Aspiration for Treating Elbow Fractures: Benefits and Risks

Rationale: Elbow fractures, specifically radial head fractures, are common injuries that can occur from falling onto an outstretched arm. Elbow joint aspiration, a technique to relieve pressure in the elbow joint, has been used as an initial treatment option. However, it is an invasive procedure that carries potential risks such as infection and nerve or vessel damage. This study aimed to assess the effects of elbow joint aspiration for treating radial head fractures in adults and determine if it is a beneficial and safe treatment option.

Trial Design: This study involved a search of various databases, including the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, to identify relevant research articles. The selection criteria included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared aspiration versus no aspiration for treating radial head fractures in adults. The data from the selected articles were independently assessed by two review authors. Comparable studies were analysed using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Two trials involving a total of 126 participants were included in the analysis.

Results: The quality of evidence for all outcomes was judged to be very low due to the high risk of bias in the included trials. Both trials had limitations in study design and reporting. The analysis showed little difference between aspiration and no aspiration in terms of impaired function and discomfort when carrying loads at 12 months. Aspiration had a beneficial effect on immediate pain relief, and there was less pain after aspiration at three weeks. However, it is unclear if this pain relief persists over time. The trials did not report on adverse events, except for one trial where aspiration was unsuccessful in three participants. The range of motion in the elbow was similar between the aspiration and no aspiration groups at six weeks and 12 months. Limited information was available regarding adverse events, but one trial reported the absence of specific complications related to the procedure.

Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of joint aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures in terms of function, pain, and range of motion. The safety of the procedure is also uncertain. Further research is needed, including the examination of current aspiration use, collection of adverse events, and consultation with patients, to guide the design of future randomized trials that can provide definitive evidence on the use of aspiration for treating radial head fractures.
