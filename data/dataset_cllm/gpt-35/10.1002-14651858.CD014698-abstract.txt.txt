Plain Title: Ultrasound During Pregnancy for Early Diagnosis and Monitoring

Rationale: Ultrasound during pregnancy before 24 weeks can provide more accurate dating and diagnose potential problems in the unborn baby. However, it can also give false reassurance. This study aims to compare the effects of routine ultrasound exams with selective or no exams before 24 weeks gestation. The goal is to determine if routine ultrasound can improve the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, fetal congenital abnormalities, multiple pregnancies, and maternal and fetal outcomes.

Trial Design: This study included a review of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 85,265 women. It compared the outcomes of routine ultrasound exams before 24 weeks with selective or no exams. The trials included pregnant women from various countries and were assessed for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. The review evaluated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Results: 
- First trimester routine ultrasound: Based on four studies involving 1,791 women, first trimester ultrasound exams probably reduce short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy. The evidence is uncertain regarding the effect on perinatal loss or induction of labor for post-maturity.
- Second trimester routine ultrasound: Based on seven studies involving 36,053 women, second trimester ultrasound exams probably have little effect on perinatal loss or intrauterine fetal death. They may reduce the induction of labor for post-maturity and improve the detection of multiple pregnancy and major fetal abnormalities. Long-term follow-up of children exposed to these scans did not show harm to their physical or intellectual development. The effect on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported.
- Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications: One study involving 47,431 women compared standard pregnancy care with additional ultrasounds and referral for complications. The results showed little difference in giving birth in a risk-appropriate setting or low birthweight. The effect on maternal mortality was uncertain.
- Revealed ultrasound results versus concealed ultrasound results: One study involving 1,095 women found uncertain evidence for the differences between revealed and concealed ultrasound results.

Overall, early ultrasound exams reduce short-term maternal anxiety, while later exams may reduce labor induction for post-maturity and improve the detection of major fetal abnormalities. They may also reduce undetected twin pregnancies. However, neither type of scan appears to significantly impact other important maternal or fetal outcomes. It's important to note that these trials were conducted early in the development of ultrasound technology and may not fully represent the effects in modern practice.
