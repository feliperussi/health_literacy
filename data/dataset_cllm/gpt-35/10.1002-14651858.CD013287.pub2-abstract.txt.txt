Plain Title: Comparing Different Treatment Approaches for Recent-Onset Psychosis

Rationale: Psychosis is an illness characterized by hallucinations and delusions that can greatly affect a person's behavior and overall well-being. A first episode of psychosis (FEP) refers to the first time someone experiences these symptoms, which typically occur in late adolescence or early adulthood. Recent-onset psychosis is a term used to describe the early stages of psychosis. Specialized early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that focus on treating individuals with recent-onset psychosis. These teams provide a range of treatments, including medication, therapy, education, and support. The duration of SEI treatment is typically two to three years, but it is uncertain whether the benefits are sustained after treatment ends. Extending SEI treatment has been proposed as a way to maintain the positive outcomes and improve long-term outcomes for individuals with psychosis.

Trial Design: This study aimed to compare two different approaches for treating individuals with recent-onset psychosis. The first approach compared extended SEI teams with standard treatment as usual (TAU). The second approach compared extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU. The study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and involved a total of 780 participants aged 16 to 35 years who met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. The duration of the study varied among the trials.

Results: The evidence from the study was of low or very low certainty. One of the main findings was that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health services compared to standard SEI teams followed by TAU. Additionally, there was some preliminary evidence suggesting a potential increase in remission rates with extended SEI, although the certainty of this evidence was very low. The study did not find significant differences in rates of psychiatric hospital admission or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital between the two approaches. Furthermore, there was uncertain evidence regarding the effects of extended SEI on global functioning and mortality rates. Overall, the certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low.

In conclusion, there may be some benefit in extending SEI team care for individuals with recent-onset psychosis, particularly in terms of reducing disengagement from mental health services. However, the evidence is still uncertain, and further studies are needed to provide more conclusive results. It is important to conduct larger studies with consistent outcome selection to fully understand the effectiveness of extended SEI treatment. Therefore, it may take a few years before a definitive conclusion can be reached regarding the effectiveness of extended SEI treatment for recent-onset psychosis.
