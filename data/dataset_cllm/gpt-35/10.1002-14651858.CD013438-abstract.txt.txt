Plain Title: Effectiveness of Beta-Blockers for Adults Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery

Rationale: Beta-blockers are medications that may be used before, during, or after surgery to prevent complications and improve outcomes. However, previous studies have provided conflicting results about the effectiveness of beta-blockers in reducing surgery-related problems. This review focuses specifically on non-cardiac surgery to determine whether beta-blockers can prevent complications and improve safety for patients. It is important to understand if beta-blockers are beneficial in order to guide medical decisions and improve patient care.

Trial Design: The study reviewed randomized controlled trials involving adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Researchers compared the use of beta-blockers to a control group (placebo or standard care) to assess their effectiveness. The review included a total of 83 trials with 14,967 participants. The types of surgeries ranged from low to high-risk, and various types of beta-blockers were used. The duration of beta-blocker administration varied across studies. The researchers assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence using established methods.

Results: The evidence regarding the impact of beta-blockers on all-cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain. However, beta-blockers may reduce the incidence of heart attacks and atrial fibrillation/flutter. On the other hand, beta-blockers may increase the risk of bradycardia (low heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure). There was no evidence to suggest a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias.

Based on the available evidence, the researchers conclude that the effectiveness of beta-blockers in preventing complications and improving outcomes in non-cardiac surgery is uncertain. Further large-scale trials are needed to provide more conclusive evidence and to assess the impact of beta-blockers on the quality of life for patients.

In summary, this review evaluates the use of beta-blockers in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. While there is limited evidence that beta-blockers may reduce heart attacks and atrial fibrillation/flutter, they may also increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension. More research is needed to determine the true benefits and potential risks of using beta-blockers in this context.
