Plain Title: Effectiveness of NSAIDs for Acute Low Back Pain

Rationale: Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common problem that can cause significant discomfort and disability. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat LBP. A previous review showed that NSAIDs had a small but significant effect in reducing pain and improving symptoms in people with acute LBP. This updated review aims to assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other treatments for acute LBP.

Trial Design: This study analyzed data from 32 randomized controlled trials involving 5,356 participants with acute LBP. The trials were conducted in different parts of the world and included both primary and secondary care settings. The participants ranged in age from 16 to 78 years. The follow-up period ranged from one day to six months. The effects of NSAIDs on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work were evaluated.

Results: The study found that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity and improving disability in the short term. However, the magnitude of these effects is small and may not be clinically significant. There is also some evidence that NSAIDs may improve global improvement in the short term, but the results varied between studies. The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events or being able to return to work did not show clear differences between NSAIDs and placebo. The comparison between selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs did not reveal significant differences in pain reduction, disability improvement, global improvement, or adverse events.

The conclusions from the investigators indicate that NSAIDs have a small effect in reducing pain and improving symptoms in people with acute LBP. However, the clinical relevance of these effects is questionable. It is important to note that the quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, suggesting that further research is needed for more definitive conclusions. Additionally, the study did not provide sufficient evidence on the long-term safety of NSAIDs for LBP, as it mainly focused on short-term use.
