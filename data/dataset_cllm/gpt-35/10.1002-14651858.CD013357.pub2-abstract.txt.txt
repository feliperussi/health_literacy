Plain Title: The Effects of Silicone Gel Sheeting for Hypertrophic Scars: A Review

Rationale: 
Scars can cause problems like itching, pain, and changes in appearance. They can affect a person's quality of life and well-being. Hypertrophic scars are raised scars that stay in one place and may go away on their own. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is a common treatment for hypertrophic scars. We want to know how well SGS works for treating these scars.

Trial Design:
We looked at different studies that tested SGS for hypertrophic scars. We included studies that used SGS on people with these scars. We searched medical databases and other sources for these studies. We also considered studies that were not published in English. 

Results:
We found 13 studies that met our criteria. The studies included between 10 and 60 participants. The studies were not all the same - they differed in how long they lasted and where the scars were located. We compared SGS with no treatment and with other treatments like pressure garments, silicone gel, and topical onion extract. Some studies had a split-site design, meaning the treatment was used on one part of the scar and not the other. Other studies were not clear on their design. 

The studies had limited information about how severe the scars were according to health professionals and patients. We found some evidence that SGS may reduce pain compared to no treatment. However, the evidence was limited and of low certainty. We also found some evidence that SGS may be better than pressure garments for reducing pain, but more research is needed. SGS did not show clear benefits compared to silicone gel or topical onion extract. 

Overall, the studies we looked at were not very reliable. They did not provide enough information to make definite conclusions about the effectiveness of SGS for hypertrophic scars. We need more research to better understand how SGS can be used to treat these types of scars. 

In summary, more research is needed to determine if silicone gel sheeting is an effective treatment for hypertrophic scars.
