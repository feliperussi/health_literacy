1. Plain Title: Acupuncture for Migraine Prevention: New Evidence and Treatment Options 
2. Rationale: Migraines can be a burden for patients, causing frequent headaches that greatly impact their daily lives. Acupuncture has been used as a preventative treatment for migraines, but its effectiveness is still debated. This study aimed to investigate whether acupuncture is more effective than no treatment or routine care, compared to sham (placebo) acupuncture, and as effective as medication in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic migraines. 
3. Trial Design: The study included randomized trials that compared acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or medication for at least eight weeks. The participants were adults with episodic migraines. The study expected participants to be involved for a certain period of time. 
4. Results: The study found that acupuncture was effective in reducing headache frequency compared to no treatment. Acupuncture also had a small but statistically significant effect compared to sham acupuncture. Additionally, acupuncture was found to be as effective as medication in reducing migraine frequency. The study concluded that acupuncture can be considered as a treatment option for patients who are willing to try it. However, more long-term studies are needed to fully understand the effectiveness of acupuncture for migraines.
