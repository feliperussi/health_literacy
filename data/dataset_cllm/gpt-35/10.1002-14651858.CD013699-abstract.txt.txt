Plain Title: Effectiveness of Digital Tools for Contact Tracing during Infectious Disease Outbreaks

Rationale: 
Contact tracing is a way to identify people who have been in contact with someone who has an infectious disease, like COVID-19. It helps to isolate those people and prevent the spread of the disease. Digital technology can help make contact tracing faster and more effective. Digital tools for contact tracing can be used in different ways, such as responding to outbreaks, tracing people who have been close to an infected individual, or tracking symptoms. In this study, we looked at how effective digital solutions are for contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks, like COVID-19.

Trial Design: 
We searched for studies that tested different digital solutions for contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. These studies included different types of research, like randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and modeling studies. We looked at studies that focused on general populations and included different types of contact tracing, both during outbreaks and outside of outbreaks. The digital solutions in the studies included software that could be installed on devices or provided by the government or other organizations. We compared these digital solutions to traditional contact tracing methods, like interviews and medical records. We also looked at things like the time it took to complete contact tracing and any issues related to privacy and safety.

Results: 
We found that there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of digital solutions for contact tracing during real-world outbreaks. Modeling studies showed some evidence that digital contact tracing, along with other public health measures, could reduce the number of secondary cases. However, the certainty of this evidence was low because of uncertainties in the models used and assumptions made. Cohort studies showed very low-certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may help in getting more accurate counts of contacts and reducing the time needed to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions were generally preferred by contact tracing teams and were found to be faster and more accurate in managing large amounts of data. However, there were concerns about the equity of access to digital solutions, especially for at-risk populations with limited internet access or availability of digital technology. It is important to conduct more research to understand the effectiveness and acceptability of contact tracing technologies, including how digital solutions can work together with manual systems. Future studies should also consider privacy concerns and the impact of digital solutions on equity.

In conclusion, while there is some evidence that digital tools can be helpful for contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks, more research is needed to fully understand their effectiveness. It is also important to consider access to and acceptability of these tools, as well as their impact on equity. Further research is needed to determine the best ways to use digital solutions alongside traditional contact tracing methods.
