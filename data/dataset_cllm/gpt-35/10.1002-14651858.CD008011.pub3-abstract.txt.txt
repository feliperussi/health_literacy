Plain Title: Medical Treatments for Heart Problems in Childhood Cancer Patients

Rationale: 
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat childhood cancer can cause heart problems both during and after treatment. We don't know if the treatments that help adults with heart problems can also help children with cancer-related heart problems. This study aims to compare different medical treatments for heart problems caused by chemotherapy in childhood cancer patients.

Trial Design: 
This study is designed to test different medical treatments for heart problems in childhood cancer patients. The study will include both boys and girls of different ages who have been treated for cancer. Patients will be in the study for a certain amount of time.

Results: 
The main results of the study showed that one medication called enalapril improved heart function in childhood cancer survivors with heart problems. However, it is still unclear if this medication actually improves overall health. It is important for doctors to consider the possible benefits as well as the side effects, such as dizziness and fatigue, before prescribing enalapril to childhood cancer survivors with heart problems.

Another medication called phosphocreatine did not show any significant differences compared to the control treatment for heart problems in childhood cancer patients. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of phosphocreatine on heart function and overall health.

It is important to note that there were no other studies investigating different medical treatments for heart problems in childhood cancer patients. More high-quality studies should be done in the future to find better ways to treat these heart problems.
