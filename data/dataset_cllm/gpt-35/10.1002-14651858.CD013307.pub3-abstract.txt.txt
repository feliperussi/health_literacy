Plain Title: Non-Drug Approaches to Prevent Delirium in Hospitalized Patients

Rationale: Delirium is a temporary brain disorder that can occur in patients while they are in the hospital. It can be very distressing and is associated with serious risks. Current treatments for delirium are limited, so it is important to focus on preventing it from happening in the first place. Non-drug interventions are believed to be effective in preventing delirium.

Trial Design: This study looked at different non-drug approaches to prevent delirium in hospitalized patients who were not in intensive care units. A total of 22 studies involving over 5,000 adult participants were included in the analysis. These studies investigated various interventions such as re-orientation, cognitive stimulation, sleep hygiene, attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood, bowel and bladder care, reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilization, pain control, and blood transfusion thresholds. The study used a review process to examine the data and assess the effectiveness of these interventions. The duration of the study varied depending on the specific intervention being tested.

Results: The analysis showed that non-drug interventions, especially those involving multiple components, can reduce the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients compared to usual care. The risk of delirium was reduced by 43% in those who received non-drug interventions. However, there was no evidence to suggest that these interventions had an effect on mortality. The length of hospital stay may be reduced with these interventions, and there was some evidence that they could also shorten the duration of delirium episodes. However, the severity of delirium remains uncertain. Some specific interventions were associated with a reduced risk of delirium, such as re-orientation, cognitive stimulation, and sleep hygiene. Others, like reducing sensory deprivation, identifying infection, mobilization, and pain control, had uncertain effects. There was no evidence to support the effectiveness of certain other interventions.

In conclusion, non-drug interventions are effective in preventing delirium in hospitalized adults. These interventions can reduce the risk of delirium by 43% compared to usual care. They may also help shorten hospital stays and the duration of delirium episodes. However, more research is needed to better understand how these interventions work and to provide more specific recommendations for healthcare providers.
