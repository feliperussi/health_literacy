Plain Title: Effects of Screening and House Modifications on Malaria

Rationale: Malaria is a preventable disease that still poses a significant health problem. Progress in malaria control has slowed down in recent years, prompting researchers and policymakers to explore new ways to combat the disease. One potential approach is modifying houses to reduce exposure to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Previous research has shown that altering house construction materials or blocking mosquito entry points can be effective in reducing malaria transmission. This study aims to assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.

Trial Design: The study design involves randomized controlled trials conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The trials include various methods such as screening windows, doors, eaves, and ceilings, either alone or in combination with other modifications. Some interventions are insecticide-based. The trials assess the impact of these modifications on malaria incidence and parasite prevalence. The study population consists of individuals living in these modified houses. The expected duration of participation in the study varies depending on the trial.

Results: Based on the two published trials, screening houses without insecticide has shown promise in reducing clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria parasite prevalence was also lower in the intervention group, along with a positive effect on anemia. The entomological inoculation rate, which measures mosquito bites, was reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group. Additionally, individuals living in fully screened houses were less likely to sleep under a bed net, indicating a potential reduction in mosquito exposure. However, further trials that are yet to be published will provide more evidence on the effectiveness of these house modifications in reducing malaria transmission and infection.

Overall, this study suggests that screening and house modifications may have a positive impact on reducing malaria transmission and infection among individuals living in modified houses. As more trials are conducted and published, we will continue to update our knowledge on the effectiveness of these interventions.
