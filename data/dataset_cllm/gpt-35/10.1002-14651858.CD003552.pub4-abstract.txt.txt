Plain Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Contraceptive Patches and Rings Compared to Birth Control Pills

Rationale: 
Birth control pills are commonly used, but there are alternative methods like contraceptive patches and rings that could offer benefits such as lower doses and improved adherence. This study aims to compare the effectiveness, cycle control, adherence, and safety of contraceptive patches and rings to birth control pills in preventing pregnancy.

Trial Design:
The study involved analyzing data from 18 randomized controlled trials. These trials compared the use of contraceptive patches or rings with birth control pills. Participants included both males and females of various ages and health conditions. The study lasted for a different duration in each trial.

Results:
The study found that the effectiveness of contraceptive patches and rings was similar to birth control pills in preventing pregnancy. However, there were differences in adherence and side effects. Patch users showed better adherence compared to birth control pill users in three trials. The patch group also had more discontinuations and reported more side effects like breast discomfort, dysmenorrhea, nausea, and vomiting. On the other hand, ring users had fewer discontinuations and reported fewer side effects like nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional lability. In terms of cycle control, the patch group had better control of breakthrough bleeding and spotting, while the ring group generally had better cycle control compared to birth control pill users.

Based on the available evidence, there was no significant difference in effectiveness between contraceptive patches, rings, and birth control pills. However, the patch group had better adherence but more discontinuations and side effects compared to the birth control pill users. The ring group had fewer adverse events but more vaginal irritation and discharge than birth control pill users. The quality of evidence for this review was considered low for patches and moderate for rings, mainly due to limitations in the study methods and data collection.

In conclusion, this study suggests that contraceptive patches and rings can be effective alternatives to birth control pills. However, it is important to consider individual preferences, adherence, and potential side effects when choosing a contraceptive method. Consulting with healthcare professionals can help determine the most suitable option based on an individual's needs and health condition.
