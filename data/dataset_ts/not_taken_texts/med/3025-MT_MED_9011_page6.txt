Clinical Study Results
To answer this question, the researchers calculated the amount of time that the
participants lived with their PRCC without their tumors growing. This is called
progression-free survival, also called PFS.
The doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors at different times throughout
the study. They did this using CT or MRI scans to measure how long it took for
tumors to grow a certain amount. This allowed the researchers to learn how each
study treatment affected the size of the tumors during the study. To calculate the
PFS, the researchers counted the number of months that the participants in each
treatment group lived without their tumors growing. The researchers looked at
these results using a median. A median is a kind of average. It is between the
lowest and highest numbers.
They compared the results in the participants who took savolitinib and those who
took sunitinib. The researchers found that the differences between the 2 treatment
groups were too small to know if savolitinib slowed tumor growth compared to
sunitinib.
The researchers found that the median PFS for each group was:
• 7.0 months in the participants who took savolitinib
• 5.6 months in the participants who took sunitinib
The chart below shows these results.
