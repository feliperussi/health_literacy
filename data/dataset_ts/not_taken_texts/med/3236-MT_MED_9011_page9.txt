What medical problems happened during
this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are also called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for MEDI6570.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Because each of the different dose groups of MEDI6570 had a very small number
of participants, the results for each group have been combined into Part A and
Part B. Showing the information this way helps protect the participants’ identities.
Overall, the researchers found that the results for each dose of MEDI6570 were
similar.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?

was 8 out of 88 participants.
X 5.6% of the participants who received MEDI6570 in Part A had adverse
reactions. This was 2 out of 36 participants.
X 16.7% of the participants who received the placebo in Part A had adverse
reactions. This was 2 out of 12 participants.
X 6.7% of the participants who received MEDI6570 in Part B had adverse
reactions. This was 2 out of 30 participants.
