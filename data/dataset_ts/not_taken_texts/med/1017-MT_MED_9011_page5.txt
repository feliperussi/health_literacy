What happened during this study?
The participants were in the study for up to about 3 years, but the entire study
took about 3.5 years to finish. The study started in February 2017 and ended in
June 2020.
The researchers had planned for the study to last almost 4 years. But, they ended
the study early because they had already found that dapagliflozin helped prevent
the participantsâ€™ CKD from getting worse compared to the placebo.
