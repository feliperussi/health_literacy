What happened during this study?
The study started in June 2017 and ended in March 2021.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 hours. At this visit, the study doctors
made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood and urine samples
X checked the participants’ heart health with an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
X scanned and measured the size of the participants’ tumors
X did a procedure called a biopsy to take samples of the participants’ tumors
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site at
least 7 times. This part of the study lasted for 12 weeks.
After 12 weeks of receiving study treatment, the participants each
continued in the study for a different period of time. Participants were given
MEDI0457 every 8 weeks and durvalumab every 4 weeks. This continued until
the participants chose to leave the study, their tumors got worse, or they had too
many side effects from the study treatments.
