Clinical Study Results
These measurements were not done for Groups 3 and 4, since the participants in these
groups did not get anifrolumab.

What was the amount of anifrolumab in the participants’ blood before the
dose at week 12?
The researchers wanted to know how much anifrolumab stayed in the participants’ blood
after getting several doses. To answer this question, the researchers took blood samples
from the participants just before they received their dose of anifrolumab at week 12 of the
study. They measured the amount of anifrolumab in the blood in Groups 1 and 2. This
was measured in micrograms per milliliter, also called µg/mL.
The researchers looked at these measurements using the median.
They found that at week 12, the median amount of anifrolumab was higher in the
participants who had been getting 300 mg of anifrolumab than in the participants who had
been getting 150 mg of anfrolumab.
The median amount of anifrolumab in the participants’ blood before getting the dose at
week 12 was:
• 14.6 µg/mL in Group 1
• 72.9 µg/mL in Group 2
