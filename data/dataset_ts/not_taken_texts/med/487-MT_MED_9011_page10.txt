CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155
The results of this study showed that people who were treated with inebilizumab
infusions had a significant reduction in the risk of having an NMOSD-related attack,
were less likely to have worsening of their disability, and had a reduced number
of new MRI lesions and NMOSD-related hospitalizations compared with placebo
treatment. There was no difference between inebilizumab and placebo in
improving the participant’s vision, or their overall quality of life. Inebilizumab
infusions were found to be safe and generally well-tolerated.
HOW HAS THIS STUDY HELPED
PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCHERS?
This study has provided evidence of the clinical benefit of inebilizumab infusions for the treatment of
NMOSD. It is important to note that this summary shows the overall results from one clinical study.
It does not show the results for individual people. Other studies of treatments for NMOSD may
produce different results.
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers look at the results of many studies
to decide which treatments work best and can be used safely.
You should not change your treatment based on the results of this study without talking
to a doctor first.
FURTHER STUDIES
At the end of the study, participants were invited to join a second part, which is known as an
‘open-label’ phase. Open-label means all participants receive inebilizumab infusions and no one is
treated with placebo. The aim of the open-label phase is to look at the effects of inebilizumab infusions
over a longer period.
At the time of writing this summary, the open-label phase was still ongoing. It is intended that the results
will be made available within 12 months of the study finishing.
