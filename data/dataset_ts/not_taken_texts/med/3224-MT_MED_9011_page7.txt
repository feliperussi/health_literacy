Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did BGF MDI and GFF MDI affect the participants’ lung airways?
Yes. Compared to the start of the study, the participants had more airway volume in
their lungs after taking BGF MDI and also after taking GFF MDI. They also had less
airway resistance after taking the 2 treatments. When there is more airway volume
and less airway resistance in the lungs, breathing becomes easier.
To answer this question, the researchers used a new type of measurement
called “functional respiratory imaging”, also called FRI. The researchers did these
measurements after the study staff took very detailed pictures of the lungs. They
took the pictures using a scan called “high-resolution computed tomography”, also
called HRCT.
These scans help researchers look at the inside of the airways and the lungs. The
researchers calculated 2 FRI measurements:
• airway volume
• airway resistance
The researchers looked at the FRI measurements before the participants took
either study treatment and compared them to the measurements after the
participants took the last dose of each study treatment. They calculated the
difference in the results before and after the participants took each treatment as a
percentage change.
