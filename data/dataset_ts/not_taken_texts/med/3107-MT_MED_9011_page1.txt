Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug studied: Pain relief patch
Study title: A study to learn if a pain relief patch reduces injection site pain
in healthy volunteers as well as an approved patch
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for a pain relief patch.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of
the study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in October 2017 and ended in November 2017. The study included
32 participants in Germany.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report
of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to reduce pain in people when they get an
injection. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
The researchers in this study wanted to learn more about a pain relief patch that may
reduce the pain that people feel when they get an injection. Doctors sometimes use
pain relief patches to numb part of a patientâ€™s body. This can help reduce the pain from
the injection.
