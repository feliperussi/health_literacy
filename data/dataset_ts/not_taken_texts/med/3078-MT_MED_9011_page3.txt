Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
In this study, the participants got either AZD9496 or fulvestrant. The doses were
measured in milligrams, also called mg.
The participants got either:
• 250 mg of AZD9496 twice daily
• a single dose of 500 mg of fulvestrant
A computer programme was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took AZD9496 as tablets by mouth. They got fulvestrant through a
needle into a muscle. This is also called an intramuscular injection.
All of the participants in this study were scheduled to have breast cancer surgery.
The study doctors also took a sample of their tumour tissue either the day before
the surgery, or at the start of the surgery. This is also called a tumour biopsy.
The participants started getting AZD9496 or fulvestrant several days before the
biopsy. They either:
• took 2 doses of AZD9496 at home every day for 5 to 14 days before the
biopsy
• got a single injection of fulvestrant at the study site 5 to 14 days before the
biopsy
This summary includes results for 46 participants. The AZD9496 treatment
group included 22 participants and the fulvestrant treatment group included 24
participants. There were 3 participants who joined the study but never took any
study treatment.
