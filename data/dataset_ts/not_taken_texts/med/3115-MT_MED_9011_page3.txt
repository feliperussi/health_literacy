Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did dapagliflozin affect the amount of glucose that left the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if dapagliflozin helps improve the health of people with T2DM.
What treatments did the participants take?
This study was divided into 2 parts. It was planned that all of the participants would take
dapagliflozin in one part of the study and a placebo in the other part of the study. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Each part lasted for 5 weeks. After completing Part 1, the participants waited 6 to 8 weeks before
taking the study treatment in Part 2.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order of treatments each participant took.
This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the
results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors,
or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking.
The participants took dapagliflozin and the placebo once a day as a tablet by mouth. The dose of
dapagliflozin was 10 milligrams, also known as mg.
There was 1 participant who left the study after taking dapagliflozin in Part 1. So, this participant
is not included in the group who took the placebo in Part 2.
