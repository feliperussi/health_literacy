Clinical Trial Results
When the study ended, the sponsor found out which treatment each participant
took. This allowed the sponsor to compare the results from participants in the
different treatment groups.
What happened during the study?
To see if participants could join the study, doctors asked about the
medications they were taking and their medical history. Study doctors also did a
physical examination to check the overall health of participants and asked how they
were feeling.
During the study, there were 3 treatments and three 14-day treatment periods.
All participants took all 3 treatments. During each of the 3 treatment periods,
participants took 1 of the 3 treatments below once daily through an inhaler for
14 days:
• 100 micrograms, also known as μg, of AZD8871
• 600 μg of AZD8871
• the placebo
The participants visited their study site up to 12 times during this study.
Between taking each treatment, there was a “wash-out period” that lasted
about 4 to 5 weeks. Participants were not allowed to take certain medications
during this time. This was done so that all medications and the treatments they took
before the next treatment would be “washed out” of their bodies.
At the end of the study, the participants went back to their study site for another
visit. Study doctors did a physical examination to check the overall health of
participants again.
