for patients with psoriasis
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drug AZD0284. This drug is being developed
to treat patients with psoriasis. The study started in December 2016 and ended in May 2017.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of
your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat a skin disease called psoriasis. Psoriasis
causes dry and itchy patches of skin on the body. AZD0284 is being developed to treat
this disease.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is. This information is important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if AZD0284 helps treat psoriasis.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during the study.
