This study was a “crossover” study. The participants in the study took the same
treatments, but in a different order.
Of the 39 participants, 4 did not take any treatment. So, the chart below includes
information for 35 participants.
There were 2 groups of participants:
• Group 1 had 17 participants. This group took Treatment 1, then Treatment 2,
and then Treatment 3.
• Group 2 had 18 participants. This group took Treatment 2, then Treatment 3,
and then Treatment 2 again.
This was done so that the researchers could compare the results when the
participants took acalabrutinib in different ways and with and without rabeprazole.
