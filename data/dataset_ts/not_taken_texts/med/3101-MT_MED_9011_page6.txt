Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
Usually the results from several trials are needed to decide if a treatment causes an
adverse reaction. At the time of this study, it was not known if these adverse reactions
were or were not caused by the study treatment.
