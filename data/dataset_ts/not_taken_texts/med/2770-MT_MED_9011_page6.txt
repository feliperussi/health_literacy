What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know if a drug causes a medical problem. So when researchers
study new drugs, they keep track of all the medical problems that participants have during
the study. These problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
During this study, 29 participants (24.4%) had at least one medical problem. Some
participants had medical problems with both doses they took.
Three participants were removed from the study because of medical problems that the
researchers believed were not serious.
