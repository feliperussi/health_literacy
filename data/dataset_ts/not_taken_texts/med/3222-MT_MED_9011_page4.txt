Was there a difference in how the two forms of selumetinib were taken up
by the body?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the levels of selumetinib in the blood
of participants who took the granule and capsule forms of selumetinib.
Overall, the absorption of selumetinib into the body was faster for both the capsule
and the granule form when participants had not eaten before taking the study drug,
compared with when participants had eaten before taking the drug. In the same amount
of time, 34.6% less of the granule form of selumetinib was taken up by the body
compared with the capsule form.
In Part 1 of the study, when participants had not eaten and took selumetinib, a slower
absorption of the granule was observed compared with the capsule.
• The body took 34 minutes longer to absorb the granule form of selumetinib compared
with the capsule form.
In Part 2 of the study, when participants had eaten a meal before taking selumetinib,
both forms of the drug were shown to be absorbed more slowly by the body compared
with not having eaten beforehand.
• The body took 54 minutes longer to absorb the capsule form of selumetinib and 78
minutes longer to absorb the granule form compared with not having eaten before.
