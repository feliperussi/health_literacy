Clinical Trial Results
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this
study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide
which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD7594
are planned.
The results below are for 16 out of the original 18 participants. This is because 2 participants
left the study before it was completed.
How did AZD7594 act in the body when participants took it in different particle sizes?
Researchers wanted to know how AZD7594 acts in the body when given in different particle
sizes. They wanted to know:
• The total amount of AZD7594 in the blood
• The highest amount of AZD7594 in the blood
• How long it took for AZD7594 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Total amount of AZD7594 in the blood
Researchers measured the total amount of AZD7594 in participants’ blood in picomole
hours per liter of blood (h•pmol/L).
The figure below shows this amount for the 3 AZD7594 treatments.
