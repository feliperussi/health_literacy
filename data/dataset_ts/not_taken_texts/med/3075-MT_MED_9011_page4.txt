Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
individual participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the website listed at the end
of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on

How did the 3-drug treatment and the 2-drug treatment act in the body?
The researchers wanted to find out how the 3-drug treatment and the 2-drug treatment
acted in the body.
The researchers took blood samples from the participants at different times during
the study. Then, the researchers measured:
• the average amount of the study drugs in the blood
• the highest amount of the study drugs in the blood
• how long it took for the study drugs to reach their highest amount in the blood
In general, the researchers found that after 7 days of treatment:
Budesonide
• The participants who took the higher dose of the 3-drug treatment had higher
average and overall amounts of budesonide in their blood compared to the
participants who took the lower dose of the 3-drug treatment.
• It took the same amount of time for budesonide to reach its highest amount in the
blood for the participants in both of the 3-drug treatment groups.
Glycopyrronium
• The average and overall amounts of glycopyrronium in the blood were similar among
all 3 treatment groups.
• It took the same amount of time for glycopyrronium to reach its highest amount in
the blood among all 3 treatment groups.
Formoterol fumarate
• The average and overall amounts of formoterol fumarate in the blood were similar
among all 3 treatment groups.
• It took the same amount of time for formoterol fumarate to reach its highest amount
in the blood among all 3 treatment groups.
