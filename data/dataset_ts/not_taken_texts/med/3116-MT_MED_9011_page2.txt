Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got tezepelumab or a placebo in addition to their
usual asthma treatment. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any
medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did tezepelumab affect the number of asthma attacks over 1 year?
Yes. Overall, the participants who got tezepelumab had fewer asthma attacks
during 1 year compared to the participants who got the placebo.
> Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped their quality of life
or helped them control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the participants who got tezepelumab felt that study treatment
helped their quality of life and their asthma more than those who got the
placebo.
> What medical problems happened during the study?
There were 8.4% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to either study drug during the study. This
was 89 out of 1,059 participants.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
