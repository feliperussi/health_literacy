Clinical Study Results
The researchers found that:
• 6.1% of participants had their tumors shrink or disappear in the durvalumab-only
treatment group. This was 2 out of 33 participants. However, researchers could not
tell if these changes were related to the durvalumab treatment.
• 3.1% of participants had their tumors shrink or disappear in the durvalumab and
tremelimumab treatment group. This was 1 out of 32 participants. The researchers
thought that this change was related to the treatment.
The figure below shows these results.

the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems participants had during the study that

life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
