The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities the
participants had during the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is a medical problem that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participantâ€™s dose of
study treatment. A dose-limiting toxicity is also known as a DLT.
Counting the number of DLTs helps researchers determine the safety of different
doses of a treatment. This helps them find the highest dose that the participants
can take.
The study doctors were not able to measure DLTs for 7 of the participants. So, the
DLT information collected was for 51 participants.
In this study, 9.8% of the participants had a DLT. This was 5 out of 51 participants.
