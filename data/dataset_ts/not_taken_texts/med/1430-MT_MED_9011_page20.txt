Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer, also called ES-SCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to
get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Sometimes researchers do a study of a drug in a small number of participants to
decide if they should do a similar study in a larger number of participants.
This small study had 3 groups of participants. Each group got a different
treatment. This summary shows the results for Group 3. The results for Groups 1
and 2 are in different summaries.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in Group 3 of this study took ceralasertib with olaparib.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for Group 3 in this study
were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participantsâ€™ tumors?
Some participants in Group 3 had tumors that shrank after they took
ceralasertib with olaparib. But, the overall number of participants whose
tumors shrank was small.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 76.2% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
The most common medical problem was a low number of red blood cells.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
