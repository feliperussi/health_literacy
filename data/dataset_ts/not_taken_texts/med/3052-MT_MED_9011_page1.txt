Why was the research needed?
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
The researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
The body does not use insulin normally in people with type 2 diabetes. Insulin is a
substance produced by the body that controls glucose levels, also known as sugar
levels, in the blood. The insulin in people with type 2 diabetes is not able to control
blood sugar levels in the body. This can cause blood sugar levels to be too high.
