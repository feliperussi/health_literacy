Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant got.
All of the participants in this study got either MEDI9314 or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug
are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
To see if the participants could join the study, the study doctors did a physical
examination and took blood and urine samples. They also checked the heart health
of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG. The study
doctors also asked about the medical history of the participants, how they felt, and
what medicines they were taking.
All of the participants in this study got either MEDI9314 or the placebo. Different
doses of MEDI9314 were given in the study.
During the study, the participants stayed at their study site for 6 days. On the
second day, they got either MEDI9314 or the placebo as an injection or through a
needle under the skin.
After the 6 days, the participants had 13 follow-up visits for about 8 months. During
these visits, study doctors checked the health of the participants again.
What were the study results?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the website listed at the
end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it also can be
