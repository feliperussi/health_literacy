What drug did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got tezepelumab.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
Each participant got tezepelumab through a needle under the skin, also called a
subcutaneous injection. They got a total of 13 injections over a period of 1 year.
