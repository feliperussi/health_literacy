Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the participants visited their study site 4 times. At these visits, the
doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical examination of the participants and checked their lung health
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During treatment, the participants got either benralizumab or a placebo as an injection
under the skin. The benralizumab dose was 30 milligrams, also called mg.
There were 118 participants who got benralizumab and 115 participants who got the
placebo.
The participants visited their study site 7 times during the treatment period, but they got
benralizumab or the placebo at only 3 visits.
During all of the visits, the doctors checked the lung health of the participants.
After treatment, the participants visited their study site 1 time. This was 4 weeks after
their last treatment visit. At this visit, the doctors checked the participants’ lung health,
overall health, and asked them how they were feeling.
