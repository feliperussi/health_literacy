Clinical Study Results
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how GP MDI affects breathing
in participants with asthma that had not been controlled by their usual asthma
treatments.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one
study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with GP MDI are not planned.
