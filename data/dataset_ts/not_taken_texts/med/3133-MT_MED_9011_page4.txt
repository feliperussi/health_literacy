What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if AZD9150 alone or with durvalumab will help improve the
health of people with advanced solid tumors.
