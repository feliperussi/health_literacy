Clinical Trial RESULTS
One participant did not complete Part B of the study. Part B had 1 group of 8 participants. When
participants took the IntelliCap capsule of AZD9977 in the first dose, researchers programmed the
capsule to slowly release AZD9977 over 12 hours. A second 40 mg dose of AZD9977 in liquid form
was given to the same participants around 1 week later.
During the study, the study doctors and staff did an exam and other tests, and took blood and
urine samples.
After the last treatment, participants had a final visit 5 to 7 days later so researchers could check
their health.
WHAT WERE THE STUDY RESULTS?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked during this study.
It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which
medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD9977 are not
currently planned.
How does the human body process AZD9977 in lower doses compared to higher doses?
Researchers studied the results from Part A to answer this question. For doses from 5 to 400 mg,
researchers found that as the dose of AZD9977 increased, the amount of AZD9977 that was
absorbed in the body increased as well.
The figure below shows the highest amount of AZD9977 in participantsâ€™ blood during the study.
