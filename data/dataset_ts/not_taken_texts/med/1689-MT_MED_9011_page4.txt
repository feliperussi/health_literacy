Clinical Study Results
There are treatments to prevent or treat bacterial pneumonia. But, these treatments
may not work for some people, and they may cause medical problems. The study
drug, MEDI3902, is being developed to help the body’s immune system fight harmful
bacteria that cause pneumonia.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if MEDI3902 helped stop the
participants from developing bacterial pneumonia. The participants were already in
the hospital and were on machines to help them breathe. These participants had
harmful bacteria in their bodies before the study started, but they had not developed
pneumonia.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI3902 affect the number of participants who developed bacterial pneumonia?
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
• What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to learn if MEDI3902 helps improve the health of those at risk of developing
bacterial pneumonia.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either MEDI3902 or a placebo through a needle into
a vein over a period of time. This is known as an infusion. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused
by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting.
Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants
are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research
sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could create a report
of the study results.
