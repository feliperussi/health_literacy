What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
The study doctors kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
The adverse events that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
