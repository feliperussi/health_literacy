What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions the
researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of the
summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on these

Researchers usually need the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did RDEA3170 and febuxostat affect how much protein leaks into the urine?
Overall, the participants who took RDEA3170 and febuxostat together had less protein in
their urine compared to the participants who took the placebos.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ urine albumin-to-
creatinine ratio, also called UACR. Albumin is a protein that controls the amount of water
in cells and the blood. Albumin also helps to move nutrients, hormones and medicines
through the bloodstream. When the kidneys are healthy, they do not allow albumin to leak
from the blood to the urine.
