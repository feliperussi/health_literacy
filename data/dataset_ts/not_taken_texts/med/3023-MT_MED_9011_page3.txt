Clinical Study Results
In this study, Part 1 was the dose escalation study. The researchers also planned to have
a second part of the study. In this part, additional participants would be given a dose that
had been well-tolerated in Part 1 of the study. However, the researchers decided to end
the study after the first part. So, only the results from the first part are included in this
summary. There were 7 dose treatment groups in this study. Each participant took part in
1 of the dose groups.
The treatment in this study was given in “cycles”. Each cycle lasted for 28 days. If
a participant’s cancer was worse at the end of a cycle, or if the dose given was not
tolerated by participants, treatment was stopped. If the treatment was tolerated, the
participant could start a new cycle. The table below shows the different treatment groups
in this study.
