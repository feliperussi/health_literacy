Did the amount of verinurad that got into the blood affect how the
heart beats?
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of verinurad in
the participants’ blood after they took each treatment. The study doctors also
measured how the heart beats using standard ECG. The researchers wanted to
learn if the participants had any abnormal heart activity after taking verinurad.
If they did have abnormal heart activity, the researchers wanted to learn if it
was related to the amount of verinurad in the blood. The researchers used a
mathematical model to find out if the amount of verinurad in the blood affected
how the heart beats.
Overall, the researchers found that the amount of verinurad in the blood had no
effect on how the heart beats.
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Not all of the participants took all of the treatments during the study. The results
below show the medical problems for the number of participants who took each
of the treatments.
