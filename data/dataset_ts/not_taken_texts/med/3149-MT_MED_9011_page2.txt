Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have type 2 diabetes, also
called T2DM.
Dapagliflozin is a drug that is already used to treat people with T2DM. In this study,
the researchers wanted to find out more about how dapagliflozin affects the heart in
participants with T2DM.
T2DM is a condition that causes the levels of blood sugar to rise higher than normal.
T2DM can also cause damage to the heart. This damage can cause heart failure,
cardiovascular events and increase the risk of death.
Treatments for T2DM, such as dapagliflozin, can help lower blood sugar. In earlier
studies in patients with T2DM, researchers found that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of
cardiovascular events for those patients. Researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin
improved how well the heart works in people with T2DM.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin affect the function of the heart?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women
with T2DM. The participants in this study were between 45 and 74 years old. They did not
have any heart problems or other serious medical problems.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant received. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of
the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment each
participant took so they could review the information collected and report the study results.
The participants in this study took either dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by
the drug.
Dapagliflozin and a placebo were taken as tablets. The dose of dapagliflozin was
measured in milligrams, also known as mg. The participants took 10 mg of dapagliflozin
or a placebo tablet once a day in the morning.
