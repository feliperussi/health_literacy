Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with non-small cell lung cancer, also
called NSCLC. All of the participants:
• had a change in a gene called “epidermal growth factor receptor” in their
tumors
• had cancer cells that had spread from the lungs to the brain
A change in a gene is also known as a “mutation”.
The study included 8 participants in the European Union.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat participants who have NSCLC
that has spread to the brain. Before a drug can be approved for people to get,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. NSCLC is a type of lung cancer. Lung cancer cells
can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain.
The study drug, osimertinib, was designed to stop different proteins in the body
from allowing the tumors to grow. Osimertinib is already available as a treatment
for people with certain types of NSCLC.
Sometimes, a drug that works in some parts of the body does not work in the
brain. This can happen if a drug cannot get into the brain. A cell barrier, called
the “blood-brain barrier”, can stop some drugs from getting into the brain.
Researchers need to know if osimertinib can pass through this barrier to know if it
might be able to treat NSCLC that has spread to the brain.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if osimertinib spreads to different
regions of the brain. They used a special form of osimertinib that was labelled with
a small amount of a radioactive substance, known as “radio-labelled osimertinib”.
