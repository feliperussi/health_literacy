Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to stop ovarian cancer from getting worse or
coming back after it has been treated with chemotherapy. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how well it
works and how safe it is.
What treatment did the participants take?
271 of the 272 participants in this study took olaparib after having at least 1 round of
chemotherapy.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took olaparib, how many had a treatment
response?
Overall, the researchers found that 37.4% of the participants had a treatment
response during the study. This was 101 out of 270 participants.
X What medical problems happened during the study?
There were 93.0% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This was
252 out of the 271 participants who took olaparib. The most common medical
problem was nausea.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
