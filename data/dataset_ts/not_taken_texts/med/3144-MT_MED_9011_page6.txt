What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems that happened during the study that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
The following results are for 11 of the 13 participants. This is because 2 participants chose
to leave the study before the researchers could review all of the study results. These 2
participants left the study for personal reasons and not because of any medical problems.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during the study.
