Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The participants were in the study for up to about 1 month. But, the entire study took
about 2 years to finish. The study started in January 2018 and ended in November 2019.
Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 1 time over the
course of about 1 week. During this time, the study doctors checked to make sure the
participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• gave the participants surveys that asked them about their RA symptoms
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site 2 times over the course of about
2 weeks. During this time, they took either 40 mg of AZD9567 or 20 mg of prednisolone
1 time each day. The study doctors also called the participants 1 time to ask them about
their RA symptoms and overall health.
Throughout the study, the study doctors continued performing tests to check the health of
the participants and gave the participants surveys asking them about their RA symptoms.
