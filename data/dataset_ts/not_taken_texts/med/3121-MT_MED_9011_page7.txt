What medical problems happened during
this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. The researchers could not accurately report adverse reactions because
the study ended early.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about whether dapagliflozin worked at
least as well as acarbose in participants with T2D.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results.
Further clinical studies with dapagliflozin are not planned.
