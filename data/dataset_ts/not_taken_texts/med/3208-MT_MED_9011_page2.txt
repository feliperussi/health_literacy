Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, also called COPD. Before a drug can be approved for patients
to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COPD is a long-term condition that causes the airways to narrow or damages the
tiny air sacs in the lungs. This makes it difficult to breathe. There are treatments for
COPD, but these treatments do not work for all patients. Budesonide, glycopyrronium
and formoterol fumarate work to open up the airways. Each of these is used on its
own or in pairs to treat the symptoms of COPD.
This study used a new form of BGF in an inhaler. The BGF had a small amount of
radioactive substance added to it so that it could be seen in images of the lungs.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much BGF got into the lungs
in a small number of healthy participants. This would help them learn how BGF
works before giving it to patients with COPD.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much BGF got into the participants’ lungs?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if BGF improves the health of people with COPD.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy male participants.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking.
All the participants took BGF through an inhaler.
