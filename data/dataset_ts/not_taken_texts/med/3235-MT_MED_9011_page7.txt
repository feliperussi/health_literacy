What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did dapagliflozin with saxagliptin and metformin affect the levels of
HbA1c in the participants’ blood?
Because the sponsor decided to stop the study early, the researchers did not
have enough information to answer this question.
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had
during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study
treatments. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments.
A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse
reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed
together with all of the available data for the study treatments.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
