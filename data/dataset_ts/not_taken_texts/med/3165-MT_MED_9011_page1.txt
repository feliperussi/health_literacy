Thank you!
Thank you to the participants and to the caregivers of the infants and toddlers who
took part in the clinical study for the study drug ticagrelor. AstraZeneca sponsored
this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If your child participated in the study and you have questions about the results,
please speak with the doctor or staff at your childâ€™s study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in March 2018 and ended in May 2019.
The study included 21 infants and toddlers in Belgium, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon,
Spain, and the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
