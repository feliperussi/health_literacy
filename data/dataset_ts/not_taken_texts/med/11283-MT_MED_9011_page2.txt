Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men of Japanese or Chinese ethnic
origin who live in the United States. The participants in this study were 22 to 47
years old when they joined.
The study included 32 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart disease. Before a drug
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
When the body makes too much of a protein called myeloperoxidase, also
called “MPO”, it can sometimes be a factor in causing heart disease.
AZD4831 may be able to help reduce the levels of MPO in the body. Having
a lower amount of MPO may help improve the health of people with heart
disease.
What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of AZD4831 in
healthy men of Japanese and Chinese ethnic origin.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if AZD4831 improves the health of people who have heart
disease.
