Clinical Study Results
The study doctors found that there were some participants who developed
antibodies against MEDI9090 within the first 30 days of getting treatment:
• 5.1% of the participants had antibodies against durvalumab. This was 2 out of 39
participants.
• 7.7% of the participants had antibodies against tremelimumab. This was 3 out of 39
participants.
Having these antibodies in the participants’ blood did not seem to affect their
health. Based on these results, the study doctors concluded that the participants
did not have a strong immune reaction against MEDI9090.
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital
care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the study drugs.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
