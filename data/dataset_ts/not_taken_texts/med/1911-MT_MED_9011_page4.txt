Clinical Trial Results
How did AZD7594 and abediterol act in the body when they were taken alone and
taken together?
Researchers looked at how AZD7594 and abediterol acted in the body when participants took
the drugs alone and together. Researchers looked at the following:
• The total amount of the study drugs in the blood
• The highest amount of the study drugs in the blood
• The time it took for the study drugs to reach their highest amounts in the blood
Overall, researchers found that participants had about the same total and highest amounts of
AZD7594 and abediterol in their blood, whether they took the study drugs alone or together.
Both study drugs took about the same length of time to reach their highest amounts in the blood
of participants.
Total amount of the study drugs in the blood
Researchers measured the total amount of AZD7594 in picomole hours per liter of blood, or
h•pmol/L. Researchers measured the total amount of abediterol in picogram hours per milliliter
of blood, or h•pg/mL. These are widely accepted scientific units of measurement. The charts below
show the total amounts of the study drugs that participants had in their blood.
