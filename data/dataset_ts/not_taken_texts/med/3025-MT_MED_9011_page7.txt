Clinical Study Results
Did the participants’ quality of life change after taking study treatment?
Overall, the researchers could not know if taking savolitinib changed the
participants’ quality of life compared to sunitinib.
To answer this question, the researchers used two surveys. The first was the
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, also called FACIT-F.
The other was the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom
Index-19, also called FKSI-19. These surveys asked the participants questions
about their cancer symptoms and daily activities. The participants answered the
surveys before they took study treatment, and throughout the study. The doctors
gave the participants’ symptoms scores based on their responses. In both surveys,
a lower score meant a better quality of life.
The researchers found that both the participants who took savolitinib and those
who took sunitinib had lower scores after taking study treatment than at the start
of the study. But, there were not enough data points for the researchers to know if
savolitinib changed the participants’ quality of life compared to sunitinib.
FACIT-F scores
• The scores in the participants who took savolitinib were an average of
24.2 points lower at the end of the study.
• The scores in the participants who took sunitinib were an average of
23.3 points lower at the end of the study.
FKSI-19 scores
• The scores in the participants who took savolitinib were an average of
3.8 points lower at the end of the study.
• The scores in the participants who took sunitinib were an average of
8.0 points lower at the end of the study.
