Clinical Trial RESULTS
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers
asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the
results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest
for patients. Further clinical studies with osimertinib are ongoing.
How much of the study drug reaches the blood after participants take
osimertinib in tablet form?
Researchers measured an amount and then calculated an average
for osimertinib that reached the blood after participants took the
tablet form followed by the injection form. After taking the 80 mg of
tablet, participants had an average of 6791 nanomole hours (nM*h) of
osimertinib in their blood. Nanomole hours are a unit of measurement that
researchers use to see how much of the study drug is in participants’ blood
over time. After getting the 100 µg injection of osimertinib, participants
had an average of 12.1 nM*h of osimertinib in their blood. Overall,
researchers found that an average of 70% of the study drug reached
participants’ blood after taking the dose orally as a tablet compared to
injecting the dose straight into the blood.
