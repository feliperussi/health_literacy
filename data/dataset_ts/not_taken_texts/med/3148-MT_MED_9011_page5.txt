Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during the study.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
There were 14.3% of participants with adverse reactions during the study. This was
2 out of 14 participants. None of the participants stopped taking AZD5718 because of
adverse reactions they had during the study.
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
Dizziness and headache were the only adverse reactions during the study:
• There were 14.3% of participants who felt dizzy. This was 2 out of 14 participants.
• There were 7.1% of participants who had a headache. This was 1 out of 14 participants.
All of these adverse reactions happened during the first part of the study.
How has this study helped participants and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how different formulations of AZD5718
work in healthy participants.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD5718 are planned.
