What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did taking cyclosporine or rifampicin together with verinurad affect how much
verinurad remained in the participantsâ€™ blood during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if verinurad helps improve the health of people who have CKD.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took:
X Treatment 1: verinurad with allopurinol
X Treatment 2: verinurad with allopurinol and cyclosporine
X Treatment 3: verinurad with allopurinol and rifampicin
All of the participants took all 3 treatments in the order shown above. They took
verinurad and cyclosporine as capsules by mouth, and the other drugs as tablets
by mouth.
The participants in this study took verinurad together with allopurinol, which
decreases the amount of uric acid made by the body. Allopurinol is an approved
drug that has been used in other clinical studies with verinurad.
