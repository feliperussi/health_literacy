In the future, the researchers would like to find out:
• How effective is AZD1222 in participants who are over 55 years old?
– Most of the participants in these trials who were over 55 years old joined
later than other participants. Because of this, there had not yet been enough
infections in this group of participants for the researchers to measure the
efficacy.
• For how long does AZD1222 protect participants from COVID-19?
Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which vaccines are most
effective and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from these
4 trials that are in this 1 medical article. Other trials may provide new information
or different results.
Where can I learn more about these trials?
This summary is based on a publication called ‘Single-dose administration and the influence of the
timing of the booster dose on immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine:
a pooled analysis of four randomised trials’. It was published in The Lancet in March 2021. You can read
