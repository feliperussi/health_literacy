Clinical Trial Results
Each participant got 1 of 7 AZD5634 treatments or the placebo:
• 10 µg
• 27 µg
• 81 µg
• 216 µg
• 648 µg
• 1296 µg
• 1692 µg
• placebo
Overall, there were 43 participants who got AZD5634 and 14 participants who got the placebo
during Part A.
The figure below shows how Part A of the study was done.
Part A of the study: 57 participants
First visit Second visit Third visit Fourth visit
(screening visit) (treatment visit) (first follow-up visit) (second follow-up visit)
57 participants 4 days 7 to 10 days after 2 months after
second visit second visit
Participants got
either AZD5634 or
placebo treatment
Part B started after Part A ended.
During Part B, participants were in the study for up to 4 months. All 6 participants visited the
study site 5 times. At the first visit, researchers made sure participants could join the study. During
the second and third visits, participants stayed at the study site for 4 days.
During the second visit, all 6 participants got 65 µg of AZD5634 through a plastic tube put into
their vein. This process is called an infusion. During the third visit, all participants got 1692 µg
of AZD5634 through a nebulizer.
There was a “washout period” of 14 days between getting the infusion and using the nebulizer.
This means that when participants get the next study treatment, the previous drug treatment has
been processed and “washed out” from the body. During this time, there are also certain drugs
that participants are not allowed to take.
