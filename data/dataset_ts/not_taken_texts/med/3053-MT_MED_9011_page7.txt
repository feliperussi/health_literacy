Clinical Study Results
In Part 2 of the study:
How many participants had adverse events?
• 87.3% of participants had adverse events. This was 131 out of 150 participants.
• 18.0% of participants had serious adverse events. This was 27 out of 150
participants.
• 1.3% of participants died due to adverse events. This was 2 out of 150 participants.
• 8.0% of participants stopped taking ZS because of adverse events. This was 12 out
of 150 participants.
What serious adverse events did the participants have?
The most common serious adverse event was heart failure. Heart failure is a condition
in which the heart is not able to pump enough blood around the body. The table below
shows the serious adverse events that happened in 2 or more participants. There were
other serious adverse events, but these happened in fewer participants.
Serious adverse events in 2 or more participants
during Part 2 of the study
ZS once a day or
every other day
(out of 150 participants)
Heart failure caused by a
build-up of fluid around 2.7% (4)
the heart
Lung infection 2.0% (3)
Vision problems (cataract) 1.3% (2)
2 participants died during the study. The researchers did not think that these deaths were
related to ZS. 1 participant died from cancer and the other died from heart failure.
