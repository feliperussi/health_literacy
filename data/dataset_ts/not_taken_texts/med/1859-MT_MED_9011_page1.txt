Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: AZD9567
Study Title: A study to learn about the safety of different AZD9567 doses
in healthy participants
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD9567. AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share
the results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2016 and ended in September 2017.
The study included 77 participants in Germany and the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with inflammatory
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, also called RA. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out if it works
and how safe it is.
RA is a condition in which a person’s immune system does not work correctly. This
can cause the immune system to attack the body’s tissues, joints, and organs. This
can lead to pain and swelling in the body.
The study drug, AZD9567, is being developed to treat patients with RA. In this
study, the researchers wanted to learn more about different AZD9567 doses and
if they are safe to take. They also wanted to compare AZD9567 to a drug called
prednisolone that is currently used to treat RA.
