Clinical Trial RESULTS
Total amount of study drugs in participants’ blood
Researchers compared the average total amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol
in the blood of participants after taking the combined tablet (Dose A) to the
total amounts after taking separate tablets (Dose B). Researchers measured the
amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol that stayed in participants’ blood over
time in microgram hours per milliliter, or μg·hr/mL. This is a widely accepted
scientific unit of measurement.
The picture below shows the results for Doses A and B.

Highest level of study drugs in participants’ blood
Researchers compared the average highest levels of lesinurad and allopurinol in
participants’ blood after they took the combined tablet (Dose A) to the average
highest levels after they took separate tablets (Dose B). Researchers measured
these levels in micrograms per milliliter, or μg/mL. The picture below shows
the results for Doses A and B.
