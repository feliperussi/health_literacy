Overall, the researchers found that the average amounts of AZD4635 in the
blood were higher when the participants took it with fluvoxamine. This means
that fluvoxamine increased the amount of AZD4635 that got into the participants’
blood. This is likely to be because fluvoxamine affected CYP1A2. Based on these
results the researchers think other drugs that affect CYP1A2 may also affect the
amount of AZD4635 that gets into the blood.
Overall, the researchers found that the average amounts of AZD4635 in the blood
were not different in the participants who were smokers compared with those who
were non-smokers. This means that smoking did not affect the amount of AZD4635
that got into the participants’ blood.
