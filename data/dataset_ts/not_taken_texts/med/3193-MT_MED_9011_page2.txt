Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before and
after a drug is approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
All of the participants in this study got benralizumab.
The participants also continued to take their regular asthma treatments called
“oral corticosteroids”. During the study, they decreased the dose of oral
corticosteroids to the lowest dose they needed to control their asthma. For
some participants, this was no oral corticosteroids.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How many participants no longer needed oral corticosteroids to
control their asthma after getting benralizumab?
Overall, 62.9% of participants no longer needed daily oral corticosteroids
to control their asthma after getting benralizumab. There were also
81.9% of participants who either no longer needed oral corticosteroids to
control their asthma or only needed oral corticosteroids to control other
conditions besides asthma after getting benralizumab.
X Did the participants feel that getting benralizumab while taking a
lower dose of oral corticosteroids or no oral corticosteroids helped
them control their asthma symptoms and helped their quality of life?
Overall, the participants felt that taking a lower dose of oral
corticosteroids and getting benralizumab helped them control their
asthma symptoms and improved their quality of life.
