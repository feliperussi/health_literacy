Clinical Study Results
In this study, the participants took MEDI0382 or a placebo through a needle unde r
the skin, also called a subcutaneous injection.A placebo looks like a drug but does
not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of th e
effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
The doses of MEDI0382 were measured in micrograms, also known as μg. The
participants in the MEDI0382 group took increasing doses over 32 days:
• 50 μg for 4 days
• 100 μg for 7 days
• 200 μg for 7 days
• 300 μg for 14 days
A computer program was used to randomly choose the group each participant was
in. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each group is as accurate as possible.
In this study, it was planned that 21 participants would take MEDI0382 and 20
participants would take a placebo.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took the study treatment, the doctors checked the
overall health of the participants to make sure that they could join the study.T his
happened up to 40 days before the participants took study treatment. During this
time, the participants visited the study site 3 times. The study staff or doctors:
• did a physical examination
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• checked the participants’ blood pressure
• took blood samples
• asked about the participants’ health and medications
• showed the participants how to give themselves injections of the study treatment
