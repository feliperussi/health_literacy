What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did saxagliptin have any effect on the participants’ heart function?
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know to find out if saxagliptin can
be used to treat T2DM without having any negative effects on the heart.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took either:
> saxagliptin and a placebo, or
> sitagliptin and a placebo, or
> 2 placebos
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use
a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took their randomly chosen study treatment as tablets or capsules
by mouth once a day for 24 weeks. The doses of saxagliptin and sitagliptin were
measured in milligrams, also called mg. The dose that each participant received
was based on their kidney function.
