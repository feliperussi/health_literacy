Clinical Trial RESULTS
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked during the study.
It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which
doses work the best and are the safest for patients. Further clinical studies with lesinurad and
allopurinol are currently planned.
How much lesinurad and allopurinol stayed in participants’ blood when taken
as a combined tablet compared to separate tablets?
Overall, researchers found that participants had about the same amount of lesinurad and
allopurinol in their blood no matter which dose they took. This was also true of the highest
amount of the study drug measured at any time while participants were in the study.
Average total amount of study drugs in the blood
Researchers compared the average amount of lesinurad and allopurinol in the blood of
participants in Groups 1 and 3. Researchers measured the amount of lesinurad and allopurinol
that stayed in participants’ blood in microgram hours per milliliter, or μg*hr/mL.
The figure below shows the results for Doses A, B, E, and F.
