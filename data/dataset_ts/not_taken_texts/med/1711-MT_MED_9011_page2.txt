Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with type 2 diabetes and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called NAFLD. The participants in this study
were 41 to 67 years old when they joined.
The study included 14 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat NAFLD in people with type 2
diabetes, also called T2DM. Before a drug can be approved for people to get,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with T2DM, the body does not make enough insulin. Insulin is a
hormone that controls the level of blood sugar, which is also called glucose. T2DM
causes blood glucose levels to rise higher than normal, which can cause medical
problems.
Some people with T2DM can have inflammation and a build-up of fat in their liver
that is not linked to drinking alcohol. This is NAFLD. The build-up of liver fat can
increase the risk of health problems such as liver disease, but also other diseases
including heart attack and stroke. This is even more dangerous for people with
T2DM who already have an increased risk of liver disease and cardiovascular
disease.
The study drug, AZD4076, was designed to make the body more sensitive to
insulin and to reduce fat in the liver. In this study, the researchers wanted to find
out more about the safety of AZD4076 in participants with T2DM and NAFLD.
They also wanted to find out if AZD4076 changed the amount of blood sugar and
liver fat in the participants.
