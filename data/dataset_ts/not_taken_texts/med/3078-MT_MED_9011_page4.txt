Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited the study site at
least 1 time. This was up to 21 days before they started the study. At this visit, the
study doctors checked the participants’ overall health to make sure that they could
join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• asked the participants about their medical history
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• checked how the cancer affected the participants’ life and daily activities
• took a tumour biopsy if none had been taken in the last 6 weeks
• asked the participants about their health and any medications they were taking
During the study, the participants visited the study site up to 3 times, including
the day of their surgery. On the first visit, the participants started getting either
AZD9496 or fulvestrant. The study doctors:
• checked vital signs
• took blood samples
• asked the participants about their health and any medications they were taking
On the second visit, the study doctors also took a tumour biopsy and did an ECG.
The participants who took AZD9496 took the last dose in the morning of the day
when the biopsy was taken.
After getting the last dose of study treatment, the participants visited the
study site 1 more time after about 28 days. At this visit, the study doctors checked
the participants’ health and asked about any medications they were taking.
