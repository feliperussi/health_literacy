36 participants
Group 2 Dose C or D on Day 1 Dose C or D on Day 8 Follow-up visit around Day 15
28 participants
Group 3 Dose E or F on Day 1 Dose E or F on Day 8 Follow-up visit around Day 15

Participants in Group 1 and Group 2 were assigned by chance, like flipping a coin,
to 1 of 2 doses. Group 3 participants were added later to the study.
Group 1 had 36 participants. On Day 1 and Day 8, participants took one of the below:
• Dose A: One combined 200/300-milligram (mg) tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol
• Dose B: One 200-mg tablet of lesinurad and one 300-mg tablet of allopurinol
Group 2 had 28 participants. On Day 1 and Day 8, participants took either:
• Dose C: One combined 200/300-mg tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol given
without food
• Dose D: One combined 200/300-mg tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol given
with food
Group 3 had 55 participants. On Day 1, participants took one of the below doses, and on
Day 8 they took the other:
• Dose E: One combined 200/200-mg tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol
• Dose F: One 200-mg tablet of lesinurad and two 100-mg tablets of allopurinol
all participants took 2 doses during the study.
On Day 1, they took 1 dose. Then on Day 8, they took the other dose for their group.
Participants went back to the study site for a follow-up visit around Day 15, about 1 week
after their last dose with the study drugs. Study doctors did a physical exam, took blood
and urine samples, and answered questions about any medical problems and other drugs
participants were taking.
