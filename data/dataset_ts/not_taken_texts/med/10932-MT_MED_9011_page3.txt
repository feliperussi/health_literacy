Clinical Study Results
The treatment doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the
participants took each treatment. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site at least 1
time over the course of about 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked to
make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
• explained to the participants how to take their inhaler treatments during the
study
During the study, the participants visited their study site 3 times over the course
of about 3 weeks. The participants stayed at their study site for 2 days during each
of these visits.
At each visit, the participants took 2 puffs of 1 of the below inhaler treatments:
• inhaled dose of 80 μg of budesonide
• inhaled dose of 90 μg of albuterol sulfate
• combined inhaled doses of 80 μg of budesonide and 90 μg of albuterol sulfate
There was a “washout period” of about 1 week in between each visit. During this
time, the participants did not take any study treatment. This was done so that
each treatment could be “washed out” of their bodies before they took the next
treatment.
After the participants got their last treatment, they visited their study site 1
time about 1 week after they got their final study treatment. At this visit, the study
doctors checked the participants’ health and asked them how they were feeling.
