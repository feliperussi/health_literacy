Clinical Study Results
The potassium levels were measured in millimoles per liter, also called mmol/L. This
measurement is commonly used by researchers to study blood and other fluids in the
body. Researchers generally consider normal potassium levels to be between 3.5 mmol/L
and 5.0 mmol/L.
At the end of Part 2, the researchers found:
• The participants who took 5 g of ZS had an average potassium level of 4.8 mmol/L
• The participants who took 10 g of ZS had an average potassium level of 4.4 mmol/L
• The participants who took the placebo had an average potassium level of 5.3 mmol/L
The figure below shows these results.

Did ZS affect the participants’ overall health?
No. The researchers found that throughout the study, the participants had very little
change in their overall health.
To answer this question, the researchers gave the participants surveys throughout the
study that asked them how they were feeling. In general, participants’ survey scores did
not change throughout the study.
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
