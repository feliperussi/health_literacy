Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 20 to 55 years old when they joined.
The study included 14 participants in Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic kidney disease, also
known as “CKD”. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Verinurad is being developed as a possible treatment for CKD. Verinurad
decreases the blood levels of a chemical in the body known as uric acid. It does
this by stopping the activity of a protein in the kidneys called URAT-1. This helps
the kidneys to remove the uric acid from the blood into the urine, instead of
reabsorbing it back up into the blood. Researchers think that high levels of uric
acid in the blood may cause more kidney damage. They believe that limiting the
amount of uric acid that is taken back up into the body may help people with
CKD.
People with CKD often take several other drugs. These drugs might affect how the
body breaks down verinurad, which could lead to levels of verinurad in the blood
that are too high or too low. Researchers need to know if taking cyclosporine or
rifampicin affects how the body breaks down verinurad to learn if taking other
medications may also affect how verinurad acts in the body.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if taking either cyclosporine or
rifampicin affected how much verinurad remained in the participants’ blood during
the study.
