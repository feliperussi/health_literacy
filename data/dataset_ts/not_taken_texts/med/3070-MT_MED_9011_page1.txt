Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drugs Studied: Dapagliflozin and metformin
Study Title: A study to learn if the same amount of dapagliflozin/metformin gets into
the blood when the tablets are made in the mainland United States or in
Puerto Rico
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drugs dapagliflozin and
metformin. AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results.
An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor
or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in January 2018 and ended in January 2019. The sponsor reviewed the data
collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 288 participants in Brazil.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers want to know if a drug works in the same way when it is made in a factory in
the mainland United States as when it is made in a factory in Puerto Rico. This is because
the company that makes the drug wants to move its manufacturing process for this drug from
Puerto Rico to the mainland United States. Before some drugs can be made in a new location,
researchers need to do clinical studies to find out if the drug can be made in the same way. The
drug that was tested in this study is to treat type 2 diabetes.
In people with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin. Insulin is made by the
pancreas and controls the levels of sugar in the blood. If a person’s blood sugar levels become
too high, he or she can have medical problems.
The study drugs, dapagliflozin and metformin, were designed to help lower the amount of sugar
in the blood. Dapagliflozin does this by helping the body remove sugar through urine. Metformin
does this by lowering the amount of sugar made by the liver. In this study, the study drugs were
taken together in a dapagliflozin/metformin tablet. The researchers wanted to find out if the same
amount of a version of dapagliflozin/metformin tablets made in the mainland United States got
into the participants’ blood as a version made in Puerto Rico.
