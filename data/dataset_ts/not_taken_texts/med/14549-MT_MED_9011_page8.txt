How did the participants receive the vaccine?
All of the participants in all 4 of the trials received either AZD1222 or the control
as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.
The amount of vaccine in each injection is measured in units called “1010 viral
particles”. A unit of 1 × 1010 viral particles is equal to 10,000,000,000 viral
particles.
In COV001, the dose level of the AZD1222 injection was 5 × 1010 viral particles.
This is known as the standard dose level.
When this trial first started, it was planned that the participants who received
AZD1222 would get only 1 injection. After the researchers started looking at the
results from the first few participants, they decided that the remaining participants
should get a second injection. This was because of the results of 10 participants at
the beginning of the trial. In these 10 participants, their immune responses were
stronger when they received 2 injections. Those results are in a different medical
article and are not in this summary.
In COV002, the researchers planned to give the participants the standard dose
level of AZD1222.
The researchers realised that about a third of the participants who received
AZD1222 had been given a lower dose level of 2.2 × 1010 viral particles for their
first injection. This is known as the low dose level.
All of the participants who got AZD1222 in COV002 received the standard dose
level for their second injection. The majority of COV002 participants waited at
least 12 weeks between each injection.
In COV003, all of the participants who got AZD1222 received 2 standard
dose level injections. There was an average of less than 6 weeks between each
injection.
In COV005, almost all of the participants who got AZD1222 received 2 standard
dose level injections. There was a very small number of participants who received
the low dose level of AZD1222 for 1 of their injections. There was an average of
4 weeks between each injection.
