Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the study doctors and the participant knew what the
participant was getting.
In this study, the participants got their treatment during periods called “cycles.” The participants
could take part in as many cycles as they wanted unless their cancer got worse. If their cancer
got worse, the participants stopped the treatment cycles. If the study treatment was helping the
participants’ cancer at the end of the study, the participants could choose to continue treatment.
There were 3 treatment groups during the study: Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3. The treatments
are listed below:
• Group 1 - durvalumab alone
• Group 2 - durvalumab and tremelimumab
• Group 3 - SOC treatment
The study doctors chose the SOC treatment that the participants got. In this study, the doctors
used different combinations of cancer drugs for the SOC treatment. These cancer drugs are
listed below
• paclitaxel
• carboplatin
• gemcitabine
• cisplatin
• pemetrexed
Durvalumab, tremelimumab, and the SOC treatment were given through a needle into the vein.
This is known as intravenous infusion, also called IV infusion. The doses were measured in
milligrams per kilograms of body weight, also called mg/kg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment that each participant got. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
