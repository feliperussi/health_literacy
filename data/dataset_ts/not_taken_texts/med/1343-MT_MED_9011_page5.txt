Clinical Trial RESULTS
How much AZD7594 reached the blood through the stomach only?
Researchers found that:
• When the participants were given AZD7594 as a liquid through the mouth, very little
of the study drug reached the bloodstream. The amount was less than 1% of the
amount of AZD7594 found in participants’ bloodstreams when the study drug was
given as an IV therapy.
How much AZD7594 reached the blood through the lungs and stomach together?
Researchers found that:
• Participants in Part 2 who used DPI 1 had an average of 28.2% of AZD7594 reach their
bloodstream through the lungs and stomach together.
• Participants in Group 1 of Part 3 who used DPI 2 had an average of 30.9% of AZD7594
reach their bloodstream through the lungs and stomach together.
How did AZD7594 act in the body when participants took it using DPI 1 compared with
DPI 2 or a pMDI?
Researchers found:
• The levels of AZD7594 in the bloodstream following the dose given though
the DPI 1 was 28% of the amount in the bloodstream when the dose was given
as an IV therapy. For DPI 2, that number was 31 %.
• The levels of AZD7594 in the bloodstream following the dose given as a liquid
through the mouth were very low, less than 1 % of the amount in the bloodstream
when AZD7594 was given as an IV therapy.
• While comparing the 2 DPI inhalers to each other, researchers found that the
amounts of AZD7594 in the bloodstream after participants took those doses were
about the same. The highest amount of AZD7594 found in the bloodstream following
a dose from DPI 2 was 60% of the total amount of AZD7594 found in the bloodstream
following a dose from DPI 1.
• When the pMDI was used, very low amounts of AZD7594 were found in the
bloodstream. The researchers did not know why these amounts were so low.
An additional group of participants took a second pMDI and the amounts of
AZD7594 found in the bloodstream were also very low.
• When AZD7594 was inhaled using DPI 1 and DPI 2, the amounts of AZD7594 in the
blood dropped much slower compared to when AZD7594 was given as an IV therapy.
It took between 27 and 83 hours for half of the AZD7594 to leave the bloodstream
when the inhalers were used.
