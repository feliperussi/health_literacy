Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew
what the participants were taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the injection device treatment each
participant took. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is
as accurate as possible.
What happened during this study?
Before this study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make sure the
participants could join this study. They also took blood and urine samples and checked
the heart health of participants using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG. The
doctors also asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking.
The participants were in this study for about 3 months. They visited their study site 11 times.
There were 2 treatments in this study. Both treatments had the same dose of
benralizumab. But, the treatments were taken in different injection devices. The
participants took 1 of these 2 treatments once during this study.
The participants had a follow-up visit at the end of this study. During this visit, the
doctors checked the health of the participants again.
