Clinical Trial Results
The chart below shows the total change in the amount of good cholesterol in the blood
over the first 96 hours after treatment with MEDI6012 or placebo. The amount of good
cholesterol in the blood was measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood, or mg/dL. This
is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.

Treatment group
Researchers found that the amount of good cholesterol in the blood increased the most
for the participants who got the Dose 4 IV of MEDI6012.
Researchers also found that:
• By Days 8 and 15 after getting treatment, the amount of good cholesterol in the
blood returned to the levels participants had before getting MEDI6012.
• Participants who got higher doses of MEDI6012 had higher levels of good
cholesterol in their blood.
How did MEDI6012 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to know how the study drug acted in the body. So they measured:
• The average amount of MEDI6012 in the blood
• The highest amount of MEDI6012 in the blood
• How long it took for MEDI6012 to reach its highest amount in the blood
