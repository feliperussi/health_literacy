What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took olaparib, how many had a treatment response?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if olaparib helps improve the health of people with ovarian cancer.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took olaparib.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The participants took olaparib as tablets by mouth. The dose of olaparib was
measured in milligrams, also known as “mg”. The study doctors could reduce
the dose of olaparib for participants if they had any medical problems during the
study. The participants took olaparib until their cancer got worse or came back,
until the study doctors thought they should stop study treatment, or until they left
the study for another reason.
The chart below shows the treatment the researchers planned to study.
