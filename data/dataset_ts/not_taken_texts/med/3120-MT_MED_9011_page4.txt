Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited the study site 1 time.
This was up to 20 days before they started the study. At this visit, the doctors checked the
participants’ overall health to make sure that they could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history, health, and medications
During Part A and Part B, and after the participants’ last study treatment, the doctors
also checked the participants’ health and took blood and urine samples. They also
checked the participants’ heart using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
During Part A of the study, the participants visited the study site 2 times. They
could choose to stay overnight at each visit. In the first treatment period of Part A, the
participants took caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam. Between Treatment Periods 1
and 2, the participants did not take any study treatment for between 7 and 14 days. In
the second treatment period, they took caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam. They also
took adavosertib. The participants waited between 7 and 14 days before taking study
treatment in Part B.
During Part B of the study, the participants visited the study site every day for 5 days.
They could choose to stay overnight at each visit. The participants took adavosertib.
