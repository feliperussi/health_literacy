ACQ-6
The participants received scores from 0 to 6 on each question based on their
responses to the ACQ-6. Then, the researchers calculated average scores. A high
average score meant that the participant’s asthma was not well controlled. A low
average score meant that the participant’s asthma was well controlled.
The researchers compared the average scores before treatment to after 48 weeks
of treatment. They compared the results for the participants who got tezepelumab
to those who got the placebo. A decrease in average score meant that the
participants felt that study treatment helped control their asthma.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average ACQ-6 scores was:
> a decrease of 0.87 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> a decrease of 0.51 for the participants who got the placebo
EQ-5D-5L
In the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, participants reported their health in a visual
way. They marked a point on a line between ‘The best health you can imagine’
and ‘The worst health you can imagine’, also called a visual analogue scale. The
placement of each point was turned into a score. The higher the score, the better
the participant felt about their quality of life.
The researchers compared the average EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale scores
before treatment to after 48 weeks of treatment. They compared the results for
the participants who got tezepelumab to those who got the placebo. An increase
in average EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale score meant that the participants felt
that the study treatment helped their quality of life.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average EQ-5D-5L score was:
> an increase of 9.21 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> an increase of 2.00 for the participants who got the placebo
