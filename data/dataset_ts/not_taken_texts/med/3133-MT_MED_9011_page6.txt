What happened during the study?
The study started in January 2018 and ended in April 2019.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. The visit happened about 4 weeks before the participants got study
treatment. At this visit, the study doctors made sure that the participants could
join the study. The study doctors:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
> did a procedure called a biopsy to take a sample of the participants’ tumors, if
needed
> took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were getting study treatment in Week 1, they
stayed overnight at the study site for 1 week and got 3 doses of AZD9150.
While the participants were getting study treatment from Week 2 and
onwards, they visited their study site once a week.
At each of these visits, the participants got their IV infusions of AZD9150. The
participants in Group 2 got their IV infusions of durvalumab every 4 weeks.
The participants continued getting study treatment for as long as their cancer did
not get worse.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 2
times. This part of the study lasted up to 1 month for the participants in Group
1 and up to 3 months for the participants in Group 2. At these visits, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants.
