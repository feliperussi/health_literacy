What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got acalabrutinib through a tube in the nose and
rabeprazole as a tablet by mouth.
This study was a “crossover” study. There were 2 groups of participants. A
crossover study means that all of the participants got the same 3 treatments, but
the 2 groups got the treatments in a different order.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The chart below shows the 3 treatments the researchers studied.
