Clinical Study Results
Were the AZD9977 levels in the blood similar when the participants took the
different forms of the drug?
No. Overall, the levels of AZD9977 in the participants’ blood were different depending on
which form they were taking.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the average and highest levels of
AZD9977 in the blood throughout Part A. They compared the results from when the
participants took the liquid form of AZD9977 with the results from when they took each of
the pill forms of AZD9977.
The average and highest levels of AZD9977 in the blood were:
• highest when the participants took the liquid form
• lowest when the participants took Pill 3
• higher when the participants took Pill 1 compared to when they took Pill 2 or Pill 3
Because the researchers were focusing on learning more about the different AZD9977 pills,
the researchers chose to use one of the pills to answer the next question in Part B. So, even
though the AZD9977 levels were highest in the blood when the participants took the liquid
form of the study drug, the researchers chose Pill 1 to answer the next question in Part B.
The researchers chose Pill 1 over the other pills because the AZD9977 levels in the blood
were highest when the participants took Pill 1 compared to when they took Pill 2 or Pill 3.
Were the AZD9977 levels in the blood similar when the drug was taken with
and without food?
Overall, the average levels of AZD9977 in the blood were similar when the participants
took AZD9977 with food compared to when they took it without food. But, the highest
levels of AZD9977 in the blood were higher when the participants took AZD9977 with food
compared to when they took it without food.
To answer this question, the researchers compared the average and highest levels of
AZD9977 in the participants’ blood after taking Pill 1 without food in Part A to those levels
after taking Pill 1 with food in Part B.
For Pill 1 in both parts of the study, the researchers measured:
• the average levels of AZD9977 in the blood during the study
• the average levels of AZD9977 in the blood at the end of the study
• the highest levels of AZD9977 in the blood during the study
The average levels were measured in nanomole hours per liter, also called h•nmol/L. The
highest levels were measured in nanomoles per liter, also called nmol/L.
