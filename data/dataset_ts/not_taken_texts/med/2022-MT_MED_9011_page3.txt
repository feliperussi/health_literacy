Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment and throughout the study, the doctors checked the participants’
health to make sure they could continue in the study. The doctors did tests and exams,
gave surveys to ask how the participants were feeling, and measured the participants’
potassium levels.
During Part 1, the participants visited their study site up to 2 times. These visits
happened once a day for 2 days in a row. During both visits, the participants took ZS
by mouth as a powder with water. Doses were measured in grams, also called g. The
participants took 10 g of ZS up to 3 times a day at both visits.
After taking ZS in Part 1, the participants visited their study site 1 more time so the
doctors could check their health and potassium levels again. If a participant’s potassium
had reached normal levels by the time of this visit, the participant could continue into Part 2.
If a participant’s potassium had not reached normal levels, the participant did not continue
into Part 2 and came back to the site about 1 week later for the end of study visit.
The chart below shows how Part 1 of the study was done.
