Did the participants feel that durvalumab alone affected their
symptoms and quality of life compared with standard treatment?
To answer this question, the trial doctors looked at the results from the EORTC
QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire showed that:
X The participants who got durvalumab alone felt some improvement in
quality of life, ability to do daily tasks, appetite, and fatigue levels compared
with those who got standard treatment.
The EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaire showed that:
X The participants who got durvalumab alone felt less abdominal pain than
those who got standard treatment.
What medical problems did the doctors
report as possibly related to the trial
treatments?
This section is a summary of the medical problems that the participants had
during this trial that the doctors reported as possibly related to the trial
treatments. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An
adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care. The results from several trials are
needed to decide if a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
trial.
There were 22 participants who joined the trial but did not get any trial
treatment. So, the results below are for 1,302 out of 1,324 participants.
