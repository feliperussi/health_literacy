To answer this question, the researchers kept track of the participants’ symptoms
and how they felt by asking them to complete a questionnaire called Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Bladder, also known as FACT-BL. The
researchers gave the participants “scores” based on their answers to the FACT-BL
questionnaire. They compared the scores throughout the study. A bigger change
in FACT-BL score meant that the participants’ symptoms were more severe. The
scores were measured in points.
The researchers found that the participants’ FACT-BL scores changed by an
average of:
> 4.7 points in the participants getting MEDI4736 alone
> 7.2 points in the participants getting MEDI4736 with tremelimumab
> 8.8 points in the participants getting chemotherapy
The study doctors also used some of the participants’ answers from the FACT-BL
questionnaire to get a score called FACT-BL Trial Outcome Index, also known as
FACT-BL TOI. A bigger change in FACT-BL TOI score meant that the participants’
symptoms were more severe. The researchers compared the scores throughout
the study.
The researchers found that the participants’ FACT-BL TOI scores changed by an
average of:
> 3.9 points in the participants getting MEDI4736 alone
> 5.5 points in the participants getting MEDI4736 with tremelimumab
> 7.2 points in the participants getting chemotherapy
