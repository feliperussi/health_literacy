Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat STEMIs. All of the participants in
this study had a STEMI. In this summary we will use the term “heart attack” instead
of “STEMI”. Before a drug can be approved for people to receive, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants receive?
The participants in this study received MEDI6012 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did MEDI6012 help reduce heart muscle damage after a heart attack?
Overall, the researchers found that there were some small reductions in the
participants’ heart muscle damage. But, the difference between the participants
who received MEDI6012 and those who received the placebo was too small for
the researchers to know if MEDI6012 reduced heart muscle damage.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 1.6% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This was
9 out of 575 participants. The most common medical problem was abnormal
electrical activity of the heart that affects its rhythm.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
