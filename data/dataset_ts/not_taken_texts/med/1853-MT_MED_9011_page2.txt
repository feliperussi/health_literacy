Clinical Trial RESULTS
WHAT’S HAPPENED SINCE MY STUDY ENDED?
This study started in July 2015 and ended in November 2015. It included 70 participants at
1 study site in the United Kingdom. When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data
and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
WHY WAS THE RESEARCH NEEDED?
Before a new medicine can be approved, research studies must be done to show that it is safe
and effective. The first step in studying a new medicine is to test it in healthy volunteers, before
testing it in people with the disease the medicine will treat.
Researchers in this study tested a drug called AZD9977 as a possible treatment for chronic kidney
disease. They wanted to compare the effects of different doses of AZD9977 in healthy adult
males. By using an electronic capsule called IntelliCap, researchers also wanted to learn how
AZD9977 was absorbed in the body. IntelliCap releases medicine when researchers want it to and
can also be tracked so researchers know where AZD9977 is in the body at all times.
Researchers wanted to know:
• How does the human body process AZD9977?
• How is AZD9977 absorbed in the body in participants who take it in capsule form
compared to liquid form?
• How safe is AZD9977 to take and what medical problems did participants have?
This study had 70 healthy men between the ages of 20 and 48 years.
WHAT KIND OF STUDY WAS THIS?
Part A of this study was a “single-blind” study. “Single-blind” means that researchers knew
what participants were taking but the participants did not know. Part B of this study was an
“open-label” study. “Open-label” means that both researchers and participants knew what
participants were taking. All participants took either AZD9977 or a placebo. A placebo looks like
a real drug but has no actual medicine in it. Researchers use placebos to make sure the study
drug actually works.
