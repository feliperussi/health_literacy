Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants
in this study were 20 to 53 years old when they joined. Half of the participants
were smokers and half of the participants were non-smokers. The smokers had a
history of smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day for more than 6 months before
they entered the study. The non-smokers had no history of smoking cigarettes.
After being exposed to nicotine, the body makes a chemical called cotinine. The
level of cotinine in a urine sample can be tested as evidence of recent smoking.
In this study, the smokers provided a urine sample that was positive for cotinine
before they entered the study. The non-smokers provided a urine sample that was
negative for cotinine.
The study included 28 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
The study drug, AZD4635, is being developed to treat some types of cancer,
including prostate cancer. Some drugs need to be broken down before they can
be removed from the body. How quickly the drug is broken down affects how
much of it is in the blood. AZD4635 is removed from the body after being broken
down by a liver protein called CYP1A2. Smoking can affect how CYP1A2 works.
CYP1A2 can also be affected by some drugs, like a treatment for depression
called fluvoxamine. Finding out if drugs or behaviours like smoking affect how
much AZD4635 gets into the blood can help researchers learn how people should
take AZD4635.
