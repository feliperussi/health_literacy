Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study treatment called benralizumab.
You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about benralizumab to help
people who have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. The participants in this study had
inflammation of the sinuses, large nasal polyps inside the nose, and symptoms that lasted for
more than 3 months. In this summary, we will refer to this condition as “nasal polyps”. Nasal
polyps are painless soft growths inside the nose and sinuses.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of the
study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped
prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel
proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
study doctor or staff at your study site.
