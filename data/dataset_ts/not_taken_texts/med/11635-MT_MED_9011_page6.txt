The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
twice. For each visit, the participants stayed at the study site for 5 days and took
their study treatment on the second day.
The participants stayed at home for 10 days between each visit to the study site.
During that time, the participants did not take any study treatment. This was
done so that treatment 1 could leave the participantsâ€™ bodies before they took
treatment 2.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
once. This happened up to 10 days after the participants took their last dose
of study treatment. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants.
