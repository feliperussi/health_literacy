Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
dapagliflozin. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about dapagliflozin
to help people who have chronic kidney disease, also called CKD.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants to understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the study doctor or staff at your study site.
