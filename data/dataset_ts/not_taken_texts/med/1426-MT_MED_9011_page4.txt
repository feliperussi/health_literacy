How did durvalumab act in the blood?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the level of durvalumab in the
participants’ blood after the first dose and after multiple doses at “steady state”. Steady
state means the body is absorbing the drug at the same rate the body is removing it.
This was measured in micrograms per milliliter of blood, also called μg/mL.
In general, the researchers found that steady state was reached after about 4 doses in
a row. The highest level of durvalumab in the blood after the first dose was about the
same whether it was given alone or with tremelimumab. At steady state, the highest
level of durvalumab in the blood was higher when it was given alone than when it was
given with tremelimumab.

After the first dose, the researchers found that the level of durvalumab in the blood just
before the next dose was about the same whether it was given alone or with tremelimumab.
At steady state, the level of durvalumab in the blood just before the next dose was higher
when it was given alone than when it was given with tremelimumab.
