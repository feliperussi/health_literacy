What happened during this study?
The study started in October 2020 and ended in December 2020.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks because the participants
joined at different times. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants
could join the study. They also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X did a test for COVID-19
X took blood and urine samples
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
3 times. Each time, they:
X had a breathing tube inserted
X stayed at their study site overnight for 4 nights
X got a different study treatment
Before visiting their study site to get Treatment 3, the participants also took
rabeprazole at home for 2 days.
The participants did not get any treatment for at least 4 days in between visits.
This was done so the study treatment could be “washed out” of their bodies
before they got the next treatment.
Up to 10 days after the participants got their last study treatment,
they visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the
health of the participants.
