Clinical Study Results
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy male participants. Everyone in the
study was between 23 and 50 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the
participants were taking, but the participants did not.
There were 4 groups in the study. The participants in each group were assigned to
take either AZD4831 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have
any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects
they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Each group was given a different dose of AZD4831:
• Group 1 took the lowest dose.
• Group 2 took a high dose.
• Group 3 took the highest dose.
• Group 4 took a low dose. This dose was higher than the Group 1 dose but
lower than the Group 2 dose.
All of the treatments were taken in liquid form by mouth:
• Participants in Group 1 and Group 2 took AZD4831 or a placebo once
a day for 10 days.
• Participants in Group 3 were supposed to take AZD4831 or a placebo once
a day for 10 days.
• Participants in Group 4 took AZD4831 or a placebo once a day for 14 days.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
