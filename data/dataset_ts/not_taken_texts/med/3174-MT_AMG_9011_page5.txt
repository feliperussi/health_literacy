The figure below shows the investigational medicines participants took in Part 2 of the
study:
Part 2 lasted almost 6 months
 Based on the results of Part 1, researchers chose 1 formulation to
test in Part 2.
 Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 doses of omecamtiv
mecarbil or the placebo.
 Participants took their assigned treatment twice a day for 20 weeks
and once on the last day of the study.
 Participants had a 2 in 3 chance (66%) of receiving omecamtiv
mecarbil and a 1 in 3 chance (33%) of receiving the placebo.
o 150 participants took 25 mg omecamtiv mecarbil
o 146 participants started taking 25 mg omecamtiv mecarbil
and could increase their dose to 50 mg after 8 weeks
o 149 participants took the placebo
6. What were the side effects?
What are side effects (sometimes called adverse reactions)?
All medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen
when you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record side effects that
they think may be caused by the investigational medicine each patient is receiving.
These are also called “adverse reactions.” Only side effects that the study doctor thought
may be related to the study treatment a participant was receiving are reported in this
summary.
What side effects related to the treatment (also called “adverse reactions”) were
seen?
When reporting side effects in this study, the study doctor did not know if the participant
was receiving omecamtiv mecarbil or the placebo. A side effect was recorded as
“serious” if it caused death, was life threatening, required the participant to stay in a
hospital, or caused a birth defect. No participant died due to a side effect in either Part 1
or 2 of this study.
