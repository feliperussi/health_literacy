Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. There was up to 1 month between this visit and the participants taking
the study treatment. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants
could join the study. They also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
