Who took part in this trial?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, also called “CLL”. The participants in this trial were 42 to 76 years old
when they joined.
All of the participants had cancer that was getting worse
Roughly half of the participants had already had at least 1 treatment for their
cancer, but it was getting worse.
The other half of the participants had never had any treatment for their cancer,
or were unable to have any other treatment.
This trial included 69 men and women in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat CLL in adults. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to receive, researchers do clinical trials to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
CLL is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells and bone marrow,
which is the spongy material found inside some bones. In CLL, the bone marrow
produces too many white blood cells, which are not fully developed and do
not work properly. Over time, this can cause problems such as a higher risk of
infections, fatigue, unusual bleeding or bruising, and swollen glands in the neck,
armpits, or groin.
Researchers think that the trial drug, acalabrutinib, may be helpful in treating
certain types of cancer when it is given with obinutuzumab, rituximab, or
venetoclax. These drugs are designed to work by stopping the cancer cells from
growing out of control.
