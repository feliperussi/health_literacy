Clinical Study Results
Researchers already did studies that showed dapagliflozin worked for study
participants with type 2 diabetes. In this study, the researchers wanted to find
out more about how dapagliflozin affects body fat levels in participants with
type 2 diabetes who were taking metformin.
When a person has type 2 diabetes, the body cannot control the levels of
sugar in the blood. This can lead to several medical problems. In many cases,
the cause of type 2 diabetes is being overweight or obese. But, few of the
current type 2 diabetes treatments help people to lose body fat and control
body weight.
An approved type 2 diabetes drug, metformin, is commonly used to control
blood sugar and fat levels in the body. But, some type 2 diabetes patients have
to take additional drugs to help control these levels. Two of these approved
drugs that can be used together with metformin are dapagliflozin
and glimepiride.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin affect the fat levels in the body compared to
glimepiride?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women with type 2 diabetes who were already taking metformin. These
men and women had also reported that their blood sugar levels had been too
high or too low within 4 weeks of the start of this study. Everyone in the study
was 26 to 73 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what drugs the participants were taking.
The participants in the study took either:
• dapagliflozin and metformin
• glimepiride and metformin
All of the drugs were taken as a pill by mouth.
