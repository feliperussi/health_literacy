Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic kidney disease, also known as
CKD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Verinurad is being developed as a treatment for CKD. In this study, the researchers
compared 3 different forms of verinurad. They wanted to find out how different forms
affected the amount of verinurad that got into the participants’ blood.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much verinurad got into the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if verinurad improves the health of people with CKD.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the study
was aged 19 to 49 when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew
what the participants were taking.
In this study, all of the participants took 3 different forms of verinurad. These forms were
called ER8, A, and B. Each form was made in a different way, but the participants took
each form as a capsule by mouth. Forms A and B were taken with food or without food
and form ER8 was only taken without food. The dose of verinurad was measured in
milligrams, also known as mg. Each dose was 12 mg.
There were 5 treatment periods in this study, and each treatment period lasted for 5 days.
Each participant completed each treatment period. Each participant waited at least 5 days
between the start of each treatment period.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that each participant took
each treatment. This helps make sure the order is chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
