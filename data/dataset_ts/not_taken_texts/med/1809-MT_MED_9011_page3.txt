Clinical Study Results
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how many participants had dose-
limiting toxicities after getting adavosertib and olaparib. Dose-limiting toxicities are
also called DLTs. These are medical problems that are severe enough to prevent
the study doctor from increasing the dose of the study treatment in the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How many participants had DLTs after getting adavosertib and olaparib?
• Did the participants’ safety results change after taking adavosertib with
olaparib?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if adavosertib taken together with olaparib improves the
health of people with certain cancers.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with solid tumors and men
and women with SCLC. They had already tried treatments but their cancer had
started growing again. Everyone in the study was 26 to 80 years old when they
joined.
