Clinical Study Results
The study drugs, budesonide and albuterol sulfate, are inhaled treatments that
doctors currently use to help people manage their asthma symptoms. Both of these
drugs are used on their own, but they are not available combined in the same
inhaler. Researchers think that taking the 2 drugs together may help people who
have asthma better manage their asthma symptoms.
To learn more about these drugs, the researchers gave the participants 2 inhaled
treatments. One of these treatments was an inhaled drug called Pulmicort, which
contained only budesonide. The other treatment was an inhaled combination
treatment that contained both budesonide and albuterol sulfate.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did the study treatments act in the body?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if budesonide combined with albuterol sulfate improves
the health of people who have asthma.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The
participants in this study were 18 to 55 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking.
In this study, the participants got 2 inhaled treatments:
• Pulmicort, which contained only budesonide
• Budesonide combined with albuterol sulfate
The study doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the
participants took each treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen
fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
