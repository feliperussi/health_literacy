What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant who did not finish getting all of their measurements or
doses of study treatment. So, the results below are for 45 out of 46 participants.
Did benralizumab affect the participants’ allergic responses in their
lungs?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab did affect the participants’
allergic responses in their lungs compared with the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ allergic
responses by triggering a controlled allergic reaction. This is known as an
allergen challenge. This is done in a safe environment with doctors around in
case there are any medical problems.
The participants did an allergen challenge after taking study treatment for 8
weeks. The researchers measured the average number of eosinophil cells in
the participants’ lung mucus. They did this before this allergen challenge and
7 hours after this allergen challenge. The researchers measured the change in
eosinophils as a percentage.
