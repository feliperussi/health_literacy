What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How many participants no longer needed oral corticosteroids to control their
asthma after getting benralizumab?
X Did the participants feel that getting benralizumab while taking a lower dose
of oral corticosteroids or no oral corticosteroids helped them control their
asthma symptoms and helped their quality of life?
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know to find out if benralizumab
helps improve the health of people with severe asthma.
