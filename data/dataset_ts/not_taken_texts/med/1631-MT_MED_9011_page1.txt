Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
osimertinib. AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in September 2018. The study included
16 participants in France, the Republic of Korea, and Spain.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
