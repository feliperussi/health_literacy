The researchers also studied the amount of time the participants lived after they started
treatment. The researchers measured this by using the “median” number of months the
participants lived after starting the study. A median is the middle number in a set of numbers. It is
between the lowest and highest numbers.
The researchers found that overall:
• The participants in Group 1 lived for a median of 6.5 months after starting the study.
• The participants in Group 2 lived for a median of 7.6 months after starting the study.
• The participants in Group 3 lived for a median of 8.3 months after starting the study.
