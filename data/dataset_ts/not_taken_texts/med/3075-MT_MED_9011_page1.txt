What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 6 weeks. But, the entire study took
about 5 months to finish.
The study started in April 2017 and ended in September 2017. The sponsor reviewed
the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a
summary of that report.
