Clinical Trial Results
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
researchers, or staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting can affect the
results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly.
In this study, participants got either MEDI9929 or the placebo.
Your study included men and women with moderate or severe AD who were 18 to 71
years old.
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for about 6 months.
To see if you could join the study, study doctors did a physical examination by checking
your height, weight, and temperature. Study doctors took blood and urine samples
and checked your heart health using an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Study doctors also
checked your skin for AD symptoms and asked about your medical history, how you
were feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
If you are female, you had a blood test to make sure you were not pregnant.
Before and during the study, study doctors used a scoring system to look at how
severe participants’ AD symptoms were. A higher score meant the AD symptoms were
more severe.
Once you joined the study, you began using a steroid cream on your skin for 2 weeks.
After 2 weeks, you were randomly assigned to get either MEDI9929 or the placebo. All
participants in the trial had the same chance of getting the study drug or the placebo.
Out of the original 113 participants, 111 participants got treatment - 55 got MEDI9929
and 56 got the placebo. Some participants left the study before it was completed.
MEDI9929 or the placebo was injected under the skin every 2 weeks for a total of
10 weeks. In addition to MEDI9929 or the placebo, all participants continued to use
the steroid cream on their skin throughout the study.
