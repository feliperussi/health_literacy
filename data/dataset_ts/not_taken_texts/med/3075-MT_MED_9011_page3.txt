Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the participants visited their study site 2 times so that the
doctors could:
• check their health to make sure they could join the study
• take blood and urine samples
• check their heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG
During the study, the participants visited their study site 2 more times. During the first
of these 2 visits, the participants stayed at their study site for 7 days. On the first day,
they took 1 of the 3 inhaler treatments once a day. For the next 6 days, they took their
inhaler treatment twice a day.
During these 7 days, the participants took 1 of the below treatments:
• the inhaler treatment that had a lower dose of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate
• the inhaler treatment that had a higher dose of budesonide, glycopyrronium,
and formoterol fumarate
• the inhaler treatment that had only glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate
After the 7-day visit ended, the participants stayed at the study site 1 more day to
take 1 more dose of the inhaler treatment. The doctors also checked the health of the
participants again.
About 1 week after this last visit, the doctors called the participants to ask them about
their health.
