Clinical Study Results
This was also a “crossover” study. This means that each participant got both of the study
treatments, but they took them in a different order. All the participants took tablets once a
day for 7 days. The doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
The 2 study treatments were:
• 9 mg RDEA3170, 80 mg febuxostat, and 10 mg dapagliflozin
• 9 mg RDEA3170, 80 mg febuxostat, and a placebo
The placebo looked like dapagliflozin but did not have any medicine in it. Researchers
use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in participants who take
a treatment are actually caused by the treatment. A computer program was used to
randomly choose the order that participants took each treatment. This helps make sure
the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the doctors checked the overall health of the participants to
make sure that they could join the study. The doctors checked the heart health of the
participants using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG, and took blood and
urine samples.
During the study, there were 2 parts. In both parts, the participants took their assigned
treatment. They also gave blood and urine samples at each study visit.
In Part 1, the participants:
• stayed overnight at the study center for the first 2 nights
• took study treatments at home for the next 5 days
• stayed overnight at the study center for the last 2 nights
The participants waited 1 to 3 weeks before returning to the study center for Part 2.
This was done so that all of the study treatment from Part 1 could leave the participants’
bodies before they started Part 2.
In Part 2, the participants:
• stayed overnight at the study center for the first 2 nights
• took study treatments at home for the next 5 days
• stayed overnight at the study center for the last 2 nights
