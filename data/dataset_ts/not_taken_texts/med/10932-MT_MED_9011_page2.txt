Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have asthma. Before
a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
Asthma is a condition that causes a person’s airways to narrow, swell, and create
extra mucus. This can lead to several symptoms, including chest pain, coughing,
and difficulty breathing. Currently, there is no cure for asthma.
Budesonide and albuterol sulfate are 2 inhaler treatments that doctors currently
use to help asthma patients control their symptoms. Both of these drugs are used
on their own, but they are not available combined in the same inhaler. Researchers
think that taking the 2 drugs combined in the same inhaler may help asthma
patients better control their asthma.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did budesonide and albuterol sulfate act differently in the body when taken
together?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if budesonide and albuterol sulfate taken together improve
the health of asthma patients.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 19 to 55 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew which treatment the participant was taking.
There were 3 treatments in this study, which were all taken through an inhaler. All
of the participants took all 3 treatments, but in a different order:
• inhaler treatment of budesonide only
• inhaler treatment of albuterol sulfate only
• combined inhaler treatment of budesonide and albuterol sulfate
