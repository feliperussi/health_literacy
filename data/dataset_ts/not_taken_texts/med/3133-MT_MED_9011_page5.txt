What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got either AZD9150 alone or AZD9150 with
durvalumab. Both study treatments were given through a needle into a vein,
also known as an IV infusion. The doses were measured in milligrams, also known
as mg.
This study was “open-label”. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
There were 2 groups in this study. At the beginning of the study, the participants
in both groups stayed overnight at their study site for 1 week to get 3 separate
doses of AZD9150. After the first week:
> The participants in Group 1 got an infusion of AZD9150 every week.
> The participants in Group 2 got an infusion of AZD9150 every week and an
infusion of durvalumab every 4 weeks.
The participants continued getting study treatment for as long as the study
doctors thought it was helping them, or until they left the study.
The table below shows the treatments that the participants got.
