Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart failure. Before a treatment
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as well
as it should. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and make the heart
change shape. It can also cause fluid to build up in the arms and legs. There are
treatments for heart failure, but some of these treatments can increase the amount
of potassium in the blood. High potassium levels may also develop in people with
kidney disease.
People with high levels of potassium in their blood often do not have any
symptoms that can be detected. But, they may have problems with their
heartbeat. This can be dangerous and in rare cases, can lead to death.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD9977 increased the
participantsâ€™ blood potassium levels less than a drug for heart failure called
spironolactone.
