Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
There was 1 participant who was planned to get acalabrutinib and BSC, but
this participant did not get any acalabrutinib. So, the results below show this
participant as part of the group who got BSC only.

Did acalabrutinib when added to BSC help the participants stay alive
and breathe without help?
No. Overall, the researchers found that acalabrutinib when added to BSC did not
help the participants stay alive and breathe without help.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of participants who
were alive and could breathe without help 4 weeks after the study started. They
did this for each treatment group. The researchers calculated these numbers as a
percentage. Then, they compared the results in the group who got acalabrutinib
and BSC to the results in the group who got BSC only.
