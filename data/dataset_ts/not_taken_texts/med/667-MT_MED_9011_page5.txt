What happened during this study?
The study started in December 2016 and ended in December 2020. This summary
includes the study results as of August 2019.
Before the participants took study treatment, the study doctors did genetic
tests on their blood samples and tumor samples. This was done to find out if
the participants had mutations in common cancer genes called “BRCA1” and
“BRCA2”. The BRCA mutations that were found in the blood samples could be
inherited mutations, also called “germline” mutations. Or they could be mutations
in their tumor cells, also called “somatic” mutations or “acquired” mutations.
The study doctors also tested the tumor samples to see if the cancer cells had
gene mutations that make it difficult for the cells to repair themselves when they
are damaged. This reduced ability is also called homologous recombination
deficiency also known as “HRD”.
Based on the results of these tests, the participants were placed into 1 of the
following 5 groups:
X Group 1: Participants with an inherited mutation in their BRCA1 or BRCA2
genes
X Group 2: Participants with an acquired mutation in their tumor BRCA1 or
BRCA2 genes, and normal inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
X Group 3: Participants with tumor-cell HRD and normal BRCA1 and BRCA2
genes
X Group 4: Participants without tumor-cell HRD and with normal BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes
X Group 5: Participants with missing or unavailable information on their
tumor-cell HRD and/or BRCA gene mutations
The participants were in the study until one of the following happened:
X the participant chose to stop taking part
X the participant died
X the study team could not contact the participant
