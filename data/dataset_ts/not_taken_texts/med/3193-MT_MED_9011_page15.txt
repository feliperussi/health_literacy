How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how benralizumab works and
about its safety in participants with severe asthma.
Overall, 62.9% of participants no longer needed daily oral corticosteroids to
control their asthma after getting benralizumab. There were also 81.9% of
participants who either no longer needed oral corticosteroids to control their
asthma or only needed oral corticosteroids to control other conditions besides
asthma after getting benralizumab. The participants felt that getting benralizumab
while taking a lower dose of oral corticosteroids or no oral corticosteroids helped
them control their asthma symptoms and improved their quality of life.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with benralizumab are planned.
