Did the participants who took the MEDI3250 vaccine have more or fewer
symptoms compared to the participants who took the placebo?
In general, the participants who took the MEDI3250 vaccine had slightly more
symptoms compared to the participants who took the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers studied:
• the number of participants who developed a fever of 101°F or higher
within 1 week of taking the MEDI3250 vaccine or placebo
• the number of participants who developed symptoms within 1 week
of taking the MEDI3250 vaccine or placebo
• the number of participants who developed symptoms within 2 weeks
of taking the MEDI3250 vaccine or placebo
Within 1 week of taking the MEDI3250 vaccine or placebo, the researchers
found that:
• None of the participants in either group developed a fever of 101°F
or higher.
• 27.9% of participants who took the MEDI3250 vaccine developed symptoms.
This was 67 out of 240 participants.
• 26.7% of participants who took the placebo developed symptoms. This was
16 out of 60 participants.
