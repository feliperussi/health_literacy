Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So,
when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that
participants have during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”.
They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
Out of the 87 participants in the study, researchers had information about medical
problems from 86 participants. The missing information was because one participant
was assigned to take 10 mg of ticagrelor but did not have at least four days of pain
during the first four weeks when everyone took the placebo.
How many participants had medical problems in the study?
About the same number of participants in each treatment group had medical problems
in the study. One participant in the 45 mg ticagrelor group and one participant in the
placebo group stopped taking the study drug because of medical problems. The table
below shows how many participants in each treatment group had medical problems.
