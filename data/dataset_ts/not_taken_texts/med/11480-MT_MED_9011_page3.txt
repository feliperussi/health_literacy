Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with type 2 diabetes. The
participants in this study were 50 to 75 years old when they joined.
The participants could join the study if they were:
X diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 6 months before they joined the
study
X taking a type of treatment called metformin for at least 4 weeks before
joining the study
The study included 46 participants in Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have type 2
diabetes who also need to take drugs to reduce inflammation in their body.
Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much glucose is released
into the blood after a meal with AZD9567 compared to prednisolene in a small
number of participants with type 2 diabetes. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Type 2 diabetes can be caused by treatment for inflammatory diseases. In
people with inflammatory diseases, type 2 diabetes occurs by mistake.
Inflammatory diseases can be treated with a type of drug called “steroids”.
Steroids are designed to decrease the activity of the immune system by
reducing inflammation in the body. Prednisolone is a type of steroid.
But, when steroids are taken for a long time, they can cause “blood glucose
levels” to rise higher than normal levels. Blood glucose levels show the amount
of sugar in the blood. Increases in blood glucose levels can cause medical
problems, such as type 2 diabetes, or make it worse for people who already
have type 2 diabetes. Researchers are trying to find treatments that help reduce
inflammation without increasing blood glucose levels.
