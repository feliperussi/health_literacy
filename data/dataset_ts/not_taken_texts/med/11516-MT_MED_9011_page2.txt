Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of patients with COVID-19 who were already in
the hospital.
The study included 9 patients in Brazil.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to treat the coronavirus disease known as
“COVID-19”. Before a treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can cause swelling in the airways and
lungs. This can lead to lung damage, difficulty breathing, and other medical
problems. If the swelling is severe, people who have COVID-19 may have a
breathing tube inserted and may not be able to swallow a pill. They may also have
increased stomach acid while they have a breathing tube in.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of cancer. But in
animal studies, researchers have found that acalabrutinib may also reduce swelling
in the lungs. Based on the results from these animal studies, researchers thought
that acalabrutinib might be able to decrease swelling in the lungs and airways in
people who have COVID-19.
Acalabrutinib is already available as a capsule and tablet taken by mouth. Because
patients who have COVID-19 may have a breathing tube inserted, it may be
harder for them to swallow a capsule or tablet. In these cases, it may be helpful to
give acalabrutinib by a “nasogastric tube”, which is a tube that goes through the
nose to the stomach.
Patients who have a breathing tube are often given antacids known as “proton
pump inhibitors” to reduce stomach acid and prevent ulcers. Earlier studies in
healthy people have shown that when there is less stomach acid, it is harder for
acalabrutinib to get into the blood when given as a capsule.
