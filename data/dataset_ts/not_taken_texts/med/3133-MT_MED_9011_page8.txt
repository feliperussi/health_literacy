Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
Groups 1 and 2
(out of 11 participants)
How many participants had adverse events? 90.9% (10)
How many participants had serious adverse events? 9.1% (1)
How many participants stopped taking study treatment
9.1% (1)
because of adverse events?
The serious adverse event was inflammation of the pancreas.
The most common adverse events were:
> Decreased numbers of blood cells that help form blood clots
> Liver not working normally
> Feeling generally unwell
> Fever
> Increased levels of the liver proteins called AST, ALT, and GGT
> Decreased numbers of a type of white blood cell called neutrophils
> Decreased appetite
> Nausea
The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities the
participants had during the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is an adverse event that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participantâ€™s dose of
study treatment. A dose-limiting toxicity is also known as a DLT.
There was 9.1% of participants who had a DLT during the study. This was 1 out of
11 participants.
