Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So,
researchers keep track of all of the medical problems that participants have during a
study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be
caused by the study drug.
The medical problems listed below happened up to and including Day 29 of this study.
Day 29 was the fourth visit during this study.
How many participants developed medical problems during this study?
By Day 29 of this study, 287 out of 1894 participants (15.2%) developed medical
problems. The table below shows the number of medical problems that occurred
by Day 29 of this study.
MEDI7510 and flu vaccine Placebo and flu vaccine
(out of 946 participants) (out of 948 participants)
How many participants
developed medical problems 146 (15.4%) 141 (14.9%)
by Day 29?
How many participants developed serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or needs hospitalization.
By Day 29 of this study:
• 4 out of 946 participants (0.4%) who got MEDI7510 and the flu vaccine
developed serious medical problems
• 3 out of 948 participants (0.3%) who got the placebo and the flu vaccine
developed serious medical problems
At the end of this study:
• 3 out of 946 participants (0.3%) who got MEDI7510 and the flu vaccine died
• 5 out of 948 participants (0.5%) who got the placebo and the flu vaccine died
The researchers did not think that any of the serious medical problems or deaths in
this study were related to the study treatments.
