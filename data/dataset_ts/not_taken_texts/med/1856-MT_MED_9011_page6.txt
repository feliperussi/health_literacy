Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had
might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor
before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study results.
Did the participants’ safety results change after taking MEDI9197?
To help answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and
measurements that the study doctors took before and after the participants received study
treatment. They found that there were no significant changes in the results of the participants’
blood and urine tests or ECGs. They found that there was not enough information about the
participants’ changes in vital signs to make a conclusion.
The researchers also collected information about the “adverse events” the participants had. An
adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study. Doctors keep track
of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events
might be related to the study treatments.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study treatment. This section is a summary of all the adverse
events, whether they might be related to the trial treatment or not. An adverse event is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the trial. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
