Clinical Study Results
How did dapagliflozin and saxagliptin affect the HbA1c levels of the
participants?
In general, after 24 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that the participants who
took both dapagliflozin and saxagliptin together with metformin had the largest decrease
in their HbA1c levels.
The participants who took dapagliflozin and the placebo with metformin had a similar
decrease in their HbA1c levels compared to the participants who took saxagliptin and the
placebo with metformin.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the HbA1c levels of the participants
throughout the study.
After 24 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that on average:
• the participants who took all 3 drugs had a 1.0% decrease in their HbA1c levels
• the participants who took dapagliflozin and the placebo with metformin had
a 0.6% decrease in their HbA1c levels
• the participants who took saxagliptin and the placebo with metformin had
a 0.7% decrease in their HbA1c levels
The figure below shows these results.
