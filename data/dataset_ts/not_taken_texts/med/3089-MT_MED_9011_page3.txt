Who took part in this trial?
The researchers asked for the help of people with advanced breast cancer. The
participants in this trial were 22 to 75 years old when they joined.
All of the participants had a change in either of 2 genes called “BRCA1” or
“BRCA2”. The participants’ cancer was also classified as “HER2-ve”. More
details about this specific type of breast cancer can be found in the “Why was
this research needed?” section.
Participants had also previously received either of 2 specific chemotherapy
drugs called anthracycline and taxane, and their cancer had gotten worse after
treatment with either of these 2 chemotherapy drugs.
This trial included 4 males and 251 females in 15 countries:

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced breast cancer. Before
a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical trials to find
out how it works and how safe it is.
In people with breast cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cancer
cells in the breast. These cancer cells can form tumors in the breast and can also
spread to other parts of the body. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of
the body, this is called “metastatic” breast cancer, or “advanced” breast cancer.
