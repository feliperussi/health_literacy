Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with advanced solid tumors.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. “Advanced” usually
means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or has grown beyond
the organ where it started. Adavosertib is being developed as a possible treatment for
advanced solid tumors.
People with advanced solid tumors often take many different treatments at the same
time. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if taking adavosertib affected the
levels of 3 substances in the blood. They also wanted to learn if adavosertib affected
the heart.
The 3 substances were caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam. Caffeine is found in some
foods and drinks. Omeprazole is used to treat conditions such as indigestion, heartburn,
and acid reflux. Midazolam is used to treat epilepsy and some psychological conditions.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam was in the participants’ blood when
they were taken with adavosertib?
• Did adavosertib affect the length of time of the participants’ heartbeats?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if adavosertib improves the health of people with advanced solid tumors.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid tumors.
These participants had tried other treatments, but their tumors were getting worse and
there were no other treatments available. The participants were between 41 and 83 years
old when they joined the study.
