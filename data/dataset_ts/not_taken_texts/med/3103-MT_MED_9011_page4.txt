Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study results.
Did the participants’ safety results change after taking adavosertib?
To answer this question, the doctors compared the results of the tests and measurements
that they took before and after the participants took adavosertib.
The researchers found that there were no significant changes in the results of the blood
or urine tests, vital signs, or ECG tests done throughout the study.
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had. An adverse
event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of
all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events
might be related to the study drug.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the doctors
thought might be related to the study drug. This section is a summary of all the adverse
events, whether they might be related to the study drug or not.
An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or the participant requires hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is needed
to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
