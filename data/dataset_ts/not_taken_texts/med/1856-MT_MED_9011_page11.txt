How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn about the safety of MEDI9197 and if the drug could help
participants with advanced cancer that was no longer responding to standard treatment.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with MEDI9197 are not planned.
