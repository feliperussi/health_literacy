Clinical Study Results
What is happening with the study now?
The participants could each have been in the study for about 3 years, but the entire
study took over 4 years to finish. The study started in August 2015 and finished in
September 2019.
This study included a total of 444 participants in the Czech Republic, Germany,
Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
