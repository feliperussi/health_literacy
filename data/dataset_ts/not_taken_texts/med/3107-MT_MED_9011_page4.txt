Did the patch reduce injection site pain in participants as well as the approved patch?
In general, the researchers found that the study patch reduced the participants’ average
injection site pain in a similar amount compared to the approved patch.
To answer this question, the researchers asked the participants to rate their injection
site pain after each injection. Participants rated their pain on a scale from 0 to 100. Zero
meant no injection site pain, and 100 meant the highest amount of injection site pain.
When the participants got the study patch and the approved patch treatment:
• on average, the participants rated their pain as an 8.8 after getting the study patch
• on average, the participants rated their pain as a 10.4 after getting the approved patch
When the participants got the study patch and the placebo patch treatment:
• on average, the participants rated their pain as an 8.1 after getting the study patch
• on average, the participants rated their pain as a 22.2 after getting the placebo patch
