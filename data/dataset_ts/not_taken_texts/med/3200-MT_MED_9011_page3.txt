Clinical Study Results
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

How did omega-3 carboxylic acids act in the blood?
Omega-3 carboxylic acids is a mixture of several kinds of carboxylic acids. The
researchers studied 2 of the carboxylic acids that make up the largest parts of the
mixture. One is eicosapentaenoic acid, also called EPA. The other is docosahexaenoic
acid, also called DHA.
The researchers measured the levels of EPA and DHA in the blood of participants
before and at different times after they took omega-3 carboxylic acids. This helped the
researchers find:
• the highest levels of EPA and DHA in the blood
• the total amounts of EPA and DHA in the blood over 24 hours
• how long it took for EPA and DHA to reach their highest levels in the blood
Highest levels of EPA and DHA in the blood
For both EPA and DHA, the highest levels in the participants’ blood after they took 1
dose of omega-3 carboxylic acids every day for 14 days were about 3 times the highest
levels after they took 1 dose of omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day.
The chart below shows the highest levels of EPA and DHA in the blood after taking
omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day and for 14 days. These levels are measured in
micrograms per milliliter of blood, also called μg/mL.
