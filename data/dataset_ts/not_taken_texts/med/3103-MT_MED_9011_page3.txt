Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took the study drug, they visited the study site 1 time. This
was up to 14 days before they started the study. At this visit, the doctors checked the
participants’ overall health to make sure that they could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood samples
• checked each participant’s heart using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• asked about the participants’ health and medications
During the first 2 treatment cycles, the participants took adavosertib at home.
The participants visited the study site 2 times and had 8 telephone calls with the study
doctors.
After the first 2 treatment cycles, the participants took adavosertib at home. They
visited the study site 1 time in each cycle.
At each site visit, the doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked the participants’ health
• took blood and urine samples
• checked each participant’s heart using an ECG
• asked about the participants’ health and medications
The participants could keep taking adavosertib as long as the study doctors thought it
was helping their cancer.
About 30 days after the participants took their last dose, the doctors called them
to ask about their overall health and if they were having any medical problems.
