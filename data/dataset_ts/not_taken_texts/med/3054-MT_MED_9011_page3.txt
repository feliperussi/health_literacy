Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with severe asthma. The
participants in this study were 18 to 74 years old when they joined. All of the
participants had tried other treatments that are already available to treat asthma,
but they were still having uncontrolled symptoms of asthma. This included a type
of treatment called corticosteroids.
The study included 660 participants in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a drug can
be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab worked in a large
number of participants with severe asthma that is not controlled well with already
available treatments. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow and causes
inflammation in the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have
asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
Inflammation in the lungs is linked to high levels of white blood cells called
eosinophils in the lungs. Benralizumab works by reducing the number of
eosinophils, which researchers believe can help control asthma symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab affected the
number of asthma attacks, also known as “exacerbations”, that the participants
would have experienced over 1 year.
