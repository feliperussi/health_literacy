Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think
might be related to the study drugs are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study
drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary because
there was a small number of participants in the study. Leaving this information out helps
protect their identities. The website listed at the end of this summary may have other
information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how a 3-drug treatment and the 2-drug treatment
acted in the body.
The results presented here are for a single study. Researchers look at the results of
many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may
provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any
treatment changes.
Further clinical studies with the inhaler combination of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate are planned.
