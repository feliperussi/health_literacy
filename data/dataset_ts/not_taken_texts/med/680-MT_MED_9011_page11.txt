Health-related quality of life
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took olaparib reported
that it helped their health-related quality of life compared with the NHA
treatments.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete a
questionnaire called the “Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate”,
also known as FACT-P. Based on the participants’ responses in this questionnaire,
the study doctors calculated a FACT-P score for each participant. The researchers
calculated the average change in this score throughout the study. They compared
these results in the participants who took olaparib and in those who took the NHA
treatments. A smaller change in the FACT-P score meant that the participants’
health-related quality of life was better.
The researchers found that the average change in the FACT-P score was a:
> 6.2 point decrease for the participants who took olaparib
> 12.4 point decrease for the participants who took the NHA treatments
