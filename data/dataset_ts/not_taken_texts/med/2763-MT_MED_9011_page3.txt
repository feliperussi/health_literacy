Clinical Trial RESULTS
WHAT KIND OF STUDY WAS THIS?
This was an “open-label” study. This means that the participants and the study staff
knew what study drug each participant took.
All participants in each of the 2 groups took the same amount of the study drug in
tablets and capsules, but in a different order. The order of the study drugs was assigned
to each participant by chance, like the tossing of a coin.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
Participants stayed at 1 clinical research unit in the US for up to 22 days. Before
starting this study, study doctors asked about each man’s medical history, did a
physical exam and other tests, and took blood and urine samples to make sure each
man could participate.
During the study, study doctors checked participants’ blood pressure, heart rate, and
temperature; took blood and urine samples; and asked questions about how they were
feeling. Blood samples were collected to measure the amount of RDEA3170 and uric
acid in the blood.
2 Study Groups
Study doctors put participants into 1 of 2 groups. Before some doses, participants had
to fast overnight. This meant they could not eat or drink anything for 10 hours before
taking the study drug.
Group 1: 20 participants in Group 1 stayed in the clinical research unit for 22 days.
Each participant took 1 dose of RDEA3170 every 5 days, for a total of 5 doses.
Four of the doses of RDEA3170 were capsules:
• 5 mg after fasting overnight
• 5 mg after a high-fat, high-calorie meal
• 10 mg after fasting overnight
• 10 mg after a high-fat, high-calorie meal
The fifth dose was 10 mg of RDEA3170 in 4 tablets of 2.5 mg after fasting overnight.
