Did durvalumab together with tremelimumab help the participants live
longer compared with standard treatment?
The researchers tried to answer this question by studying both the Global group
and the China group.
In the Global group:
No. The researchers found that there were some differences in how long
the participants lived when comparing the durvalumab and tremelimumab
combined treatment with the standard treatment. But, the difference between
the 2 treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if durvalumab
together with tremelimumab helped the participants live longer.
To answer this question, the researchers measured how long the participants
lived after they started the study. The researchers looked at data collected until
June 2019. Then, they calculated the average number of months the participants
lived during this period.
The researchers were most interested in studying treatment in a group of
participants who had a specific type of tumor. The researchers thought
that participants with this type of tumor might benefit from treatment more than
others. There were 129 participants with this type of tumor. The results below
are for 69 participants who got durvalumab together with tremelimumab and
60 participants who got the standard treatment.
The researchers found that these participants lived an average of:
X 11.7 months after getting durvalumab together with tremelimumab
X 9.1 months after getting the standard treatment
The researchers also studied how long all of the participants from the
Global group lived after getting durvalumab with tremelimumab or the
standard treatment. They studied this in 410 participants who got durvalumab
together with tremelimumab and 413 participants who got the standard
treatment.
The researchers found that these participants lived an average of:
X 10.9 months after getting durvalumab together with tremelimumab
X 12.1 months after getting the standard treatment
