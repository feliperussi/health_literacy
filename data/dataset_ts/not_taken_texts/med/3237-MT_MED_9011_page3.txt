Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were getting. In this study, all of the participants got
AZD4635. Each dose was 50 milligrams, also known as mg.
This study happened in 2 parts, and each part had different treatment periods. It
was planned that all participants would complete both parts.
The chart below shows the treatments in each period.
Part 1
Treatment Period A 1 dose of AZD4635 as a liquid after fasting
Treatment Period B 1 dose of AZD4635 as a capsule after fasting
Part 2
Treatment Period C 1 dose of AZD4635 as a capsule after breakfast
Treatment Period D 1 dose of AZD4635 as a capsule after fasting
2 daily doses of a drug called lansoprazole for 4 days
before taking AZD4635, and 1 dose 2 hours before
taking AZD4635
Treatment Period E 1 dose of a different form of AZD4635 as a capsule
after fasting
1 “tracer” injection into a vein, also called an
intravenous or IV infusion, to allow the researchers to
see how the treatment moves through the body
