Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the
results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
treatment participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants took SZC or a placebo.
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use
a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
SZC and the placebo were each taken by mouth, as a powder mixed with water.
The doses of SZC were each 10 grams.
All the participants also got insulin and glucose through a needle into their vein,
also called IV infusion. Each dose of insulin was measured at 0.1 units per
kilogram of body weight. Each dose of glucose was 25 grams.
A computer program was used to randomly choose whether the participants
took SZC or the placebo. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible. There were 33 participants chosen to take SZC, and 37 participants
chosen to take the placebo.
