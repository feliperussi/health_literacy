Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think might be
related to the study drugs are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A
lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary. Because there was
a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
The website listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the adverse
reactions that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
These results helped researchers learn how dapagliflozin combined with insulin acts in patients
with type 1 diabetes, how the combination affects the body, and if dapagliflozin is safe to take
with insulin.
The results presented here are for a single study. Researchers look at the results of many
studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the
main results from this 1 study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
