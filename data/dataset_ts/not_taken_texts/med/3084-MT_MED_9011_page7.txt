Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ weight?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got MEDI0382 had a greater
decrease in their weight compared to the participants who got the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers checked the participants’ weight before treatment and
throughout the study. Then, they used a percentage to calculate the LS mean change in weight
after 14 weeks of treatment.
The researchers compared the results for the participants who got MEDI0382 to the results for
the participants who got the placebo. The results for the participants who got liraglutide are also
presented below, but those results were not the main focus of the study.
Overall, the researchers found that after 14 weeks of treatment:
• The participants who got 100 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their weight of 2.70%.
• The participants who got 200 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their weight of 3.47%.
• The participants who got 300 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their weight of 4.33%.
• The participants who got 1.8 mg of liraglutide had an LS mean decrease in their weight of 3.40%.
• The participants who got the placebo had an LS mean decrease in their weight of 0.70%.
The figure below shows these results.
