Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with type 2 diabetes, also
called T2DM. The participants in this study were 36 to 65 years old when they
joined.
The study included 88 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who are at risk of having
heart problems due to heart and blood vessel disease. This is also known as
cardiovascular disease. This is usually caused by inflammation and high levels of fat in
the blood.
The study treatment, MEDI6570, was designed to reduce inflammation. This is the
first time MEDI6570 has been studied in people, so the researchers wanted to find
out about the safety of MEDI6570 in healthy participants. But, healthy people usually
do not have high enough levels of inflammation to be studied. So, the researchers
asked for participants with T2DM who were otherwise healthy to join the study.
