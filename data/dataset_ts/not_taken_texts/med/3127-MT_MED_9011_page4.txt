Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe nasal polyps. In this
study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab works in a large number
of participants with severe nasal polyps. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Nasal polyps are soft growths inside the nose. They often develop in people who
have long-lasting inflammation inside the nose and sinuses. The sinuses are the air
spaces behind the cheek bones and forehead. They connect to the inside of the
nose.
Common symptoms of nasal polyps include a blocked nose, a runny nose, a
feeling of pressure in the face, and a reduced sense of smell.
Steroid pills or steroid nasal sprays are often used to treat nasal polyps. These
help to reduce the long-lasting inflammation in the nose but do not always make
the nasal polyps smaller. So, researchers are looking for other ways to treat nasal
polyps.
Inflammation is caused by the immune system reacting to something the
body does not recognize. In people with severe nasal polyps and long-lasting
inflammation in the nose, two types of white blood cells in the body called
“eosinophils” and “basophils” become too active. Eosinophils and basophils are
involved in inflammation in the air passages in the nose. Researchers think that
benralizumab can help the body reduce the number of these cells.
Benralizumab is currently available as a treatment for some patients with asthma.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab could help to
shrink nasal polyps and help improve nasal polyp symptoms.
