Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the study doctors did tests and exams to check the participants’
health to make sure they could join the study. They also checked the participants’
tumors.
During treatment, the participants joined 1 of 10 groups. Each group got
treatment in 2-week or 3-week periods called “cycles”. The participants could
take part in as many treatment cycles as they wanted until their cancer got
worse. If their cancer got worse, the participants stopped the treatment cycles.
The table below shows the treatment schedule for each group:
