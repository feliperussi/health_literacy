Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took the study treatment, they visited the study site 1 time
so the doctors could get information about their medical history. Then, they visited the site
again. At this visit, the doctors:
• checked the overall health of the participants to make sure that they could join the
study
• took blood samples to check the participants’ blood potassium levels
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an
ECG
These tests were done at the same visit that the participants started taking the study
treatment.
During Part 1, the participants visited the study site up to 4 days in a row. At each visit,
the participants took ZS 1 time. The participants could take the 2 other doses at home
later that day. The doctors checked the participants’ blood potassium levels, heart health,
and overall health at every visit.
Any participants who had normal blood potassium levels could start Part 2 of the study
right away, even if they had not had the full 3 days of treatment.
During Part 2, the participants visited the study site 18 times. At these visits, the doctors
checked the participants’ blood potassium levels, their overall health, their heart health,
and took blood and urine samples.
About 7 days after taking the last dose of ZS, the participants visited the study site
1 more time. At this visit, the doctors checked their blood potassium levels, their overall
health, and their heart health, and took blood and urine samples.
