Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to make sure people with heart failure
who have, or are likely to have, high blood potassium levels can take target doses
of some medications called RAAS inhibitors. The “target dose” is the dose of
an RAAS inhibitor that many doctors think will have the most benefit in treating
that person’s heart failure. Before a drug can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took SZC or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it.
The researchers could not continue the study as planned during the COVID-19
pandemic, so the study closed early and did not include as many participants as
they had expected.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did SZC affect how many participants could take RAAS inhibitors
without having blood potassium levels that were too high?
No. The researchers found that the differences between the participants who
took SZC and those who took the placebo were small.
• What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 6.1% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug or to the placebo during
the study. The most common medical problems were heart failure and
constipation.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
