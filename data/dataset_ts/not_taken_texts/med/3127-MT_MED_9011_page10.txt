The participants also answered a question about their daily nasal polyp symptoms
and how they impacted their quality of life. They kept track of their answers in an
electronic diary. The participants rated how blocked their nose had been in the
last 24 hours with a score of 0 to 3. A score of 0 meant no blockage and a score of
3 meant severe blockage. This is called the “nasal blockage score”, also known as
NBS.
The researchers compared the participants’ NBS at the start of the study to their
NBS after 40 weeks of treatment. The researchers then calculated the average
change in NBS in the participants who got benralizumab and in those who got the
placebo.
X decreased by 0.7 points in the participants who got benralizumab
X decreased by 0.4 points in the participants who got the placebo
The graph below shows these results.
