Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Up to 28 days before the participants took the study drug, they visited the
study site once. The study doctors checked the overall health of the participants to
make sure that they could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history and any medications they were
taking
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked about the participants’ symptoms
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were taking the study drug, they visited their study site
during each of the 4 treatment periods. They took 1 dose of olaparib on the first
day and stayed overnight for the first night of each treatment period. At the end of
each treatment period, the participants started the next treatment period right away.
The chart below shows what happened during each treatment period.

After the participants finished taking all of the doses, they visited their study
site 1 time. This was 7 days after their last dose. After this visit, some participants
could keep taking olaparib if the study doctors thought it was helping them. The
rest of the participants visited their study site 1 more time, up to 30 days after their
last dose.
