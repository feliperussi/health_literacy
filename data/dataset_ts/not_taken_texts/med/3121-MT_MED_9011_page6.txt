Did dapagliflozin work at least as well as acarbose to lower the levels
of HbA1c?
To answer this question, the researchers planned to compare the participantsâ€™
HbA1c levels before taking dapagliflozin or acarbose, and after 24 weeks of
taking dapagliflozin or acarbose. But, the study was ended early by the sponsor.
Because of this, the researchers could not answer this question. The reason the
study was ended early was not related to safety problems.
