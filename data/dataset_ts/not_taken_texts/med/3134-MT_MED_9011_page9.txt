Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped their quality of life or
helped them to control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got tezepelumab felt
that study treatment helped their quality of life and their asthma more than those
who got the placebo.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to answer
some questionnaires about their quality of life and their asthma symptoms. The
participants answered these questionnaires at the beginning of the study and
while they got the study treatment. Some of these questionnaires were:
> Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older,
also called AQLQ(S)+12
> Asthma Control Questionnaire-6, also called ACQ-6
> European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Questionnaire, also called
EQ-5D-5L
> Asthma Symptom Diary, also called the ASD
> Average number of nighttime awakenings per week reported by participants
AQLQ(S)+12
The participants responded to each question on the AQLQ(S)+12 on a scale from
1 to 7. Then, the researchers calculated average scores. A high average score
meant that the participant’s asthma was not affecting their quality of life. A low
average score meant that asthma was severely affecting their quality of life.
The researchers compared the change in scores before treatment to after
48 weeks of treatment. They compared the average change in score for the
participants who got tezepelumab to those who got the placebo. An increase in
average score meant that the participants felt that the study treatment helped
their quality of life.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average AQLQ(S)+12 scores
was:
> an increase of 0.94 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> an increase of 0.58 for the participants who got the placebo
