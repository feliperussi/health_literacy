Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, all the participants agreed to join. Then, the doctors
checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram,
also known as an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants stayed at the study site for 9 days. During
this time, the participants were given meals that had a high amount of potassium
and a low amount of sodium in them. For the last 4 days of this visit, the
participants took either 5 g or 10 g of ZS once a day with their breakfast.
Throughout the study, the researchers continued checking the health status of
the participants and taking blood and urine samples. Researchers also continued
doing ECGs to check heart health.
At the end of the study, the researchers called the participants to follow
up with them. During this call, the researchers asked the participants about
their overall health and how they were feeling.
The figure below shows how the study was done.
