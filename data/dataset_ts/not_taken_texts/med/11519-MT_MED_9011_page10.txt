To answer this question, the study doctors measured many different things to
assess the participants’ leukemia throughout the study, including:
X size of the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver
X amounts of certain types of cells and proteins in the blood, such as
lymphocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, and neutrophils
X health of bone marrow
The study doctors analyzed these different measurements using a set of rules
called the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines,
also called the “IWCLL” guidelines.
Then, the study doctors determined if each participant had a response to
treatment with acalabrutinib. A “response” means that the participant’s leukemia
symptoms decreased after treatment. According to the IWCLL guidelines,
a participant’s response to treatment can be either complete or partial. The
researchers calculated the percentage of participants who had either a complete
or partial response to acalabrutinib.
