The study drugs, MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, were each designed to stop the
tumor cells from interacting with some of these proteins. MEDI4736 does this by
attaching to a protein called PD-L1 on tumor cells. Tremelimumab does this by
attaching to a protein called CTLA-4 on tumor cells. This lets the immune cells
recognize the tumor cells again and help stop the tumor from growing.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about MEDI4736 alone or with
tremelimumab in a large number of participants. The participants had urothelial
cancer that had spread and could not be removed by surgery. The researchers
in this study wanted to compare MEDI4736 with and without tremelimumab to
standard chemotherapy. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did MEDI4736 with tremelimumab help the participants live longer than
chemotherapy?
> Did MEDI4736 alone help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live longer
than chemotherapy?
> Did the participants getting MEDI4736 with or without tremelimumab have
less severe symptoms?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if MEDI4736 helps improve the health of people with urothelial
cancer that has spread and cannot be removed by surgery.
