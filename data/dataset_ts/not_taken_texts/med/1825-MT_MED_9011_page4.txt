The participants got AZD2811 during 3-week or 4-week periods called “cycles”.
They could continue getting study treatment until:
X their cancer got worse
X they had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related
to AZD2811
X the study doctors thought they should stop taking AZD2811
X they chose to leave the study
The participants could choose to continue getting AZD2811 at the end of the
study if it was helping their cancer.
Some of the participants who got the high dose of AZD2811 were also given
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, also known as G-CSF. G-CSF helps the
immune system to make white blood cells that fight infection. The participants
who got G-CSF got it once every cycle, 1 week after the first dose of AZD2811.
