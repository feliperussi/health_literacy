Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants or
researchers knew which treatment the participants took. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the
results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
treatment each participant took so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants took either AZD0284 or a placebo as a liquid
by mouth. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before taking any study treatment, the participants visited their study site
1 time over the course of 2 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked to
make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• took samples of the participants’ skin plaques
• gave the participants surveys that asked them how itchy their skin plaques were
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
Throughout the study, the study doctors continued checking the participants’
overall health, taking samples of their skin plaques, and giving them surveys
asking how itchy their skin plaques were.
