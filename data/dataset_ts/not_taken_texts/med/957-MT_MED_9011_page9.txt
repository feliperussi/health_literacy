The researchers found that the LVEDV index scores changed only by a small
amount in the participants who took saxagliptin and in those who took the
placebo.
Overall, the researchers found that the average increase in the participants’ LVEDV
index scores after 24 weeks was:
> 0.9 mL/m2 in the participants who took saxagliptin
> 3.5 mL/m2 in the participants who took the placebo
The saxagliptin score was 2.6 mL/m2 less than the placebo score. This means that
saxagliptin did not affect the participants’ heart function.
