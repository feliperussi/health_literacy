Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca
Drug Studied: Savolitinib, also called volitinib and AZD6094
Study Title: A study to learn if savolitinib slows cancer growth
compared to sunitinib in participants with advanced
papillary kidney cancer
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug savolitinib, also
called AZD6094. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more
about savolitinib to help people with a type of kidney cancer called papillary renal
cell carcinoma. This cancer is also called PRCC.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it
helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 2 years. The study started in
July 2017 and ended in August 2019. The researchers planned to include 180
participants in the study, but the study was closed early. This was because results
from another study in people with PRCC suggested that this new type of treatment
may not affect this type of cancer any differently than existing treatments.
This study included 60 participants in Brazil, France, Italy, the Republic of Korea,
Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
