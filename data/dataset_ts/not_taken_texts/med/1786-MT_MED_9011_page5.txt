Symbicort Placebo
Treatment (study drug or placebo)
Was there a link between Symbicort and a change in the strain on the heart
compared to a placebo?
To answer this, researchers looked at participants’ heart function, lung function,
and difficulty breathing.
Heart function
It’s important for you to know that Symbicort was shown to change the
amount of oxygen used by participants’ bodies. Researchers are still trying to
understand if the increase caused by Symbicort in this study improved heart
function. To test heart function, researchers looked at the amount of oxygen
the blood takes in with every heartbeat. This is called the “oxygen pulse”.
In this study, participants’ oxygen pulse increased after taking Symbicort. This
result may mean that heart function improved, but the amount of this increase
was not large enough to know this for sure. Researchers are still trying to
understand the significance of this result.
Lung function
It is already known that Symbicort causes an increase in lung function. In
this study, there was an increase in the amount of air participants exhaled after
taking Symbicort.
