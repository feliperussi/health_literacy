Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with coronary artery
disease. The participants in this study were 37 to 76 years old when they joined.
The participants all had sudden reductions in blood flow to the heart up to
4 weeks before joining the study. The participants did not have other serious
heart or kidney problems.
The study included 129 participants in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat coronary artery disease.
Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD5718 works in a small
number of participants with coronary artery disease. They also wanted to find
out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It is also
called coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease. Coronary artery disease
happens when fat and cholesterol build up in the blood vessels of the heart.
These buildups are known as plaques, and they narrow the blood vessels.
Together with inflammation, this can block blood flow. This can cause chest pain
and discomfort. People with coronary heart disease are at high risk of having a
heart attack.
Researchers have found that plaque buildup can be linked with high levels of an
immune system molecule that causes inflammation called “leukotriene E4”. The
study drug, AZD5718, was designed to reduce the amount of leukotriene E4 in
the body. Researchers think that this will help reduce inflammation and plaque
buildup.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD5718 worked in
participants with coronary artery disease.
