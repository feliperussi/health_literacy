Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced NSCLC. The
participants in this study were 27 to 92 years old when they joined.
All of the participants had a specific change in a gene called “EGFR T790M
positive” in their tumors. This is also called a “mutation”. All of the participants
had also previously tried a type of treatment called an “EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor”, but their cancer had gotten worse.
The study included 3,017 participants in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia,
Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.
