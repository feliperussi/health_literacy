Clinical Trial RESULTS
What’s happened since my study ended?
The study started in July 2015 and ended in November 2015. The entire study took almost
4 months to complete and included 41 participants at 4 sites in the United States. When
the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This
is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Gout is a type of arthritis, or inflammation of the joints, that can cause pain and stiffness.
It is caused by too much uric acid in your blood. Uric acid is made when your body breaks
down certain substances. It usually leaves your body through urine. Gout can happen when
uric acid does not leave the body properly and instead builds up in the blood and joints.
The study drug RDEA3170 may treat gout by helping the kidneys filter out uric acid.
Researchers wanted to compare the combination of RDEA3170 and allopurinol to
allopurinol alone. Allopurinol is a drug that is already used to reduce uric acid in the blood
and treat gout. Researchers also wanted to study oxypurinol, xanthine, and hypoxanthine
in participants’ blood and/or urine. Oxypurinol is created by the body as it breaks down
allopurinol and helps reduce the amount of uric acid the body produces. Xanthine and
hypoxanthine occur in the body naturally, but higher levels of them in the blood can
increase the chance of developing gout. When the body breaks them down, they can form
uric acid, too much of which can lead to gout.
Researchers wanted to know:
• How did RDEA3170 and allopurinol together affect people with
gout compared to allopurinol alone?
• How did RDEA3170, allopurinol, and oxypurinol act in the body?
• Did participants have medical problems during the study?
