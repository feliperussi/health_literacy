Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make sure the
participants could join the study. They also checked the heart health of participants using
an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG. The doctors also asked about the medical
history of participants, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
There were 3 treatment visits during the study. Each participant took 1 treatment during
each visit. Some of the treatments were taken with food and some were taken without food.
There was a “washout period” of 1 to 2 weeks in between these visits. During this
time, the participants were not allowed to take certain medicines. This means that
their bodies had processed all of the medicines in their blood, and the medicines had
“washed out” of their bodies.
