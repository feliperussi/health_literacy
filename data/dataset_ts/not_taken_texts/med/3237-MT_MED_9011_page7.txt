The average total amount of AZD4635 was measured in nanograms per milliliter
per hour, also known as ng.h/mL. The researchers found that the average total
amount of AZD4635 in the participants’ blood was:
• 1,890 ng.h/mL in Treatment Period A

What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
