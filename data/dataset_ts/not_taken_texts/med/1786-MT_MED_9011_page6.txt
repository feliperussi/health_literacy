Clinical Trial RESULTS
To test lung function, researchers measured how much air participants could
exhale. After treatment, researchers found that the increase in the amount of air
exhaled by the lungs was greater for participants who took Symbicort than for
those who took the placebo.
Difficulty breathing
To test how difficult it was for participants to breathe, researchers asked
participants to rate their shortness of breath during activities. After treatment,
researchers found that participants who took Symbicort reported a greater
decrease in shortness of breath than those who took a placebo.
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem,
so researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants had during
the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may
not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems in the study?
The table below shows how many participants in the study developed medical
problems. Two participants stopped taking the study drug because of a
medical problem.
Symbicort Placebo
(51 participants) (51 participants)
How many participants
developed medical 13 (25.5%) 11 (21.6%)
problems?
How many participants developed serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes
lasting problems, or needs hospital care. In this study, no participants developed
serious medical problems while taking Symbicort, and 1 participant (2.0%)
developed a serious medical problem of pneumonia while taking a placebo.
No participants died during this study, and no new safety concerns were raised.
