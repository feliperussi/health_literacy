Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
There were 3 parts to this study. The participants in Parts 1 and 3 had advanced cancer that was no
longer responding to standard treatment. The participant in Part 2 had CTCL. Each part was “open-
label”. This means the researchers and the participant knew which study treatment the participant
was getting.
In each part, a group of participants started out getting a low, fixed dose of MEDI9197. The study
doctors looked at the safety results for these participants. Depending on the safety results and
general health of the participants, the researchers decided whether to increase or decrease the dose
in the next group of participants.
There were 3 study treatments that could be given in this study: MEDI9197, radiation therapy, and
durvalumab. Durvalumab is a cancer treatment that is approved to use for some types of cancer.
Researchers are also studying how to use it alone, and with other treatments, for other types of
cancer. Different combinations of treatments and doses were given to the participants.
The doses of MEDI9197 were given through a needle into the tumor. This is also called an
intratumoral injection. The doses of durvalumab were given through a needle into a vein. This is also
called an intravenous infusion or an IV infusion. MEDI9197 and durvalumab doses were measured in
milligrams, also called mg.
Some participants had tumors that were easy for doctors to access called surface tumors. Others
had tumors that were not easy for doctors to access called deep tumors.
The tables below show the different treatment groups in each part of the study. The researchers
expected to include other groups with different doses in the study, but no participants joined these
groups.
