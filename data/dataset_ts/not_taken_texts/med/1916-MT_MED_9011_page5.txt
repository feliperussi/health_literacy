Clinical Study Results
To answer this question, the researchers measured and compared the participants’
HDL levels before treatment and about 1 month after treatment. The results of these
measurements are listed below. The HDL levels were measured in milligrams per
deciliter, also called mg/dL.
Overall, the researchers found that about 1 month after treatment:
• The participants who got 30 mg of MEDI5884 had an average increase in
HDL levels of 2.3 mg/dL.
• The participants who got 100 mg of MEDI5884 had an average increase in
HDL levels of 21.6 mg/dL.
• The participants who got 300 mg of MEDI5884 had an average increase in
HDL levels of 20.0 mg/dL.
• The participants who got 600 mg of MEDI5884 had an average increase in
HDL levels of 25.1 mg/dL.
• The participants who got the placebo had an average increase in HDL levels
of 7.8 mg/dL.
The figure below shows these results.
