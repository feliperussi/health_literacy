What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to acalabrutinib.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by acalabrutinib. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for acalabrutinib.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
