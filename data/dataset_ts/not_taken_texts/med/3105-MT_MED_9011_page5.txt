Clinical Study Results
Did AZD0284 help decrease the severity of the participants’ skin plaques?
Because of the small number of participants in the study, the researchers could not
determine if AZD0284 helped decrease the severity of the skin plaques.
To answer this question, the study doctors used a measurement called the
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, also called PASI. The study doctors used the
PASI to give each participant a score based on:
• the redness of their skin plaques
• the thickness of their skin plaques
• the amount of skin peeling around their skin plaques
The study doctors gave the participants scores before they took treatment and after
4 weeks of taking treatment. The higher the scores, the more severe the psoriasis
symptoms were. The researchers compared the scores of the participants who
took AZD0284 with the scores of the participants who took the placebo.
