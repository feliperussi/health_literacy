Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: Ardea Biosciences, Inc.
Drug Studied: Lesinurad/Allopurinol Fixed-Dose Combination
Short Study Title: A study to measure and compare healthy adults’
blood levels of lesinurad and allopurinol after being
taken in a combined tablet and separate tablets,
both on an empty stomach
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drugs lesinurad and allopurinol. These drugs have
been developed to treat gout, a type of arthritis. You and the other participants helped researchers learn if
these drugs acted the same way in the body when taken on an empty stomach in a combined tablet or in
separate tablets. The study started in August 2017 and ended in October 2017.
Ardea Biosciences, Inc., the sponsor of this study, thanks you for your help and thinks it is important for
you to know the results of your study. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this
summary of the study results for you with the help of a medical writing organization. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff
at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat gout. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the
study. They also wanted to find out how lesinurad and allopurinol work in the body when they’re combined
into 1 tablet.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants and study staff knew what study drug each
participant took.
