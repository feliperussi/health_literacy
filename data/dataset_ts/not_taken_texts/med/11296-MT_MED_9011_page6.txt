The researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of the
participants’ other tests and measurements during the study. But, the researchers
did not consider these to be significant.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if
they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatments or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
During the study:
> 91.7% of participants who took cotadutide had adverse events. This was 11
out of 12 participants.
> 25.0% of participants who took the placebo had adverse events. This was 1
out of 4 participants.
> None of the participants had serious adverse events or stopped taking study
treatment due to adverse events.
The most common adverse events, which were seen in more than 2 participants,
were:
> Nausea
> Constipation
> Pain in the abdomen
> A low number of red blood cells, which take oxygen to the whole body
