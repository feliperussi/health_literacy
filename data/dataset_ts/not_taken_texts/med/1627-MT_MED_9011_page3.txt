Clinical Trial RESULTS
Researchers wanted to know:
• How much of the study drug reaches the blood after participants
take osimertinib in tablet form?
• How does the body break down osimertinib when it is swallowed
in tablet form compared to when it is injected?
• How safe is osimertinib to take and what medical problems did
participants have?
This study had 10 healthy men, ages 21 to 61.
What kind of study was this?
This study was an “open-label” study. “Open-label” means that both the
researchers and the participants knew what the participants were taking.
All participants got osimertinib, both in a tablet and in an injection. The
injection was given in a vein slowly over 15 minutes.
The drug in the injection was radiolabelled. This means that a substance
with radiation was used to help the researchers track where the drug is in
the body and to tell the differences between the drug in the tablet form
and the drug in the injection form.
