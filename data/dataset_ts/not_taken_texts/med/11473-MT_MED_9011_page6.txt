How did taking verinurad and allopurinol in different ways affect how
much of each got into the participants’ blood?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the
participants before and after they took each study treatment. The researchers
measured the amounts of verinurad and allopurinol in the participants’ blood.
After allopurinol gets broken down by the body, it is known as “oxypurinol”. The
researchers also measured the amount of oxypurinol in the participants’ blood to
get more information about how allopurinol acts in the body.
The researchers took 2 different types of measurements each for verinurad,
allopurinol, and oxypurinol. These were:
X The average highest amount in the blood
X The average total amount in the blood over time
