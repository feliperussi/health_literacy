Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during this
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study medicines. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study medicines. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a medicine causes an adverse reaction. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Some of the participants did not get any doses of study medicines, and some
participated in other studies, so their information could not be used. Therefore, the
researchers studied the medical problems for 2,361 of the 2,389 participants.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
There were 0.2% of participants who had serious adverse reactions during this
study. This was 5 out of 2,361 participants.
The table below shows the serious adverse reactions that happened during this study.
