MEDI0382 was designed to act like 2 proteins found in the body that can
decrease body weight. These proteins are called “glucagon-like peptide 1”, also
called GLP-1, and “glucagon”.
X GLP-1 can decrease body weight by decreasing blood glucose levels and
hunger.
X Glucagon can decrease body weight by decreasing the body’s sugar
stores, also called glycogen, and hunger. Glucagon causes the breakdown
of glycogen to provide the body with energy. Glycogen is a form of glucose
that is stored in the liver and can be turned into glucose when blood
glucose levels are low. Glucagon also causes the breakdown of fats in the
liver, which provides energy when the body is not getting food.
Researchers think that MEDI0382, which acts like both GLP-1 and glucagon,
might help people with T2DM who are likely to have NAFLD/NASH. The
researchers think that MEDI0382 may help liver health, decrease body weight,
and reduce blood sugar levels in patients with T2DM.
But, researchers are not exactly sure how MEDI0382 works in the human body.
This is because GLP-1 and glucagon each have opposite effects on glycogen.
X GLP-1 increases liver glycogen and decreases blood glucose levels.
X Glucagon decreases liver glycogen and increases blood glucose levels.
So, the researchers want to better understand how MEDI0382 changes glycogen
levels in the liver so they can know how exactly MEDI0382 works in the human body.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how MEDI0382 works in a small
number of participants who were overweight or obese with T2DM. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
