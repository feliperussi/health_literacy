Clinical Study Results
The researchers found that after participants took the study drugs, there were changes in
their blood or urine tests that doctors thought were important.
There were changes in the levels of:
• hemoglobin in red blood cells
• overall white blood cell counts
• certain types of white blood cells, called lymphocytes and neutrophils
• platelets, which are needed to help the blood clot
• glucose
• blood clotting proteins
• creatinine
• potassium
• bilirubin
• alanine aminotransferase, a liver enzyme
• aspartate aminotransferase, a liver enzyme
The researchers found that there were no significant changes to the vital signs and ECG
tests done throughout the study.
The researchers also collected information about how many “adverse events” the
participants had. An adverse event is any medical problem that happens during the study.
Adverse events are considered “serious” when they are life-threatening, cause lasting
problems, or require hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the
study drugs. This section talks about adverse events that happened during the study.
Some of these adverse events are also included in the “What medical problems did
participants have during the study?” section.
How many participants had adverse events?
• All of the participants in the study had an adverse event. This was 54 out of 54
participants.
• 18.5% of the participants had at least 1 serious adverse event during the study.
This was 10 out of 54 participants.
• 7.4% of the participants stopped taking any study drug because of adverse events.
This was 4 out of 54 participants.
