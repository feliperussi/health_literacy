Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did different doses of AZD7594 affect the amount of air the participants could
breathe out?
• Did the participants feel that AZD7594 helped them control their asthma?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD7594 helps improve breathing and symptoms in people with
asthma.
What treatments did the participants take?
Before the participants took any study treatment, they took an ICS asthma
treatment called budesonide twice daily for up to 4 weeks. Then, a computer
program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took.
This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
There were 2 parts to this study that happened at the same time. There was 1
part that was “double-blind”. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
taking.
In the double-blind part, the participants took either AZD7594 or a placebo
through an inhaler. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine
in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in
the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
