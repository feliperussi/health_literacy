Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy Chinese men and women. The
participants in this study were between 19 and 50 years old when they joined.
The study included 80 participants at a single study site in China.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
Before drugs can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe they are and how they work. In some studies, the research is
done in healthy people before further studies are done in people who have the
condition the drugs are intended to treat.
In people with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin or
does not use insulin as well as it should. Insulin controls the level of sugar in the
blood, which is also called “glucose”. Type 2 diabetes causes blood glucose
levels to rise higher than normal. This can cause medical problems.
Dapagliflozin and metformin are both taken as tablets. They are approved for
treating type 2 diabetes in the United States, the European Union, and some
parts of Asia including China.
Some people need only 1 type of treatment to help control their diabetes, while
others need several treatments. Controlling blood sugar levels can often mean
taking multiple treatments. If a tablet that combines dapagliflozin and metformin
in a single tablet is shown to work the same or in a similar way to separate
tablets, it may be a helpful treatment option for Chinese men and women with
type 2 diabetes.
