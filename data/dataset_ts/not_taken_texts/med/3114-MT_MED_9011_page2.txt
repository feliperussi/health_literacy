Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who need emergency
treatment for high blood potassium. Before a drug can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if SZC works in a small number of
participants who needed emergency treatment for high blood potassium. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
People with high levels of potassium in their blood often don’t have any symptoms
that can be seen, but may have problems with their heartbeat. This can be
dangerous and in rare cases, it can lead to death.
Very high blood potassium is normally treated with a type of sugar called glucose
and a hormone called insulin that lowers glucose in the blood. This treatment
works quickly to remove potassium from the blood but only lasts for 4 to 6 hours.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if adding SZC to insulin and glucose
treatment affected the participants’ blood potassium levels 4 hours after treatment.
SZC was designed to work by attaching to potassium in the gut and stopping it
from getting into the blood.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did SZC decrease the amount of potassium in the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and
women who needed emergency treatment for high blood potassium. The participants
in this study were 30 to 95 years old. People whose high blood potassium could not
be treated by insulin and glucose could not take part in this study.
