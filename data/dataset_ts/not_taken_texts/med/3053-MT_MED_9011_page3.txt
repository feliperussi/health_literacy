Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was taking.
ZS was taken by mouth, as a powder mixed with water. The doses of ZS were measured
in grams, also called g.
There were 2 parts to this study, and there were different treatments in each part.
Part 1
In this part of the study, all of the participants took 10 g of ZS. They took this dose 3 times
a day for up to 3 days. The amount of time that each participant was in Part 1 was based
on the participant’s blood potassium levels.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants took in Part 1:
Number of days in Part 1 Number of total doses Total amount of ZS
1 day 3 30 g
2 days 6 60 g
3 days 9 90 g
If a participant’s blood potassium level was normal, they could join Part 2 of the study right
away. At the end of Part 1 all participants had normal blood potassium levels and joined
Part 2 of the study.
Part 2
In this part of the study, participants took ZS for up to a year. All of the participants took
5 g of ZS once a day when they started Part 2, but the doctor could increase or decrease
their amount of ZS. This was based on how high their blood potassium was at their study
site visits. During Part 2, the dose could be increased to 15 g each day, or decreased to
either:
• 5 g every other day
• 2.5 g every day
