Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped them control their
asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants felt that their asthma was more
controlled after getting tezepelumab compared to before they started the study.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to answer a
questionnaire about their asthma symptoms. The questionnaire is called the Asthma
Control Questionnaire-6, also called ACQ-6. The participants received scores from 0 to 5
based on their responses. A lower score on the ACQ-6 means asthma symptoms are well
controlled. From these scores, the researchers calculated the percentage of participants
whose asthma was well controlled. They compared the results for each injection device
from before and after 24 weeks of treatment.
At the start of the study, the percentage of participants who had well controlled
asthma as measured on the ACQ-6 was:
> 1.8% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the accessorized pre-filled
syringe. This was 2 out of 111 participants.
> 1.0% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the autoinjector. This was 1 out
of 105 participants.
