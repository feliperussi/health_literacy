Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with advanced or metastatic solid
tumors. The participants had already tried other treatments for their cancer, but it
was still getting worse.
The study included 8 participants in the United States and Canada.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced or metastatic solid
tumors. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in
an organ of the body. “Advanced” usually means that the cancer keeps growing
even with treatment. The cancer may also be “metastatic”. This means that it has
spread to other parts of the body or has grown beyond the organ where it started.
Treatments for cancer do not help all people. So, researchers are looking for new
ways to treat cancer. The study drug, MEDI7247, was designed to stop tumor cells
from growing out of control.
In this study, the researchers mainly wanted to find out about the safety of
MEDI7247 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
