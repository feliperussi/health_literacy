Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
To see if you could join the study, study doctors did a physical examination by checking
your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Study doctors took blood
and urine samples and checked your heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG. Study doctors also asked about your medical history, how you were
feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
Study doctors also did computed tomography scans, or CT scans, on participants
throughout the study. These scans help doctors look at the inside of the body and study
diseases, such as cancer.
Participants in this study were placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups. One treatment group
got only durvalumab, and the other treatment group got durvalumab and tremelimumab.
Participants in both treatment groups visited their study site at least 20 times.
Durvalumab-only group
In this treatment group, 33 participants were assigned to get treatment with
durvalumab. Of these, 32 got an injection of 1.5 grams of durvalumab once every 4
weeks for up to 1 year at their study site. One of these 33 participants left the study
before the researchers could collect all of the study data.
Durvalumab and tremelimumab group
In this treatment group, 32 participants got injections of 1.5 grams of durvalumab and
75 milligrams, also known as mg, of tremelimumab once every 4 weeks for up to 4
months at their study site.
Then, these participants got an injection of 1.5 grams of durvalumab once every 4 weeks
for up to 8 months.
After treatment ended, the study doctors checked the health of participants in both
treatment groups. All participants visited their site once every 6 weeks for 1 year and then
once every 12 weeks until their tumors shrank or disappeared.
