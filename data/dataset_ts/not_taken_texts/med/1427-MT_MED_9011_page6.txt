What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants got either:
> MEDI4736 with tremelimumab
> MEDI4736 alone
> Standard chemotherapy
Each treatment was given through a needle into a vein. This is known as an
intravenous infusion, also known as an IV infusion.
The doses of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab were measured in milligrams, also
known as mg.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got their study treatment until their cancer got worse, the study
doctors decided they should stop study treatment, or they left the study.
