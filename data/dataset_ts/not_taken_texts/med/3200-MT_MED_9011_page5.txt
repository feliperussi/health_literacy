Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants in this study had serious adverse reactions.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
There were 42.9% of participants who had adverse reactions during the study. This was
6 out of 14 participants. The only type of adverse reaction in the study was diarrhea.
None of the participants stopped taking omega-3 carboxylic acids during the study
because of adverse reactions.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
The results from this study helped the researchers learn how omega-3 carboxylic acids
act in healthy Chinese participants.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with omega-3 carboxylic acids are ongoing.
