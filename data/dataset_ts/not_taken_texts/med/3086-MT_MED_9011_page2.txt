Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with COPD. Before a
drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to figure
out how it works and how safe it is.
COPD is a long-term condition that causes the airways to narrow. This can cause
medical problems like coughing, lung infection, and difficulty breathing.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much AB/FF and 2 AB
“metabolites” were in the blood in a small number of participants with COPD.
Metabolites are substances the body creates to break down a drug and remove
it from the blood and body through fluids, such as urine or sweat. When a person
takes AB/FF, their body breaks down AB into 2 different metabolites.
At the time of this study, AB/FF was being used to treat patients who have COPD
in some countries, but not in China. So, the researchers wanted to learn more
about how much of AB/FF and the 2 AB metabolites were in the blood of Chinese
patients. The researchers also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much of AB/FF and the AB metabolites were in the blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of
Chinese men and women with COPD. The participants in this study were 41 to 67
years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
All of the participants took AB/FF through an inhaler.
