What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did AZD4831 reduce the activity of MPO in the blood?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples before and after
the participants took study treatment. The researchers then analyzed the blood
samples to find out if AZD4831 reduced the amount of MPO in the blood. This
could tell them if the activity of MPO had reduced. The researchers had planned:
X to compare the activity of MPO in the blood after 30 days of taking study
treatment to the activity of MPO in the blood at the start of the study.
X to compare the results from the participants who took AZD4831 with the
results from the participants who took the placebo. This was done at the end
of study treatment and included all the participants in the study.
This study was stopped early because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of
this, there was not enough data for the researchers to answer the second question
as they had originally planned.
However, the first question could be answered. They did this for 14 of the
27 participants who took AZD4831. Compared to the start of the study, the
researchers found that the activity of MPO in the blood was reduced by 68.0% for
these participants after 30 days of taking study treatment.
