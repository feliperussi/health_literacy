What treatments did the participants
take?
All of the participants took verinurad and allopurinol. They took different
combinations of these drugs as 5 different treatments. They took some of the
treatments after eating breakfast, and some without eating breakfast, which is
known as “fasting”. All of the participants took 1 dose each of the 5 treatments
in different orders. They waited 5 days between taking each treatment.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers,
study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking. A
computer program was used to randomly choose the order each participant
took their treatments in. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
