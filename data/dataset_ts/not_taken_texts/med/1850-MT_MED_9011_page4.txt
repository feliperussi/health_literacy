Clinical Study Results
The figure below shows how Part B of the study was done.
Double-blind study: 63 participants
5 treatment visits
Visit 2 through 6
(63 participants)
Screening visit Participants got 1 of the treatments shown below 5 follow-up visits
Visit 1 at each visit for a total of 5 doses. Participants Visits 7 through 11
could only get 1 of these 4 treatments:
• 15 participants got the placebo
• 9 participants got 50 mg of MEDI4166
• 18 participants got 200 mg of MEDI4166
• 21 participants got 400 mg of MEDI4166
After the last Part A treatment visit, you and the other participants visited your study site up
to 7 times so that the study doctors could check your health again.
After the last Part B treatment visit, you and the other participants visited your study site up
to 5 times so that the study doctors could check your health again.
What were the study results?
This section is a summary of the main results of the study up to April 2017. The results each
participant had might be different and might not be included in this summary. It is important
to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work
best and are safest for patients.

How did MEDI4166 affect the amount of bad cholesterol in participants?
In Part A and Part B, researchers compared the change in the amount of bad cholesterol in
participants from the beginning of the study to Day 36 of the study. When the data were
analyzed, researchers found that:
Part A
In Part A, participants who got the different MEDI4166 doses had a decrease in their bad
cholesterol levels. This decrease got bigger with higher doses of the drug.
Part B
In Part B:
• Participants who got 50 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in bad cholesterol of
48.4 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL
• Participants who got 200 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in bad cholesterol of
76.1 mg/dL
• Participants who got 400 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in bad cholesterol of
75.9 mg/dL
• Participants who got the placebo had an average decrease in bad cholesterol of 1.3 mg/dL
