Clinical Study Results
During this period, the 883 participants were scheduled to take 1 of 3 drug treatments once
a day.
Throughout the study, the doctors continued checking the health of the participants and
asking how they were feeling. The doctors also took more blood and urine samples and
checked the HbA1c levels of the participants.

What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers
wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. If a full
report of the study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Some of the 883 participants left the study before it ended. So the researchers could not
study the results and medical problems for all of the participants.
