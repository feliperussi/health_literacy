There are treatments that can help people who have asthma to manage their
symptoms. Some people who have severe asthma need several different
treatments to help control their asthma. But, these treatments may not help some
people control their symptoms.
The study drug, tezepelumab, is being developed as a treatment for asthma to
help reduce inflammation in the lungs. In this study, the researchers wanted to find
out if tezepelumab reduced the number of asthma attacks that the participants had
over 1 year.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did tezepelumab affect the number of asthma attacks over 1 year?
> Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped their quality of life or
helped them control their asthma?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if tezepelumab helps improve the health of people with severe
asthma.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants got either tezepelumab or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug
are actually caused by the drug. The participants also continued to take their usual
asthma treatments.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could
create a report of the study results.
