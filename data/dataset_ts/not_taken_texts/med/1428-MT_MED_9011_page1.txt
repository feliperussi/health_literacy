Thank you
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drugs durvalumab and
tremelimumab.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about how durvalumab and
tremelimumab may be able to help people with advanced head and neck cancer. This
type of cancer is known as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, also called HNSCC.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants, their families, and caregivers understand and feel proud of their important
role in medical research.
If you or someone you know participated in the study and have questions about the
results, please speak with the study doctor or staff at your study site.
