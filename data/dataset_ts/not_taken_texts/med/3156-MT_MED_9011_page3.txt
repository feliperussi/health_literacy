Clinical Study Results
How did lesinurad and allopurinol act in the body?
The researchers wanted to know how lesinurad and allopurinol acted in the body when taken in one
tablet compared to when they were taken in separate tablets. Researchers measured the average amounts of
lesinurad and allopurinol in the blood and the highest amounts in the blood.
The researchers used microgram hours per milliliter, also called μg·hr/mL, to measure the average amounts
in the blood.
The researchers found that:
• Participants had about the same amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol in their blood no matter
which treatment they took.
The researchers used microgram per milliliter, also called μg/mL, to measure the highest amounts in
the blood.
The researchers found that:
• Participants had about the same highest amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol in their blood
no matter which treatment they took.
What medical problems did participants have after taking
lesinurad and allopurinol?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think might be related
to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is
life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small
number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities. The websites listed at the
end of this summary may have other information about medical problems that happened in this study.
