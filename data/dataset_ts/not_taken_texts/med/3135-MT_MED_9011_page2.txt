Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid
tumors. The participants in this study were 26 to 81 years old when they joined.
The study included 78 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before
a treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
These extra cells can form tumors. When cancer reaches the “advanced” stage, it
means that the cancer keeps growing, even with treatment.
At this stage, the cancer is often “metastatic”. This means that the tumors have
spread into other tissue near the organ where they started or to other parts of the
body.
The study drugs, AZD9150 and durvalumab, were each designed to stop different
proteins in the body from allowing tumors to grow.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD9150 and
durvalumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
