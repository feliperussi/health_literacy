What treatments did the participants
take?
In this study, all of the participants were planned to take either ceralasertib by
itself, or ceralasertib with acalabrutinib.
There were 2 groups in this study:
X Participants in Group 1 took ceralasertib by itself
X Participants in Group 2 took ceralasertib together with acalabrutinib
The participants who joined the study first were in Group 1. Participants who
joined the study later were in Group 2.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
Acalabrutinib and ceralasertib were both taken by mouth. Acalabrutinib was
taken as a capsule, and ceralasertib was taken as a tablet.
