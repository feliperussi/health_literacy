What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD2811 helps improve the health of people with advanced
solid tumors.
What treatments did the participants take?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
This study had 2 parts. Part 1 was the “dose escalation” part of the study. This
means that in this part, some of the participants started out getting a low dose of
AZD2811. The study doctors looked at the results for these participants. Then, the
researchers decided whether to increase the dose of AZD2811 in the next group
of participants.
Part 2 was the “dose expansion” part of the study. This means that in this part, a
different group of participants got the highest and safest dose from Part 1. All of
the participants in Part 2 got the same dose of AZD2811.
Each participant stayed in the same dose group throughout the study.
