What signs and symptoms did the participants have during Parts 2 and 3?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements throughout
Parts 2 and 3. The doctors did physical exams and tested the participants’ blood
and urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check
the participants’ heart health. Overall, the researchers found that there were no
meaningful changes in the results of these tests and measurements.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do
not think the adverse events might be related to the study drugs.
