SGRQ
After the participants completed the SGRQ survey, the researchers calculated the
score for each participant based on their responses to the survey. SGRQ scores
could range from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the more a participant’s asthma
was affecting their quality of life.
The researchers calculated the scores for all of the participants before they started
getting benralizumab and at the end of the study.
The researchers found that, on average, the participants’ SGRQ scores
decreased by 19.66 points by the end of the study.
The researchers also counted how many participants’ SGRQ scores decreased by
at least 4 points. The study doctors think that a decrease of 4 points could mean
that benralizumab helped the participants’ quality of life.
Overall, there were 47.5% of participants whose SGRQ scores decreased by at
least 4 points by the end of the study. This was 284 out of 598 participants. This
means that overall, the participants felt that their quality of life was less affected by
their asthma than before the study.
