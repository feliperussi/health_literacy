Clinical Study Results
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 20 months, but the entire study took
about 2.5 years to finish. The study started in January 2017 and ended for most
participants in August 2019.
This study included a total of 62 participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat ovarian, fallopian tube, and
peritoneal cancers in women whose cancer came back or got worse after
chemotherapy and other treatments. Before a drug can be approved for patients
to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and if and how it
works.
Cediranib and olaparib work in different ways to help slow the growth of the
cancer. Cediranib reduces the supply of food and oxygen to the tumor by slowing
or stopping the growth of new blood vessels into the tumor. Olaparib helps to
stop cancer cells from being able to repair themselves when they were damaged.
Researchers think that taking cediranib and olaparib together may help fight
these cancers more than taking either study drug alone.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how cediranib and olaparib affected
tumors in participants with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal
cancer. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during the study.
