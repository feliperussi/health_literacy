Clinical Trial RESULTS
WHAT’S HAPPENED SINCE MY STUDY ENDED?
The study started in May 2015 and ended in June 2015. The entire study took less
than 1 month to complete. It included 35 participants at 1 site in the United States.
When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
WHY WAS THE RESEARCH NEEDED?
Before a new medicine can be given to patients, the company developing it must do
research studies to show that it is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new
medicine is to test it in healthy people, before testing it in patients with the disease
the medicine will treat. This can include testing different forms of the medicine, like a
tablet and a capsule. A tablet is a solid pill, while a capsule is a small gelatin container.
Tablets and capsules are both swallowed and both contain 1 dose of the drug.
This study had 35 healthy men between the ages of 18 and 65 years. It tested a drug
called RDEA3170 that is being developed to help treat gout. Gout happens in some
people who have too much uric acid in their blood. Uric acid is made when the body
breaks down a substance in the body called purine. Purine is also in some foods. Most
uric acid leaves the body through urine. RDEA3170 may help treat gout by helping
the body get rid of more uric acid.
Until now, participants in studies took RDEA3170 as a tablet. Researchers wanted
to find out if a capsule could work as well as a tablet.
Researchers wanted to know:
• Did RDEA3170 capsules give participants as much medicine
as RDEA3170 tablets?
• Did eating food affect how RDEA3170 capsules act in the body?
• Did RDEA3170 help the body get rid of uric acid?
• Did participants have medical problems during the study?
