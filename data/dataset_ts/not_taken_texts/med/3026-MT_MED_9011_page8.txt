Clinical Study Results
Before the study started, the researchers thought that MEDI3506 might cause
specific types of adverse events. The researchers wanted to learn if the
participants getting MEDI3506 in this study had these specific types of adverse
events. These adverse events are known as “adverse events of special interest”,
also called AESIs.
The table below shows how many participants had AESIs during this study.
