Clinical Trial RESULTS
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in June 2016 and ended in September 2016. It
included 14 participants at 1 study site in the United States. When the
study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be approved, research must be done to show that
it is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new drug is to test it in
healthy people, or in people without any serious health problems.
Researchers in this study were interested in finding a better way to
treat breast cancer. The study drug, AZD9496, is being developed
to treat this disease.
Researchers wanted to know:
• How did AZD9496 act in the body?
• What medical problems did participants have after taking
AZD9496?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was an “open-label” study. This means that both the study
staff and participants knew what treatment each participant took.
In this study, all participants took AZD9496. There were 4 treatments
of AZD9496 that were taken in capsule form. In a capsule, the study
drug has an outer covering made of gelatin.
The other treatment of AZD9496 was taken in tablet form. In a tablet,
the study drug is in a solid form without a covering.
Your study included 14 healthy men who were 40 to 58 years old.
