Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
also known as “CLL”.
The participants in this study had refractory or relapsed CLL, which meant
that their CLL had either not responded to treatment or gotten worse after
treatment. They also had high-risk CLL, which meant that their cancer was more
likely to cause more medical problems.
The participants in this study were 53 to 74 years old when they joined.
The study included 11 participants in Poland and the United Kingdom.
