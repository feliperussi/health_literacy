Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 2 times
over the course of 4 weeks. At these visits, the study doctors checked to make
sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
• explained how to take the inhaled treatments during the study
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
Part A
During Part A, most of the participants visited their study site 1 time and stayed
there for about 3 days. During this visit, they took 1 inhaled dose of either AZD8154
or the placebo. The doses of AZD8154 were made up of either small or large bits
called “particles”. Most of the AZD8154 doses were “small-particle” treatments, but
1 was a “large-particle” treatment. The researchers wanted to compare a small-
particle and large-particle form of the same AZD8154 dose.
About 2 weeks after their first visit, 6 participants who took 1 of the doses of
AZD8154 had another visit at their study site for about 3 days. During this visit,
they took the same dose of AZD8154, but as a large-particle treatment.
Part B
The participants in Part B visited their study site 2 times over the course of about
3 weeks. During both visits, they stayed at their study site for about 3 days.
All 6 participants in Part B got the same treatments. During their first visit, they got
1 dose of AZD8154 through an IV. Then, they waited about 2 weeks before their
next visit.
During their second visit, the participants took a small-particle treatment of AZD8154
through an inhaler.
