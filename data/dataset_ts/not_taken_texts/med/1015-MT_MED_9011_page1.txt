Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: AstraZeneca K.K.
Drug studied: Dapagliflozin
Short study title: A study to learn how dapagliflozin combined with insulin acts
in the body and if dapagliflozin is safe to take with insulin
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the study drug dapagliflozin. The study started
in October 2015 and ended in June 2016.
AstraZeneca K.K. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP and a medical
writing organization called Synchrogenix helped prepare this summary of the study results. We
hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 1 diabetes. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is.
The researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the
study. They also wanted to find out how dapagliflozin works in the body when taken with
insulin. This information is important to know before other studies can be done that help find
out if dapagliflozin improves the health of people with type 1 diabetes when taken with insulin.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what participants were
taking, but the participants did not.
In this study, participants took dapagliflozin with insulin or a placebo with insulin. A placebo
looks like a drug, but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help
make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused
by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the
results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
