What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did benralizumab shrink the participants’ nasal polyps and reduce how
blocked their nose was?
X Did benralizumab help improve the participants’ nasal polyp symptoms or
their quality of life?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if benralizumab helps improve the health of people with
severe nasal polyps.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got either benralizumab or a placebo. A
placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take
the treatment are actually caused by the treatment.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could
create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got their randomly chosen study treatment through a needle
under the skin, also called a subcutaneous injection. The dose of benralizumab
was measured in milligrams, also called mg.
