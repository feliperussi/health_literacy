Clinical Study Results
How many participants stopped taking the study drug because of
adverse events?
There were 3.4% of participants who stopped taking the study drug during the
study because of serious adverse events. This was 28 out of 813 participants.
There were 7.3% of participants who stopped taking the study drug during the
study because of adverse events. This was 59 out of 813 participants.
How many participants had adverse events of special interest?
The researchers also wanted to find out if participants had specific medical
problems called “adverse events of special interest”. An adverse event of
special interest is an adverse event that is meaningful for a specific study drug
or condition. It may or may not be related to the study drug or condition, but the
researchers give it special attention.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out in particular about 2 adverse
events of special interest. These were severe low blood sugar levels and
increased levels of acid in the blood.
Severe low blood sugar levels
People with type 1 diabetes can have episodes where their blood sugar levels
get too low, also called hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia are episodes of low
blood sugar levels that make a person sick enough that they need someone to
help them raise their blood sugar level.
In this study, the doctors kept track of how many times participants had severe
hypoglycemia. These episodes were counted whether or not the doctors thought
they might be related to the study drug.
Overall, during the study, the number of participants who had episodes of severe
hypoglycemia was similar between participants who took 5 mg of dapagliflozin
with insulin and participants who took 10 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin.
