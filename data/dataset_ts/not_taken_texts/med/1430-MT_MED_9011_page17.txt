What medical problems happened during the
study?
The medical problems that the participants in Group 2 had during this study
are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants,
leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drugs are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how adavosertib and carboplatin
worked in participants with ES-SCLC who had received chemotherapy that was no
longer helping their cancer.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with this combination of study drugs in this disease are not
planned.
