What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if taking fluvoxamine and/or smoking
affected the amount of AZD4635 that got into the blood of healthy participants.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did taking fluvoxamine and/or smoking affect how much AZD4635 got into
the participants’ blood?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This information is important to know before other studies can be done to help
find out if AZD4635 improves the health of people who have cancer.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took:
X AZD4635 as capsules by mouth
X Fluvoxamine as tablets by mouth
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew which of these treatments each participant was
taking during the study.
This study happened in 2 parts. In each part, half of the participants were smokers,
and the other half were non-smokers.
Part 1 of the study lasted for 6 days. In Part 1, all of the participants took 1 dose of
AZD4635 on day 1.
Part 2 of the study lasted for 11 days. In Part 2, all of the participants took
fluvoxamine every day for 10 days. They also took 1 dose of AZD4635 on day 6.
