How many participants had 8.3% (22) 6.4% (7) 30.4% (14)
serious adverse reactions?
A total of 23 participants stopped taking their assigned treatment due to medical
problems that may or may not have been related to the study treatments,
which means they may or may not be related to adverse reactions. This was:
X 1.8% of participants who were taking olaparib on its own.
This was 2 of 110 participants.
X 11.0% of participants who were taking olaparib and ceralasertib.
This was 12 of 109 participants.
X 19.6% of participants who were taking olaparib and adavosertib.
This was 9 of 46 participants.
The olaparib and adavosertib group was stopped early because of an adverse
reaction that happened in some participants in that group. This adverse reaction was
a condition called “febrile neutropenia”. This is when a person has a fever and a low
level of white blood cells called neutrophils, which help the body fight infections.
