The participants got MEDI7247 during 3-week or 4-week periods called “cycles”.
They could continue getting study treatment until their cancer got worse, they had
medical problems the study doctors thought might be related to MEDI7247, or
chose to leave the study. The participants could choose to continue treatment at
the end of the study if the study treatment was helping their cancer.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants got.
