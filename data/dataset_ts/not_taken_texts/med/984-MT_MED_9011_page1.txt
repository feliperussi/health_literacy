Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
dapagliflozin. You and all of the other participants helped researchers learn
more about dapagliflozin to help people with type 2 diabetes.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it
helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 1 year. The entire study took
2 years to finish, starting in January 2016 and ending in January 2018.
The study included 121 participants in the Republic of Korea.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created
a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
