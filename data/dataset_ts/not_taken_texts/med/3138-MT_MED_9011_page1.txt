Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
MEDI0382. MedImmune Ltd., an AstraZeneca company, sponsored this study and
thinks it is important to share the results. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 9 weeks. The study started in January
2018 and ended in April 2018.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 32 participants from the United States. Of these, 24
participants were of Japanese descent and 8 were of Chinese descent.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, also called T2DM. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
T2DM is a common condition that causes the levels of blood sugar to rise higher
than normal. This often happens in people who are overweight and do not
exercise.
