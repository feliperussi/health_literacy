Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people whose type 2 diabetes is causing
their kidneys to leak protein into their urine. Before a drug can be approved for people to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if taking RDEA3170 and febuxostat
together works in a small number of participants with type 2 diabetes who have mild to
moderate amounts of protein in their urine. They also wanted to find out if the participants
had any medical problems during the study.
Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease. In people with diabetes,
the kidneys may not work as well as they should and let protein leak into the urine. This
may get worse over time and eventually the kidneys may stop working.
Uric acid is a waste product of the body and is found in urine and blood. Lowering the level
of uric acid in the blood may prevent or slow kidney damage in people with type 2 diabetes.
RDEA3170 works by increasing the amount of uric acid that leaves the body in the urine.
Febuxostat works by decreasing the amount of uric acid that the body makes. Both drugs
work in different ways to lower the amount of uric acid in the body. Researchers want to
find out if taking more than 1 treatment to lower the amount of uric acid has an effect on
the kidneys in people with type 2 diabetes.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did RDEA3170 and febuxostat affect how much protein leaks into the urine?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women
who had type 2 diabetes, mild or moderate amounts of protein leaking into the urine, and
high levels of uric acid in their blood. The participants in this study were 41 to 82 years old.
