What were the study results?
This section tells you results of some of the questions researchers asked in
your study. They look at the results of many studies, like yours, to decide which
medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with
AZD5718 are currently planned.
What was the highest dose of AZD5718 that was safe to take?
In this study, researchers gave participants several different doses of AZD5718.
They wanted to learn if any of these doses could cause serious medical problems.
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care. No one in your study had a serious medical
problem. Because of this, researchers did not find the highest dose of AZD5718 that
was safe to take. All of the doses of the study drug were safe to take.
