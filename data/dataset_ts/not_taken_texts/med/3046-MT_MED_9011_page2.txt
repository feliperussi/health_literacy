Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
The flu is an infection that can cause medical problems, including fever and muscle
aches. There are several different types of flu, and each type is known as a “strain”.
The study vaccine, MEDI3250, was created to defend the body against 1 strain
of the flu. The MEDI3250 vaccine is a medicine that has a weakened version of a
virus in it. Doctors give patients vaccines so that their bodies can fight the virus and
help prevent disease in the future.
Every year, researchers make a new vaccine against the flu. Before the MEDI3250
vaccine can be approved for patients to take, researchers do a clinical study to find
out how safe it is.
Researchers already did studies that showed how the MEDI3250 vaccine helped
prevent the flu. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about the
safety of the MEDI3250 vaccine.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants who took the MEDI3250 vaccine have more or fewer
symptoms compared to the participants who took the placebo?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of healthy
men and women. The participants in this study were 18 to 49 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants, doctors,
or other study staff knew which group each participant was in. Some studies are
done this way because knowing what group the participants are in can affect the
results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
group each participant was in so they could create a report of the study results.
