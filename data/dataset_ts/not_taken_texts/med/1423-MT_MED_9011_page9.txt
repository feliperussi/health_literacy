Clinical Study Results
How long the participants lived after starting the study
The researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab together did
not live longer compared to the participants who got SOC treatment.
Overall, the researchers found that after starting the study:
• The participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab together lived for a median of about
11.9 months.
• The participants who got SOC treatment lived for a median of about 12.9 months.
The figure below shows these results.

Did the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab together live longer
without their cancer getting worse compared to the participants who got SOC
treatment?
No. The researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab together
did not live longer without their cancer getting worse compared to the participants who got SOC
treatment.
To answer this question, the researchers compared:
• the “hazard ratio” between the 2 groups
• how long the participants lived before their cancer got worse
• the percentage of participants likely to be alive without their cancer getting worse 1 year after
starting treatment
