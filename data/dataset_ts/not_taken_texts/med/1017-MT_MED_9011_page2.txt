Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic kidney
disease, also called CKD. Before a drug can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make
sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually
caused by the drug.
The participants also continued taking any CKD treatments they were taking before
the study started.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did dapagliflozin help prevent the participants’ CKD from getting
worse compared to the placebo?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that dapagliflozin helped prevent the
participants’ CKD from getting worse compared to the placebo.
• What serious medical problems happened during the study?
There were 2.3% of participants who took dapagliflozin who had serious
medical problems during the study that the study doctors thought might be
related to study treatment.
There were 2.1% of participants who took the placebo who had serious
medical problems during the study that the study doctors thought might be
related to study treatment.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
