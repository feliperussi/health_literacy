Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are
done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can
affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found
out which treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the
study results.
The participants in the study were already taking insulin. During the study, the
participants also took either dapagliflozin or a placebo.
A placebo looks like the study drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take a treatment are actually caused by that treatment.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the participants visited their study site 5 times over the
course of up to 12 weeks. During these visits, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took urine samples
• checked the HbA1c levels of the participants
• checked the participants’ blood sugar levels throughout the study
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
Before the participants took treatment, the participants filled out questionnaires
about how they were feeling.
