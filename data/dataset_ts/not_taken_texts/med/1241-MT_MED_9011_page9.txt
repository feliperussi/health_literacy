The researchers measured this during the allergen challenge that was done after
8 weeks of taking study treatment. The researchers did this before the allergen
challenge and throughout the 7 hours after the allergen challenge. They calculated
the change in the breathing measurements as percentages.
The researchers found that 7 hours after the allergen challenge, the amount of
air the participants could breathe out in 1 second decreased by an average of:
> 15.2% for the participants who got benralizumab
> 16.3% for the participants who got the placebo
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all
of the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?
There were 8.7% of participants who had adverse reactions during the study.
This was 4 out of 46 participants.
4.3% of participants who got benralizumab had adverse reactions during the
study. This was 1 out of 23 participants.
