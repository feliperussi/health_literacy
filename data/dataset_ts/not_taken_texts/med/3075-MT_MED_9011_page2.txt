Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, also known as COPD. Before a treatment can be approved for patients
to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how a 3-drug inhaler treatment and a
2-drug inhaler treatment acted in the body. The researchers also wanted to find out if
the participants had any medical problems during the study.
In this study, the researchers studied 3 different treatments taken through an inhaler.
One of the treatments was an inhaler treatment that had only glycopyrronium and
formoterol fumarate. The other 2 treatments were different doses of an inhaler
treatment that had budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate. These
2 inhaler treatments are not yet approved in China for COPD patients to take.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• How did the 3-drug treatment and the 2-drug treatment act in the body?
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant took.
All of the participants in the study took either the inhaler treatment that had only
glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate or 1 of the 2 inhaler treatments that had
budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
