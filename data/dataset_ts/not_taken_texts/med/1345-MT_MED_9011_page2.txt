Clinical Trial Results
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in November 2016 and ended in March 2017. It included 18 male
participants at 1 study site in Germany. When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed
the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be given to patients, the company developing it must do research
studies to show that it is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new drug is to test it
in healthy people, or people without any serious health problems.
The study drug, AZD7594, is being developed to treat COPD and asthma. These illnesses can
cause inflammation, or swelling in tissues, in the lungs. This swelling can sometimes make
breathing difficult. Inhalers that contain steroids are used in patients with COPD and asthma
to reduce inflammation. AZD7594 does not contain steroids, but it works in a similar way to
steroids taken by an inhaler.
In this study, researchers compared 3 inhaler treatments that deliver AZD7594 in powder
form. A dose of the study drug was released every time you pressed the inhaler and
breathed in. The same dose of the study drug was used for all 3 treatments. Although the
3 doses were the same, each powder was made up of a different sized particle. A particle
is 1 piece, or granule, of AZD7594 in the powder.
Researchers wanted to know:
• How did AZD7594 act in the body when participants took it in different particle sizes?
• What medical problems did participants have after they took AZD7594?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was an “open-label” study. This means that the study staff and the participants
knew what study drug each participant took.
The study was also a “crossover” study. This means that all participants took the same
treatments but in a random order.
Your study included 18 healthy men who were 25 to 54 years old.
