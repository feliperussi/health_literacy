Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have COVID-19 and
need hospital care. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

The participants in this study took either:
X acalabrutinib and “best supportive care”, also called BSC
X BSC only
What were the results of this study?
