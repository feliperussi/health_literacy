Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in this study
were 39 to 58 years old when they joined.
The study included 6 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart disease. Before a drug can
be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
In people with heart disease, blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen are
narrowed or blocked by the build-up of cholesterol and fats. This can block the
flow of blood to the heart. Serious cases of heart disease can cause heart attacks.
The study drug, AZD5718, was developed to treat heart disease.
In this study, the participants got a single dose of AZD5718. The researchers
wanted to find out how AZD5718 was taken up in the body and how much of it
was found in the participantsâ€™ urine and faeces. Learning how a study drug acts
in the body helps researchers decide what dose to give to participants in future
studies.
