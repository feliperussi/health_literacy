Clinical Study Results
Overall:
• There were 2.6% of infants in the MEDI8897 group who had a LRTI associated with RSV.
This was 25 out of 969 participants.
• There were 9.5% of participants in the placebo group who had a LRTI associated with RSV.
This was 46 out of 484 participants.
Researchers calculated the risk of the participants needing medical attention for a LRTI.
They compared this risk between those that got MEDI8897 or got the placebo.
There was a 70.1% reduction in the risk of having a LRTI associated with RSV that
needed medical attention for participants who got MEDI8897 compared with participants
who got the placebo.
