Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in November 2015 and ended in December 2018. The
researchers stopped the study early because they did not think that MEDI1873 was
helping the participants’ cancer.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants to make
sure they could join the study. This part of the study lasted up to 4 weeks. The
study doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical
problems they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took pictures of each participant’s tumors and their brain using CT or MRI scans
• used surgery for some participants to take a sample of the tumor called a biopsy
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were getting study treatment, they visited their study
site 33 times. The participants got their infusion of MEDI1873 every 2 weeks. This
part of the study lasted for 1 year.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 3
times in the first 3 months. Then, they visited every 3 months after that. This part of
the study lasted for 1 year.
After the second year of visits, the participants could keep visiting their study site
for the study doctors to check their health. This could keep happening every 6
months until the participants’ cancer got worse or they decided to leave the study.
