Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat type 2 diabetes. Before a drug
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either dapagliflozin with saxagliptin and
metformin, or a placebo with saxagliptin and metformin. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did dapagliflozin with saxagliptin and metformin affect the levels of
HbA1c in the participantsâ€™ blood?
HbA1c is a protein in the blood that researchers measure as a way of assessing
blood sugar levels. Because the sponsor decided to stop the study early, the
researchers did not have enough information to compare the HbA1c levels of
the participants. So, they could not answer this question.
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 4.9% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
This was 2 out of 41 participants. More details about the results of this study
are included later in this summary.
