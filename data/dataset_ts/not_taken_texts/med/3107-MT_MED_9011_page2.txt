Clinical Study Results
The researchers in this study wanted to compare the study pain relief patch to another
pain relief patch that had already been approved. They wanted to know if the study
patch worked as well as the approved patch. Both patches contained the same
combination of drugs and the same amount of each drug. But, the patches were made
by different companies. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the study patch reduce injection site pain in participants as well as the
approved patch?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the study
was 22 to 57 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants or the researchers
knew which treatment the participants got. Some studies are done this way because
knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study.
When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants
got so they could create a report of the study results.
There were 3 patches tested in the study:
• the study patch
• the approved patch
• a placebo patch
A placebo patch looks like the study patch but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take the treatment are actually caused by the treatment.
This was also a “crossover” study. This means that each participant got all of the study
treatments, but in a different order.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment order each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
