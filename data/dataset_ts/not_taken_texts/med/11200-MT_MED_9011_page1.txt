Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drugs Studied: AZD7594
Study Title: A study to learn how 2 different forms of AZD7594 act in the body
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD7594. AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the study doctor or staff at your study site.
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants were
18 to 54 years old when they joined.
The study included 24 participants in Germany.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can be approved
for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus.
This makes it difficult to breathe. People who have asthma may wheeze, cough, and
have shortness of breath.
There are treatments that can help people manage their asthma symptoms. But, these
treatments may not help some people control their asthma symptoms. They may also
cause medical problems.
The study drug, AZD7594, is an inhaled asthma treatment. Researchers think that
AZD7594 may help people who have asthma to better manage their symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how AZD7594 acted in the body when
taken through 2 different types of inhalers.
