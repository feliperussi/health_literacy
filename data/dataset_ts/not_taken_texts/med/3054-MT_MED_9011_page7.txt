What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 4 participants who did not get any doses of study treatment, so the
results shown are for 656 out of 660 participants.
Did benralizumab reduce the estimated number of asthma attacks that
the participants would have experienced over 1 year?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab reduced the estimated
number of asthma attacks that the participants would have had over 1 year
compared with the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of asthma attacks
that the participants had during the 24 weeks that they got study treatment. The
participants had an asthma attack if they had worsening symptoms of asthma and
needed any of the following:
X a higher dose of their regular asthma treatment for at least 3 days
X additional medication
X to see a doctor
X to go to the hospital
Then, the researchers calculated the average number of asthma attacks that the
participants had in each treatment group. Finally, the researchers used a math
equation to estimate how many asthma attacks the participants would have had if
they stayed in the study for 1 year.
