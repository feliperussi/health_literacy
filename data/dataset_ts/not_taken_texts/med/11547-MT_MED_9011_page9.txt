What were the results of this trial?
This is a summary of the main results from this trial overall. The individual results
of each participant might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of
the questions that researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites
listed at the end of this summary. When a full report of the trial results is

Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other trials may provide new information or different results.

Did roxadustat affect how much iron got into the participants’ blood
compared with rHuEPO?
No.
To answer this question, the trial doctors gave the participants a dose of liquid
iron. Then, they took blood samples to measure how much of the original
amount of iron got into the participants’ blood 3 hours later.
The researchers did this measurement before the participants received any
treatment, and after 2 weeks of receiving treatment. The researchers calculated
how much this measurement changed after 2 weeks of treatment. Then, they
compared the results between the participants who took roxadustat and the
participants who received rHuEPO.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some differences between the
groups. But, the differences were too small for the researchers to conclude if
roxadustat affected how much iron got into the participants’ blood compared
with rHuEPO.
