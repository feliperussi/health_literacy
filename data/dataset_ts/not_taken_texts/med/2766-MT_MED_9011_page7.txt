Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know if a drug causes a medical problem. So when researchers study
new drugs, they keep track of all the medical problems that participants have during the study.
These problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
During this study, 12 participants (29.3%) had medical problems. No participants left the study
because of medical problems. The table below shows how many participants in each group had
medical problems in this study.

What serious medical problems did participants have?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems,
or requires hospital treatment.
One participant from Group 1 developed aspiration pneumonia, an infection from breathing
food, liquid, or vomit into the lungs. No participants from Group 2 had serious medical
problems during the study. No participants in either group died during the study.
