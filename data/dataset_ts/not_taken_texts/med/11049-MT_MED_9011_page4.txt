What happened during this study?
The study started in July 2019 and ended in September 2020.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors
made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood and urine samples
X took pictures of the participants’ tumors using CT, MRI, PET, or bone scans
X used surgery to take a sample of the tumor, also known as a biopsy
X checked the participants’ heart health using a type of heart scan called a
MUGA scan, an echocardiogram, or an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
X checked how well the participants were able to do their usual daily activities
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the
study.
While the participants were taking study treatment, they visited their
study site 4 times in the first 4 days. During the first visit, the participants took their
dose of AZD4635.
Then, the participants visited their study site 1 or 2 times a week for 7 weeks. After
that, they visited their study site once every 3 weeks until they left the study. The
participants took their dose of AZD4635 once a day until their cancer got worse,
or they decided to stop taking the treatment.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site up
to 2 times. This part of the study lasted for up to 5 weeks. At these visits, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants.
After this, the participants whose cancer did not get any worse at the end of
AZD4635 treatment visited their study site once every 3 months to have their
tumors measured. They visited until their cancer got worse, they started a new
therapy, they left the study, or the researchers ended this study.
