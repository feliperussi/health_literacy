Clinical Study Results
Overview
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat T2DM in young people. Before a drug can be
approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin and a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but
does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did dapagliflozin affect HbA1c levels in the participants’ blood after 24 weeks of
treatment?
No. Researchers measure HbA1c levels as a way of measuring blood sugar levels.
Overall, the researchers found there were some changes in the average HbA1c levels
in the participants who took dapagliflozin and the participants who took the placebo. But,
these changes were not enough for the researchers to know if dapagliflozin affected
HbA1c levels.
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 16.7% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study drug during the study. More details about the medical
problems that the participants had during the study are included later in this summary.
