Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart failure. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
Heart failure is also called congestive heart failure or CHF. It can happen when
certain medical conditions weaken the heart over time. As a result, the heart
cannot pump blood through the body properly, and fluid builds up around the heart.
AZD9977 is being developed as a possible treatment for CHF.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how AZD9977 acted in the blood
when taken alone and when taken with a drug called itraconazole. Itraconazole
is a common treatment used for fungal infections. Participants with CHF in future
studies might take itraconazole at the same time as AZD9977 if they have a fungal
infection. So, the researchers wanted to find out if taking these treatments together
affected how much AZD9977 got into the blood.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much AZD9977 got into the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if AZD9977 improves the health of people with CHF.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the
study was 29 to 55 years old when they joined. The participants had no known
heart or kidney problems.
