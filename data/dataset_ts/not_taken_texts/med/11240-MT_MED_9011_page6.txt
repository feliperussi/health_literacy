questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a report of the study results is available, it can also be
found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant who did not complete the study. So, the results below are
for 4 out of 5 participants.
Did the new apps detect early changes in the participants’ well-being
after their first dose of benralizumab?
Only 4 participants completed the study. So, the researchers were not able to
conclude whether the new apps could detect early changes in the participants’
well-being after they started getting benralizumab.
To answer this question, the researchers calculated scores from the PROACT,
uMotif, and iSpirometry apps for each participant, and measured how these
scores changed during the study. Then, they counted how many participants had
improved scores in all 3 apps in the first 2 weeks after getting benralizumab.
Because the study ended early, the researchers could not draw any conclusions
from the results.
How did the new apps compare with existing methods to measure
well-being and asthma symptoms?
Only 4 participants completed the study. So, the researchers were not able to
determine how the new apps compared with the existing methods.
To answer this question, the researchers compared the participants’ scores
from the PROACT, uMotif, and iSpirometry apps with their scores from the
questionnaires they answered during the study. These were:
> 6-Item Asthma Control Questionnaire, also called ACQ-6
> St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, also called SGRQ
