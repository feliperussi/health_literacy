Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
In the table below, the results for all participants who got AZD4076 are grouped
together.
AZD4076 Placebo
(out of 8 participants) (out of 6 participants)
How many participants had
87.5% (7) 83.3% (5)
adverse events?
How many participants had
12.5% (1) 0.0% (0)
serious adverse events?
How many participants
stopped getting study
12.5% (1) 0.0% (0)
treatment due to adverse
events?
The only serious adverse event that happened was chest discomfort.
The most common adverse events were diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, and
increased levels of a liver protein called ALT. The participant who had increased
levels of ALT stopped getting study treatment.
The researchers also wanted to learn if the participants had a reaction when they
received the injection of the study treatment. Other studies with AZD4076 showed
that the participants in those studies had a reaction where they were injected.
The researchers found that in this study:
X 25.0% of the participants who got AZD4076 had a reaction where they were
injected. This was 2 out of 8 participants.
X 16.7% of the participants who got the placebo had a reaction where they
were injected. This was 1 out of 6 participants.
