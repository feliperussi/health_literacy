Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with HFpEF. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD4831 works in a small
number of participants with HFpEF. They also wanted to find out if the participants
had any medical problems during the study.
HFpEF happens when the heart can pump normally or nearly normally but
becomes too stiff to fill properly. This means that blood collects in the lungs and in
the rest of the body.
Heart failure is a long-lasting condition that can cause symptoms such as shortness
of breath, tiredness, and swelling of certain tissues. In serious cases of heart
failure, there is an increased risk of other heart problems, and of death.
The study drug, AZD4831, was designed to reduce the activity of a protein called
MPO. High amounts of MPO in the blood can be a sign of inflammation of the
heart or the blood vessels. High amounts of MPO in the blood can be linked to an
increased chance of having severe heart problems or problems with blood moving
through the body. Researchers think reducing the activity of MPO in people with
HFpEF may mean they have less risk of severe heart problems.
