Treatment group Treatment group
During Part A, AZD5634 was quickly taken up into the blood after it was breathed in. AZD5634
first started to leave the blood quickly, but then slowed down in leaving the blood, especially in
participants who got the higher doses.
During Part B, AZD5634 left the blood very quickly when given through the infusion. During Part B,
about 3% of the AZD5634 reached the blood when breathed in.
