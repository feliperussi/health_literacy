What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What adverse events of special interest did the participants have during the
study?
X What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if durvalumab helps improve the health of people with cancer of
the urinary tract that has spread.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got durvalumab. It was given slowly through a
needle in a vein under the skin, also known as an “IV infusion”.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The participants continued to get durvalumab for as long as the study doctors
thought it was helping them or until the participants left the study.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
