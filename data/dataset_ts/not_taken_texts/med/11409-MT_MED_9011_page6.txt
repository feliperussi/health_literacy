Clinical Study Results
Did GP MDI affect the amount of air the participants could breathe out?
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of air the
participants breathed out in 1 second. They did this 15 minutes after the participants
took their treatment as well as their regular asthma inhaler. The study doctors
repeated this measurement 4 times during the first 4 hours after the participants
took their treatment. The researchers then calculated the average amount of air that
was breathed out. This was measured in liters, also called L. They compared the
amount breathed out after 24 weeks of treatment to the amount breathed out before
the participants started treatment.
The researchers found that in each treatment group, the participants could
breathe out more air after 24 weeks of treatment. This amount increased more
in the participants who took 7.2 μg of GP MDI compared to the participants who
took the placebo. But, the differences between the other GP MDI treatment
groups and the placebo were too small for the researchers to know for sure if GP
MDI affected the participants’ breathing.
The researchers found that after 24 weeks of taking study treatment:
• The participants taking 28.8 μg of GP MDI breathed out an average of 0.294 L
more air than they did at the start of the study.
• The participants taking 14.4 μg of GP MDI breathed out an average of 0.284 L
more air than they did at the start of the study.
• The participants taking 7.2 μg of GP MDI breathed out an average of 0.308 L
more air than they did at the start of the study.
• The participants taking the placebo breathed out an average of 0.240 L more
air than they did at the start of the study.
• The participants taking 2.5 μg of Spiriva Respimat breathed out an average of
0.347 L more air than they did at the start of the study.
