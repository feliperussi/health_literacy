Clinical Study Results
• Less than 0.1% of the participants who took GFF MDI died from serious adverse reactions.
This was 2 out of 2,125 participants.
• Less than 0.1% of the participants who took BFF MDI died from serious adverse reactions.
This was 1 out of 2,136 participants.
What adverse reactions happened during this study?
The most common adverse reaction was a yeast infection around the mouth.
The table below shows the adverse reactions that happened in 0.5% or more of participants.
This means they happened in at least 1 out of every 200 participants. There were other adverse
reactions, but these happened in fewer participants.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how BGF MDI affected symptoms compared to
GFF MDI and BFF MDI in participants with COPD.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with BGF MDI, GFF MDI, and BFF MDI are planned.
