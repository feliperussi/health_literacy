Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat high levels of LDL cholesterol.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
LDL cholesterol is a fatty substance in the blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol
can lead to clogged blood vessels, also known as “atherosclerosis”. This can
cause disease in the heart or blood vessels, and increase the risk of stroke, heart
attack, and other heart problems.
People with high levels of LDL cholesterol are usually given drugs called “statins”.
But statin treatment does not lead to low enough levels of LDL cholesterol in
many people.
Many factors can affect the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. One factor is a
protein called “PCSK9” that can raise the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. A
previous study in healthy volunteers showed that AZD8233 lowered the levels of
PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol in blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if different doses of AZD8233
reduced LDL cholesterol in the blood compared with placebo. They also wanted
to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How much did the different doses of AZD8233 reduce LDL cholesterol in the
blood compared with placebo?
X What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD8233 helps improve the health of people with high levels
of LDL cholesterol.
