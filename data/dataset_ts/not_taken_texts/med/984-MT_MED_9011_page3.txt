Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination of the participants
• checked the height, weight, blood sugar levels, and body fat levels of
the participants
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram,
also known as an ECG
• did a body scan called a Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry, or DXA scan,
to measure the amount of body fat of the participants
• did a scan called a computed tomography, or CT scan, on the abdomen
to measure the amount of fat in the abdomen
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site 5 times over the course
of 1 year. At these visits, the doctors checked the weight, blood sugar levels, and
body fat levels, and overall health of the participants.
Over the course of the study, the participants took either:
• dapagliflozin and metformin once a day
• glimepiride and metformin once a day
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site again for a
follow-up visit. During this visit, the doctors checked the health of the participants
again and asked how they were feeling.
