How did MEDI4166 affect the blood sugar levels in participants?
Researchers compared the change in the blood sugar levels of participants from the beginning
of the study to Day 36 of the study for both Part A and Part B. When the data were analyzed,
researchers found that:
Part A
In Part A, participants who got the different MEDI4166 doses had a decrease in their blood
sugar levels, but researchers did not think these results were significant.
Part B
In Part B, participants who got the different MEDI4166 doses had a decrease in their blood
sugar levels, but researchers did not think these results were significant.
• Participants who got 50 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in blood sugar of
195.6 milligram hours per deciliter of blood, or mg-h/dL
• Participants who got 200 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in blood sugar of
76.2 mg-h/dL
• Participants who got 400 mg of MEDI4166 had an average decrease in blood sugar of
46.7 mg-h/dL
• Participants who got the placebo had an average decrease in blood sugar of 87.1 mg-h/dL
