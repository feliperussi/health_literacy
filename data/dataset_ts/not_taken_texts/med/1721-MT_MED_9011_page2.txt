Clinical Trial Results
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in December 2015 and ended in January 2017. The study included
48 participants at 8 study sites in the United States. When the study ended, the sponsor
reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be approved, research must be done to show that it is safe
and effective.
The study drug, MEDI6012, is being developed to treat coronary artery disease, or
CAD. CAD is a heart disease that can cause damage to the major blood vessels of the
heart. MEDI6012 was developed to reduce the buildup of cholesterol in blood vessels,
including the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This may help decrease the
chance of having a heart attack.
In this study, researchers compared 2 different forms of MEDI6012. One form was an IV
treatment of MEDI6012. An IV treatment is a treatment given in a vein through a needle.
The other form was an injection treatment of MEDI6012 under the skin.
Researchers also compared these 2 forms of MEDI6012 to a placebo. A placebo looks like
the study drug but contains no real medicine. Researchers use a placebo so that they can
compare the results of participants who take study drugs with the results of participants
who take no medicine at all.
Researchers wanted to know:
• Did MEDI6012 increase the amount of good cholesterol in participants’
blood more than the placebo?
• How did MEDI6012 act in the body?
• What medical problems did participants have after getting MEDI6012?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
researchers, or staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting can affect the
results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly.
