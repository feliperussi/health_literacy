What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers
asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the
results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest
for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD7986 are currently planned.
How did AZD7986 act in the body when taken by itself versus when taken
with other drugs?
Researchers took blood samples to compare the effects of AZD7986 taken
alone with the effects of AZD7986 taken with either verapamil or itraconazole.
They looked primarily at two different things:
• the amount of the study drugs that reached the blood
• the highest amount of the study drugs in the blood over time
