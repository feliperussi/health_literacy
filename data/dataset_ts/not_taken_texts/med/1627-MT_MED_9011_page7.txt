Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical
problem. So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of
all medical problems that participants have during the study. These medical
problems are also called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused
by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems?
In this study, 2 of the 10 participants (20%) had a total of 3 medical
problems. Researchers thought that one participant’s medical problem
(diarrhoea) was related to the study drug. No participants stopped taking
the study drug because of medical problems.
What were the most common medical problems in the study?
The most common medical problems were:
• Cough
• Diarrhoea
• Pain in the muscles and/or joints
All 3 medical problems were considered mild, which means that the
participants were aware of the medical problems but could easily tolerate
them. One participant had a cough, which was resolved after 8 days, and
diarrhoea, which was resolved after 1 day. One participant had pain in his
or her muscles and/or joints, which was resolved after 2 days.
How many participants in this study had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or a participant needs hospital care.
No participants had serious medical problems in this study.
