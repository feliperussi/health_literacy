What medical problems happened during
this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for cotadutide.
