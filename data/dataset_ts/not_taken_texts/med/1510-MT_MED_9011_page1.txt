Thank you!
As a clinical study participant, you belong to a large community of participants around
the world. You help researchers answer important health questions and discover new
medical treatments.
Thank you for taking part in this clinical study for the vaccine MEDI7510. Researchers
were developing this vaccine to prevent illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus,
also called RSV. This virus causes an illness similar to the flu in people of all ages. You
and all of the other participants helped the researchers learn if MEDI7510 was effective
in preventing illness caused by RSV, and if it caused any medical problems.
MedImmune, LLC, the sponsor of this study, thanks you for your help and thinks it
is important for you to know the results of your study. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the study results for you with
the help of a medical writing organization.
We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical
research. If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctors or staff
at your study site.
