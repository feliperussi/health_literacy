Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with advanced solid tumors
who also have damaged kidneys. “Advanced” means that the cancer cells have spread to
other parts of the body. A solid tumor is a type of cancer that can form in different organs
in the body.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how osimertinib acts in the bodies of
participants who had advanced solid tumors and damaged or healthy kidneys. The
researchers also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during
the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Was the amount of osimertinib in the blood similar for participants with damaged
kidneys and participants with healthy kidneys?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out how osimertinib should be taken by patients with damaged kidneys.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid tumors. The
participants in the study were 59 to 88 years old when they joined.
Some of the participants had damaged kidneys, and some had healthy kidneys. When
the study started, there were 7 participants with damaged kidneys and 9 participants with
healthy kidneys.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was taking.
All of the participants took osimertinib. They took it as a pill by mouth. Each dose of
osimertinib was measured in milligrams, also called mg.
What happened during the study?
Before participants took osimertinib, the doctors did tests and exams to make sure
they could join the study. The doctors checked the participants’ tumors, kidneys, and
overall health.
