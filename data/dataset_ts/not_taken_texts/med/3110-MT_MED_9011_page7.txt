The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study. The
olaparib and adavosertib group had fewer participants than the other 2 groups
because it was stopped earlier, due to a high number of medical problems.

The doctors could reduce the dose of the participantsâ€™ assigned treatments if they
had any medical problems during the study. The participants took their assigned
treatments until their cancer got worse, until the study doctors thought they
should stop study treatment, or until they left the study for another reason.
