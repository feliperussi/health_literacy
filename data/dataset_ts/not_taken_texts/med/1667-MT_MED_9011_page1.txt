Thank you!
Thank you to the caregivers who allowed their infants to take part in the clinical trial for
the study drug MEDI8897. You helped researchers learn more about using MEDI8897 to
help prevent serious lung infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus in prematurely
born infants. Respiratory syncytial virus is also known as RSV.
MedImmune sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the
study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your childâ€™s important role in medical research.
If your child participated in the study and you have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
