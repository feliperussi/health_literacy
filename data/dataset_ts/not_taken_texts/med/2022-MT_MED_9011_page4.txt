Clinical Study Results
During Part 2, the participants visited their study site up to 9 times over the course of
about 4 weeks. During this time period, the participants took 1 of the below treatments
once a day by mouth:
• 5 g of ZS powder with water
• 10 g of ZS powder with water
• a placebo powder with water
After taking ZS or the placebo in Part 2, the participants visited their study site
2 more times so the doctors could check their health and potassium levels.
The chart below shows how Part 2 of the study was done.

What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary. More information about the questions
the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this
summary. A full report of the study results may also be available on these websites.
Researchers usually need the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did ZS help keep potassium levels normal?
Yes. Overall in Part 2, the researchers found that more participants who took ZS had their
potassium stay at normal levels compared to the participants who took the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers studied the potassium levels of the participants
in Part 2. These participants had high potassium levels at the beginning of the study, but
their potassium had reached normal levels before they entered Part 2.
