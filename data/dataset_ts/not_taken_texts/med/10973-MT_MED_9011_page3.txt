What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if MEDI7247 can help improve the health of people with
advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants in this study got MEDI7247 through a needle into a vein.
This is known as an intravenous infusion, also known as an IV infusion.
The study was planned to happen in 2 parts. Both parts were to be “open-label”.
This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew
what each participant was getting.
Part 1 was done so the researchers could find which dose to give to the
participants in Part 2. There were 8 participants in Part 1. The researchers planned
to have around 5 groups of participants in Part 1. But, there were only enough
participants for 2 groups. Each group got a different dose of MEDI7247. Each
participant received the same dose throughout this part of the study.
In Part 2 it was planned that all of the participants would take the same dose
of MEDI7247 based on the results from Part 1. But, this part of the study did not
happen because the researchers ended the study early.
