This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work

Did the participants taking AZD9496 have fewer oestrogen receptors on
their tumours than the participants getting fulvestrant?
To help answer this question, the study doctors took tumour biopsies before and
after the participants got study treatment. The researchers compared the amount of
oestrogen receptors on the participantsâ€™ tumours in the tumour samples. They did
this for 15 participants in the AZD9496 group and 20 participants in the fulvestrant
group who had samples analysed.
The researchers found that in both treatment groups there were fewer oestrogen
receptors in the biopsy samples after getting treatment.
But, the participants who got AZD9496 did not have fewer oestrogen receptors on
their tumours than the participants who got fulvestrant.
