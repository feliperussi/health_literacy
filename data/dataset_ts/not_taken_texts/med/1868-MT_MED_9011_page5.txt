Treatment (µg)
Change in how much air participants could exhale 6 hours after treatment on Day 1 and
Day 7 of a treatment visit
Researchers measured how much air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1 of each
treatment visit, several times within 6 hours of getting treatment, and again 6 hours after treatment on
Day 1 and Day 7. Then, researchers compared those 2 amounts.
6 hours after treatment on Day 1
Compared with the amounts of air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1, within 6 hours
after treatment:
• Participants who took 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.11 more liters of air
• Participants who took 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.15 more liters of air
• Participants who took 24 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.21 more liters of air
• Participants who took 20 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer exhaled 0.20 more liters of air
• Participants who took 40 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer exhaled 0.25 more liters of air
• Participants who took the placebo exhaled 0.02 less liters of air
6 hours after treatment on Day 7
Compared with the amounts of air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 7, 6 hours
after treatment:
• Participants who took 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.17 more liters of air
• Participants who took 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.18 more liters of air
• Participants who took 24 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.23 more liters of air
• Participants who took 20 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer exhaled 0.19 more liters of air
• Participants who took the placebo exhaled 0.01 more liters of air
