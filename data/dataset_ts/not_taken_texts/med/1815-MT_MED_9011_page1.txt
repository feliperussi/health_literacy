Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca
Drug Studied: AZD1775
Study Title: A study to learn how different doses of AZD1775 affect
patients with solid tumors, and if AZD1775 is safe to take
Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD1775. All of the participants and their family members helped researchers
learn more about AZD1775 to help people with solid tumors.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants, their families, and the public. An independent
non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results. We hope it helps the participants and their families understand and feel
proud of their important role in medical research.
If you or your family member participated in the study and have questions about
the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at the study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in December 2015 and ended in April 2018. The study included
62 participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with solid tumors.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out if it works and how safe it is.
