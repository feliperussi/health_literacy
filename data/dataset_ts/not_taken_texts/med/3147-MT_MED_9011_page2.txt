Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease
in people having coronary artery bypass graft surgery, also called “CABG”
surgery. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got AZD8601 or a placebo as several
injections into the heart during CABG surgery. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during
the study?
Overall, the researchers found that from the start of the study, there
were some small changes in the results of the participants’ health
tests and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these
changes to be meaningful.
X What medical problems did the participants have during
this study?
None of the participants had any serious adverse reactions, or
adverse reactions that resulted in death.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this
summary.
