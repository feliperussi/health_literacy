Thank you!
As a clinical study participant, you belong to a large community of
participants around the world. You help researchers answer important health
questions and discover new medical treatments.
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drug Symbicort®. This
is an approved drug that is taken in an inhaler to treat asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD. Symbicort is a combination
of 2 drugs, budesonide and formoterol. You and all of the participants helped
researchers learn if a single dose of Symbicort can help improve heart
function. Researchers wanted to test this dose to see how much oxygen the
body uses at rest when a person with COPD takes Symbicort. Researchers also
wanted to see if this dose causes medical problems.
AstraZeneca, the sponsor of this study, thanks you for your help and thinks
it is important for you to know the results of your study. An independent
non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the study
results for you with the help of a medical writing organization. We hope
it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical
research. If you have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
