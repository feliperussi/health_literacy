Clinical Trial Results
What happened during the study?
The study lasted 16 weeks for some participants and 28 weeks for other
participants. There were 12 weeks of treatment during the 16-week study and
24 weeks of treatment during the 28-week study. Participants visited their study
center up to 5 times. Of the 110 participants:
• 38 completed the 16-week study
• 63 completed the 28-week study
• 9 did not complete either study. Some of these participants
completed enough of the study to be included in the results.
To see if you could join the study, study doctors did a physical examination and
checked your pulse, blood pressure, and weight. They also took blood and urine
samples for tests. One blood test was to check your blood sugar levels. Study
doctors also asked about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what
medicines you were taking.
All participants got 2 milligrams, or mg, of exenatide, given in a needle, once a
week. During the study, there were:
• 4 visits for participants in the 16-week study
• 5 visits for participants in the 28-week study
During the study, your study doctor examined you regularly. This included asking
about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were
taking. The study doctor also did a physical examination and checked your pulse,
blood pressure, weight, and blood sugar level. You gave blood and urine samples
for tests.
The study doctor or staff also called participants 3 times in the 28-week study and
once in the 16-week study.
There were 4 weeks in between the first and second treatment visits. There were
8 weeks in between the second and third treatment visits.
During the 28-week study, there were 12 weeks in between the third and fourth
treatment visits.
About 4 weeks after the end of the entire study, the study doctor or staff called
you again to see how you were feeling.
