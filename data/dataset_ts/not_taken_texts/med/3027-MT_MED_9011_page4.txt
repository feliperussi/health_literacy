Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer of the urinary tract that has
spread outside the urinary tract. Before a treatment can be approved for people
to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of durvalumab
in a large number of participants with cancer of the urinary tract that has spread.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. When cancer progresses to a late stage, tumors
spread to other parts of the body or grow outside the organ where they started.
Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing. But, in some
people with cancer of the urinary tract, proteins on the tumor cells can interact
with certain proteins on the immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from
recognizing the tumor cells and being able to attack them.
The study treatment, durvalumab, was designed to stop the tumor cells from
interacting with some of these proteins.
