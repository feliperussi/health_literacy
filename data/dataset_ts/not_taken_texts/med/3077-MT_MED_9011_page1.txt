Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
MEDI0382. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about MEDI0382 to
help people who already have kidney damage.
MedImmune, Ltd. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 8 weeks. But, the entire study took
about 6 months to finish.
The study started in October 2017 and ended in April 2018. It included 37 participants in
Germany and New Zealand.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who already have kidney
damage. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how well MEDI0382 reaches the blood in
people who already have kidney damage. They also wanted to find out if the participants
had any medical problems during the study.
The study drug, MEDI0382, is being developed to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
