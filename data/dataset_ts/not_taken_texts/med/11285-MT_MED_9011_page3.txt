Clinical Study Results
What happened during this study?
Before this study started, the participants visited their study site twice over the course of
4 weeks to make sure they could join the study. During this time, the doctors:
• did a physical examination of the participants
• checked the participants’ lung function by having participants blow into a mouth piece
connected to a meter that measures the amount of air they can force out of their lungs
• checked the participants’ heart health by doing a test called an electrocardiogram, or ECG
• took blood samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history
• asked the participants how they were feeling
• learned what medicines the participants were taking
• asked the participants to stop taking most of their own medicines to treat COPD
During this study, the participants visited their study site 6 times and had phone calls 5 times.
During this time, the participants had their lung function tested and completed surveys. They took
either 2 different doses of budesonide and formoterol fumarate together or formoterol fumarate
by itself twice a day. Doses were measured in micrograms, or µg for short.
• 624 participants took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together
• 627 participants took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together
• 613 participants took 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate only
The participants could also use rescue medicines provided by the study doctor if they needed
it. A rescue medicine is a quick-acting medicine that could be used if COPD symptoms became
severe.
At the end of this study, the doctors called the participants and asked how they were feeling
and learned what medicines the participants were taking since their last dose of study medicine.
