Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI0382. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about MEDI0382 to
help patients with type 2 diabetes.
MedImmune Limited sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for about 4.5 months. But, the entire study took about
5 months to finish.
The study started in September 2017 and ended in January 2018. It included 65
participants in Germany.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
