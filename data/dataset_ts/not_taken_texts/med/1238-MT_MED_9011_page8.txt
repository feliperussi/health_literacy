Thank you
It is said that the greatest gift is one which is given
anonymously, giving when you do not know whether
you will get direct personal benefit.
This is the gift that you have given by taking part in a clinical trial.
It is a brave and selfless act, one that advances medical knowledge
and benefits public health.
Thank you for the gift of your participation in clinical research.
