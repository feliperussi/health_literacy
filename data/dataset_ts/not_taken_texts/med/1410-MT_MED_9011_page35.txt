What treatments did the participants get
during Part 4?
Participants could enter Part 4 of the study if they had not had any therapy that
works throughout the whole body, also called a systemic therapy, for their HCC
before. There were 47 participants in Part 4. All of the participants got durvalumab
and bevacizumab. The participants continued getting study treatment until they
left the study or until the study doctors thought it was no longer helping them.
Part 4 was “open-label”. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors,
and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
Durvalumab and bevacizumab were each given as an injection into a vein, also
called an IV infusion. The doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of body
weight, also known as “mg/kg”.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study in Part 4.
