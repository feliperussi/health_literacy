Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking.
In this study, the participants took savolitinib or sunitinib as a pill by mouth. The
doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
There were 2 treatment groups in this study. A computer program was used to
randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the
groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
treatment is as accurate as possible.
In this study, the participants took study treatment in 6-week time periods called
“cycles”. The participants could keep taking study treatment until one of these
happened:
• their cancer got worse
• they had a medical problem that the doctors thought might be related to the
study treatment
• they wanted to leave the study
