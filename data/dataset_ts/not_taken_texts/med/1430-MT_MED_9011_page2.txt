Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer, also called ES-SCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to
get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Sometimes researchers do a study of a drug in a small number of participants to
decide if they should do a similar study in a larger number of participants.
This small study had 3 groups of participants. Each group got a different
treatment. This summary shows the results from Group 1. The results from
Groups 2 and 3 are in different summaries.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in Group 1 of this study got durvalumab with tremelimumab.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for Group 1 in this study
were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participantsâ€™ tumors?
Some participants in Group 1 had tumors that shrank after they got
durvalumab and tremelimumab. But, the overall number of participants
whose tumors shrank was small.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 46.3% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
The most common medical problem was high levels of thyroid hormones.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
