formoterol fumarate fumarate and budesonide only fumarate and
only using MDI budesonide using TBH using MDI budesonide using TBH
(320 µg budesonide + 9.6 µg formoterol fumarate) (320 µg budesonide + 9.6 µg formoterol fumarate)
before taking a treatment dose over the 4 hours after taking a treatment dose
The participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had more increased lung function over the
4 hours after taking a treatment dose compared with participants who took
budesonide by itself using MDI. They were able to exhale an average of 165 mL
more air than participants who took budesonide by itself using MDI.
The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to know
if participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had more increased lung function before taking a treatment
dose than participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
