Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. At this visit, the doctors checked their overall health to make sure they could
join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems
• took blood and urine samples
• tested the health of the participants’ hearts using an electrocardiogram and an
echocardiogram
• During the study, the doctors gave the participants their study treatment to
take at home. The participants each took 1 tablet a day at home for about 17
months. They visited their study site 5 times in the first 8 months, and then
once every 4 months until they left the study. At most visits, the participants
answered a questionnaire about their symptoms. The doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood and urine samples
• asked the participants about any health problems or any medications they were
taking
When the participants took the last dose of study treatment, they visited
the study site 1 more time. At this visit, the participants answered a questionnaire
about their symptoms. The doctors:
