Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat a type of eczema called atopic
dermatitis, also known as AD. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study. This information is important to know before other
studies can be done that help find out if MEDI9314 improves the health of people
with AD.
