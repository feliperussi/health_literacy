Washout period of 14 days
between the 2 treatment visits
During the study, doctors checked the blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate
of each participant. Study doctors checked the levels of oxygen in the blood of each participant.
Study doctors also tested the blood and urine to make sure that participants were still healthy and
to see how AZD5634 was acting in the blood. Study doctors also asked participants how they were
feeling. Finally, study doctors checked both the heart and lung health of each participant.
For both Part A and Part B, participants had a follow-up visit 7 to 10 days after their last treatment,
and then a final follow-up visit 2 months after their last treatment visit.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during the study. It
is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines
work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD5634 are currently planned.
What medical problems did participants have during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So, researchers keep
track of all medical problems that participants have during the study. These medical problems are
called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
The tables below and on the next page show how many participants in both Part A and Part B had
medical problems. No participants stopped taking the study drug because of a medical problem.
