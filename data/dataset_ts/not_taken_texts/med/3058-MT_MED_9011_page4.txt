How the study was done
Who took part in this study? Two different doses in this study
• Dose A:
One combined 200/300-milligram
(mg) tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol
• There were 28 participants in this study. given with food.
• They were all healthy adults between the • Dose B:
ages of 18 and 65. One 200-mg tablet of lesinurad and
one 300-mg tablet of allopurinol
given with food.
• The order that the doses were taken was
different for each group.
• Each participant took Dose A twice and
• All the participants visited 1 study site. Dose B twice.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked
during the study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of
many studies to decide which doses work the best and are the safest for patients.
Further clinical studies with lesinurad and allopurinol are currently planned.
Did similar amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol stay in participants’ blood
when taken with food as 1 combined tablet compared to separate tablets?
Overall, researchers found that participants had about the same amounts of
lesinurad and allopurinol in their blood no matter which dose they took. The
highest amount of each drug in the participants blood was also about the same
no matter which dose they took.
