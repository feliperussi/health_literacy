Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in August 2016 and ended in January 2020.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site at
least 1 time within the 4-week period before the start of study treatment. At this
visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants to make sure they
could join the study. The study doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors
using CT or MRI scans. These are also known as computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging scans. They also:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical
problems they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got MEDI9090, they visited their study site 9 times.
Every 4 weeks, the participants got an infusion of MEDI9090. The study doctors
checked to see if the participants’ tumors were shrinking about every 8 weeks.
While the participants got durvalumab, they visited their study site once
every 4 weeks. At these visits, the participants got an infusion of durvalumab. The
study doctors checked to see if the participants’ tumors were shrinking about every
8 to 16 weeks.
After the participants stopped getting study treatment, they visited their
study site once a month for 3 months. At these visits, the study doctors checked
the participants’ health and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having.
