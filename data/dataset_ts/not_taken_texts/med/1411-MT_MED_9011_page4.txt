Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in July 2016 and ended in February 2019.
The researchers ended the study early. This was because they found that the study
treatments were only helping a small number of the participants with their cancer.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time
during a 1 month period. During this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure
the participants could join the study.
The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants got treatment in 4-week periods called “cycles”.
The participants could start a new cycle until either their cancer got worse or they
had medical problems that caused them to stop taking study treatment. If the
study treatment was helping the participants’ cancer at the end of the study, the
participants could choose to continue treatment.
The participants in Part A received up to 4 treatment cycles for up to 4 months.
The participants in Part B received up to 4 treatment cycles for up to 4 months.
Throughout the study, the researchers continued checking the participants’ health.
After the participants got their last treatment, they visited their study site about
once a month for 3 months. Then, they visited their study site:
• once every 3 months for about 9 months
• once every 6 months for up to about another 12 months
At these visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ health and asked them
how they were feeling. If the participants were not healthy enough to visit their
study site, the study doctors called to ask the participants how they were feeling.
