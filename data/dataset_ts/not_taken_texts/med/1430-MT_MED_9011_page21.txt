Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with ES-SCLC who had
already received chemotherapy that was no longer helping their cancer. The
participants in Group 3 of this study were 34 to 76 years old when they joined.
Group 3 included 21 participants in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and Ukraine.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have ES-SCLC.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
For Group 3 of this study, the researchers wanted to find out how ceralasertib
with olaparib worked in a small number of participants with ES-SCLC. If the drugs
worked well, the researchers planned to do a similar study in a larger number of
participants. The participants in this study had received chemotherapy that was no
longer helping their cancer. The researchers also wanted to find out what medical
problems the participants had during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. When cancer reaches the “extensive stage”, tumors can
spread to other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started.
Sometimes there are too many tumors, or they are too difficult to remove by
surgery. This is also called “advanced” cancer.
The study drugs, ceralasertib and olaparib, were each designed to damage the
DNA of the tumor cells. This causes the tumor cells to die.
For Group 3 of this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well ceralasertib
and olaparib worked together in these participants.
