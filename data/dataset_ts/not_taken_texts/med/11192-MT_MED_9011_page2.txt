Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat participants with long-standing,
severe COPD. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took both:
X budesonide and formoterol fumarate through a metered dose
inhaler, also known as BFF MDI
X budesonide and formoterol fumarate through a dry powder inhaler,
also known as BFF DPI
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did BFF MDI affect how much air the participants could breathe
out compared with BFF DPI?
Overall, BFF delivered through either an MDI or a DPI increased the amount
of air the participants could breathe out. The researchers found that the MDI
and DPI worked equally well, and did not find a difference between the MDI
and DPI in the amount of air the participants could breathe out.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this
study?
None of the participants had medical problems that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
