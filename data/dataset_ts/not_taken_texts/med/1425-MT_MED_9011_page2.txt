Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced or metastatic
NSCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got either:
X durvalumab together with tremelimumab
X standard treatment, which was chemotherapy
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab together with tremelimumab help the
participants live longer compared with standard treatment?
In the Global group, which included participants from across the
world: No. The researchers found that there were some differences
in how long the participants lived when comparing the durvalumab
and tremelimumab combined treatment with the standard treatment.
But, the difference between the 2 groups was too small for the
researchers to know if durvalumab together with tremelimumab
affected how long the participants lived.
In the China Group, which included participants from China who
joined the study later than participants in the Global group: Overall,
the researchers found that there were some differences in how long
the participants lived after getting durvalumab with tremelimumab or
standard treatment. But, the number of participants was too small for
the researchers to know if durvalumab together with tremelimumab
affected how long the participants lived.
