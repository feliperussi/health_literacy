Clinical Study Results
What’s happened since this study ended?
This study started in September 2015 and ended in November 2016. It included
1894 participants at 60 study sites in Canada, Chile, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
South Africa, and the United States.
When this study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before patients can get a new vaccine, the company developing the vaccine must
do research studies to show that it is safe and effective.
The study vaccine, MEDI7510, was being developed to prevent illness caused by
respiratory syncytial virus, also called RSV. This virus can cause lung infections. The
symptoms of RSV are usually mild, like a common cold, but they can be severe in
infants and older adults.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if MEDI7510 is effective at preventing
illness caused by RSV, and if MEDI7510 causes any medical problems.
The researchers in this study compared an injected dose of MEDI7510 to an injected
dose of a placebo. A placebo looks like a vaccine but does not contain any real
medicine. Researchers use a placebo to compare the results for participants who
get study vaccines with the results for participants who get no vaccine at all. In this
study, the placebo was just an injection of salt water.
The researchers in this study wanted to know:
• How effective was the vaccine in preventing diseases caused by RSV?
• How did the participants’ immune systems respond to MEDI7510?
• What medical problems did the participants have?
What kind of study was this?
This study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment each participant gets can affect the
results of the study.
This study included 1894 participants. All of the participants were 60 years of age
or older.
