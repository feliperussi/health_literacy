Did cediranib and olaparib shrink the participants’ tumors?
To answer this question, the study doctors took pictures of the participants’
tumors using CT or MRI scans. The study doctors measured the size of the
participants’ tumors before they took study treatment and throughout the study.
To do this, they used a set of rules called Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors, also called RECIST.
The researchers calculated the percentage of participants whose tumors shrank.
This percentage of participants needed to be at least 20% for the researchers to
conclude that cediranib and olaparib shrank the tumors in a meaningful way.
Out of the 62 participants in the study, there were 2 participants who did not take
study treatment and 1 participant who did not meet the criteria to be included in
this calculation. For this reason, the results below include 59 participants.
