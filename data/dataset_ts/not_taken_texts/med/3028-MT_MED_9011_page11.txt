The researchers also did these measurements at 2 different times, in April 2019
and in March 2020. When the researchers looked at the results in April 2019, they
compared the participants who got durvalumab with chemotherapy with those
who got chemotherapy alone.
The table below shows the average change in the participants’ scores for each
main symptom in April 2019. A bigger change in score means that the symptoms
got better.
Average change in score over 1 year for each main symptom in April 2019

Fatigue 7.4 5.6
Shortness of breath 8.6 8.0
Cough 17.1 17.1
Low appetite 12.7 8.2
Chest pain 8.1 9.4
When the researchers looked at the results in March 2020, they compared the
participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy with
those who got chemotherapy alone. A bigger change in score means that the
symptoms got better.
The table below shows the average change in the participants’ scores for each
main symptom in March 2020.
