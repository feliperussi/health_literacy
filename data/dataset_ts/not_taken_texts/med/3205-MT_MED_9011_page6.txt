Clinical Study Results
Throughout both parts of the study, the study doctors checked the participants’
health and body weight and asked them how they were feeling. The study doctors
also kept track of how many calories the participants took in and burned off.
During Part 1, the participants visited their study site up to 3 times over the
course of about 2 weeks. During this part, all of the participants were given a
placebo injection once a day.
After Part 1 ended, the participants started Part 2.
Some of the participants left the study during Part 1 before they received any of the
study drug MEDI0382. So, only 25 participants started Part 2.
During Part 2, the participants visited their study site up to 5 times over the
course of about 6 weeks. During this part, the participants were given an injection
of either MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day.
During Part 2, the participants also exercised on a stationary bicycle, and then
rested. The study doctors used a machine, called a calorimeter, to measure how
many calories the participants burned off overall, during exercise, and during rest.
About 1 month after being given their last treatment, the participants
visited their study site 1 more time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the
participants’ health and body weight and asked them how they were feeling.
