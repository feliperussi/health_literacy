Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in October 2013 and ended in September 2019.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This
happened about 4 weeks before the participants got study treatment. At this visit, the study
doctors made sure that the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems
they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took pictures of each participant’s tumor using an MRI scan
• if needed, did a procedure called a biopsy to take a sample of the participants’ tumors
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were getting study treatment in Part A, the participants visited
their study site up to about 35 times based on which group they were in.
At each of these visits, the participants got their IV infusions of MEDI4736. At some of these
visits, they got IV infusions of tremelimumab.
While the participants were getting study treatment in Part B, they visited their
study site up to about 23 times. At each of these visits, the participants got their IV infusions of
MEDI4736. At some of these visits, they got IV infusions of tremelimumab.
After the participants got their last study treatment, they visited their study site 6
times over 12 months. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
After that, the study doctors called the participants every 3 months until the study ended. If a
participant’s cancer got worse after their last treatment, he or she could keep getting the study
treatments for up to 12 months.
