What are the 4 trials that are included in this
summary?
The results discussed in this summary come from 4 different AZD1222 clinical
trials. These are:
• COV001 – a Phase 1 and 2 trial in the United Kingdom
• COV002 – a Phase 2 and 3 trial in the United Kingdom
• COV003 – a Phase 3 trial in Brazil
• COV005 – a Phase 1 and 2 trial in South Africa
All of the trials compared AZD1222 with a control. The control injection does
not have any of the genetic information about SARS-CoV-2 in it. Researchers use
controls to help make sure any effects they see in the participants who receive a
vaccine are actually caused by that particular vaccine. Controls also help to rule
out effects that may be caused by the injection itself.
COV001, COV002, and COV003 were all “single-blind” trials. This means that
the researchers, trial doctors, and other trial staff may have known whether the
participants were receiving AZD1222 or the control, but the participants did not.
In these trials, only the person giving the injection knew whether the participant
received AZD1222 or the control.
• For the control, COV001 and COV002 used an existing vaccine against
meningitis infections called “MenACWY”.
• COV003 used the MenACWY vaccine as the control for the first injection. For the
second injection, COV003 used an injection of salt water, also known as “saline”.
COV005 was a “double-blind” trial. This means that none of the participants,
researchers, trial doctors, or other trial staff knew whether the participant was
receiving AZD1222 or the control. If it was needed for safety reasons, it was
possible for the trial doctors or staff to find out what a participant was receiving.
• For the control, this trial used saline.
