Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some participants could not get to all of
their study treatment, and the researchers were not able to collect complete
information after Week 40. Because of this, the researchers used the information
from Week 40, even though the participants were meant to take the study
treatment for 56 weeks.
The researchers found that after 40 weeks of treatment, the participantsâ€™ average
NPS:
X decreased by 0.4 points in the participants who got benralizumab
X increased by 0.2 points in the participants who got the placebo
