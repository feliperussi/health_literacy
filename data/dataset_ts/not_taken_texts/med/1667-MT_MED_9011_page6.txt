Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did infants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the infants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the drug. These medical problems
are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is
life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.

study drug or placebo. Only the remaining 1,447 participants were included in the safety
assessment.
