Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug MEDI0382. All
the participants helped researchers learn more about using MEDI0382 to help people who have
type 2 diabetes.
MedImmune, an AstraZeneca company, sponsored this study and thinks it is important to
share the results of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps
the participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 5 months. But the entire study took about 7
months to finish.
The study started in May 2018 and ended in December 2018. It included 49 participants in
Germany and Hungary.
When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data collected and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
