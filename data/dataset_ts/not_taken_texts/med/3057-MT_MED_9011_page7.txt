How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how GFF worked in participants with moderate to very
severe COPD.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further studies comparing GFF and UV are not currently planned.
