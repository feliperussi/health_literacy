How much of AB/FF and the AB metabolites were in the blood?
To answer this question, the doctors tested participants’ blood throughout the study
and focused on measurements for AB, the 2 AB metabolites, and FF. They studied
the results for these measurements on the first and fifth days that the participants
took AB/FF.
In this study, the researchers focused on the following measurements for AB, the
2 AB metabolites, and FF:
• how long it took for them to reach their highest amounts in the blood
• the average amounts in the blood
• how long it took for half of the amounts to leave the blood after the last dose
On the first day the participants took AB/FF:
• It took about 0.1 hours for AB to reach its highest amount in the blood.
• It took about 1.8 hours for the first AB metabolite to reach its highest amount
in the blood.
• It took about 3.0 hours for the second AB metabolite to reach its highest
amount in the blood.
• It took about 1.0 hour for FF to reach its highest amount in the blood.
