Clinical Study Results
How much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood when they took it in
forms meant for children?
The researchers found that the amounts of ticagrelor and the metabolite in the blood
were about the same for each of the treatments they compared.
To answer this question, the researchers compared:
• taking ticagrelor as several children’s tablets to a powder mixed with a liquid
• taking ticagrelor as several children’s tablets mixed with water to a powder mixed with
a liquid
This information helps the researchers learn if the amount of ticagrelor that gets into the
blood when taken as a form meant for children is different when mixed into a liquid.
