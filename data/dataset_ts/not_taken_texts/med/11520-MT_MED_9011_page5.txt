What happened during this study?
The study started in June 2018 and ended in March 2021.
Based on some of the medical problems the participants were having, and
because some of the drugs were not effective in treating the participants’ cancer,
the researchers decided to end the study early.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
once. This part of the study lasted for up to 1 month. At this visit, the study
doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
• did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an “ECG”
• took images of the participants’ swollen lymph nodes using a CT scan
• took a “biopsy”, which is a small sample of the participants’ cancer
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
several times. The number of visits was different for each treatment group. This
part of the study lasted for up to 1 year.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 2
or more times. They visited the study site 1 month after they finished treatment,
then every 3 months. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants.
