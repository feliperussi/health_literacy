Did taking fluvoxamine and/or smoking affect how much AZD4635 got
into the participants’ blood?
Overall, the researchers found that taking fluvoxamine increased how much
AZD4635 got into the participants’ blood. They also found that smoking did not
affect how much AZD4635 got into the participants’ blood.
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples throughout the
study from the smokers and non-smokers. Samples were taken during Part 1 when
the participants took AZD4635 alone and during Part 2 when the participants took
AZD4635 and fluvoxamine. In these samples, they measured:
X the blood sample with the highest amount of AZD4635
X the total amount of AZD4635 in the participants’ blood over time
X the total amount of AZD4635 in the participants’ last blood sample
Based on the results from each participant, researchers calculated an average
for each of these measurements. The researchers then compared the results of
when the participants took only AZD4635 to when they took both AZD4635 and
fluvoxamine. They also compared the results of the participants who were smokers
to those who were non-smokers.
