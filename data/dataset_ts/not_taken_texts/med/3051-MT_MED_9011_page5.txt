What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, most participants got a combination treatment of MEDI0457 and
durvalumab.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
Participants were given MEDI0457 through an injection into a muscle, followed by
a process called “electroporation”, which improves the response of the immune
system to MEDI0457.
Participants were also given durvalumab through a needle into a vein, also called
an IV infusion.
The chart below shows the treatment plan for the study.
35 participants
• MEDI0457 through an injection into a muscle
• Durvalumab through a needle into a vein
• MEDI0457 during weeks 1, 3, 7, and 12 of the study,
and then every 8 weeks
• Durvalumab during weeks 4, 8, and 12 of the study,
and then every 4 weeks
