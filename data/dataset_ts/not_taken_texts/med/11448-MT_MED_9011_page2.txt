Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 21 to 55 years old when they joined.
The study included 54 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to treat B-cell lymphoid cancer, also known as
B-cell lymphoma. This is a cancer of the white blood cells in the immune system.
Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe it is and how it works.
B-cell lymphoid cancer is a type of blood cancer that affects B lymphocytes, a type
of white blood cell in the immune system. The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used
to treat certain types of blood cancers. It works by stopping the cancer cells from
growing out of control.
Acalabrutinib is already available as a capsule. Researchers are now studying
acalabrutinib in a tablet form.
Some people take antacids, also known as “proton-pump inhibitors” to decrease
stomach acid and prevent open sores in part of the intestine. These sores are
called “ulcers”. Earlier studies in healthy participants have shown that when there
is less stomach acid, it is harder for acalabrutinib taken as a capsule to get into
the blood. Researchers think that acalabrutinib as a tablet may be less affected by
stomach acid than acalabrutinib as a capsule.
Earlier studies in healthy participants have also shown that eating a high-fat meal
makes it harder for acalabrutinib taken as a capsule to get into the blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about acalabrutinib in healthy
participants and to compare how much acalabrutinib got into the blood when
taken as a capsule or as a tablet. The researchers also wanted to find out if the
particle size of acalabrutinib affected how much acalabrutinib got into the blood.
