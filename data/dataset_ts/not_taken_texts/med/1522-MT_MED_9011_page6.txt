What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have additional information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
