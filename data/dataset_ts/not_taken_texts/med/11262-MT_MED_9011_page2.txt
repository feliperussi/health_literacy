Clinical Study Results
Famotidine is a drug prescribed by doctors to treat certain conditions, such as high levels
of acid in the stomach. The level of acid in the stomach can sometimes affect how quickly
a drug gets into the blood and how much of a drug gets into the blood. So, in this study, the
researchers wanted to learn how quickly savolitinib got into the blood and how much of it
got into the blood when taken with and without famotidine. They also wanted to find out if
the participants had any medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did savolitinib act in the body when taken with famotidine?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know. Other studies are being done to
find out if savolitinib helps improve the health of people who have tumors.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took 2 treatments:
• savolitinib
• savolitinib and famotidine
All of the participants took both treatments, but in a different order.
The participants took both of the treatments as pills by mouth.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors,
and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the participants
took the treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
