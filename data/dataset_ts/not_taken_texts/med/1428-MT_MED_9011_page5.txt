The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were designed to boost the
immune systemâ€™s reaction. This helps the immune cells attack the tumor cells again
and can stop the tumor from growing or shrink the tumor.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how durvalumab alone or with
tremelimumab works in a large number of participants. The participants had
advanced HNSCC that had come back after treatment or had spread and could
not be removed by surgery. The researchers in this study wanted to compare
durvalumab with and without tremelimumab to standard treatments. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any adverse reactions during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live longer than
standard treatment?
X Did the participants getting durvalumab with or without tremelimumab have
less severe symptoms and improved health related quality of life?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know to find out if durvalumab
with or without tremelimumab is safe and effective at treating people with
advanced HNSCC.
