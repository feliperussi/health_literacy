Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have heart disease.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe it is and how it works.
There are several causes of heart disease, including the buildup of cholesterol
in the arteries of the heart. There are 2 different types of cholesterol. There is 1
called “low-density lipoprotein” cholesterol, also known as LDL cholesterol. This
type is considered “bad” cholesterol and can clog arteries and blood vessels.
The other type of cholesterol is called “high-density lipoprotein” cholesterol, also
known as HDL cholesterol. This type is considered “good” cholesterol and helps
remove bad cholesterol from the blood.
The study drug, MEDI5884, is being developed to increase HDL levels in the blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if MEDI5884 affected cholesterol
levels in healthy participants. They also wanted to learn about the safety of
MEDI5884.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI5884 affect HDL cholesterol levels in the blood?
• Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if MEDI5884 improves the health of people who have heart
disease.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 22 to 54 years old when they joined.
