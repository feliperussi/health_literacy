Clinical Trial Results
The figure below shows how Part B of the study was done.

Participants stayed at the study site for 2 days
During both parts of study, study doctors did physical examinations and checked the blood
pressure and heart rate of each participant. Study doctors did tests to check the heart health of
participants and took samples of their blood and urine. Study doctors also asked participants about
any medicines they were taking and how they were feeling.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked during the study. It is
important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines
work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD4831 are planned.
How did AZD4831 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to see how AZD4831 acted in the body when it was taken on an empty
stomach and with food. Researchers wanted to know:
• The average amount of AZD4831 in the blood
• The highest amount of AZD4831 in the blood
• The time it took for AZD4831 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Overall, researchers found the following results:
• During Part A, AZD4831 was quickly taken up into the blood.
• Participants who took the higher doses of AZD4831 had higher average amounts
of AZD4831 in the blood.
• During Part B, when taken with a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast, AZD4831 was taken
up into the blood more slowly than in Part A. The amount of AZD4831 in the blood
was a little lower in Part B than in Part A.
