Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had
might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers wanted
to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of the summary. If a full report of the

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor
before making any treatment changes.
How much air could the participants breathe out after taking AS MDI?
The researchers found that after taking either dose of AS MDI, the participants:
• breathed out more air compared to taking a placebo that contains no medicine
• breathed out about the same amount of air compared to taking the same dose of Proventil
To answer this question, the researchers compared how much air participants could breathe
out before and 6 hours after taking each treatment. The researchers found that the participants
who took:
• placebo could exhale 70 mL more air
• 90 µg of AS MDI could exhale 203 mL more air
• 90 µg of Proventil could exhale 240 mL more air
• 180 µg of AS MDI could exhale 266 mL more air
• 180 µg of Proventil could exhale 282 mL more air
