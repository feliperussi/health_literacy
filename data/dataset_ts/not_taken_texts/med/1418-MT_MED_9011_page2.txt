Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have recurrent or metastatic
cancer of the head and neck. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells. These extra
cells can come together to form tumors, which can start in any part of the body. “Recurrent”
means that the cancer was treated, but later returned. “Metastatic” means that the cancer has
spread to other parts of the body. There are treatments for recurrent and metastatic cancer of the
head and neck. But these treatments may not stop cancer cells from growing or spreading. They
may also cause other medical problems. This is because these treatments sometimes attack
healthy cells instead of cancer cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about using durvalumab alone and
durvalumab and tremelimumab together as treatments for participants who had recurrent or
metastatic cancer of the head and neck. The researchers wanted to compare these 2 treatments
to a cancer treatment known as a “standard of care” chemotherapy treatment, or SOC treatment.
A treatment is considered an SOC treatment if the medical community thinks it is an appropriate
and widely used treatment for a disease. The researchers also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems with these treatments during the study.
Durvalumab is also called MEDI4736, and tremelimumab is also called MEDI1123. Researchers
think that these drugs may be able to help the body’s immune system attack cancer cells.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants who received the study drugs live longer compared to the participants who
received SOC treatment?
• Did the study drugs affect how the participants felt about their health?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women who
had recurrent or metastatic cancer of the head and neck. The participants in this study were 22
to 84 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was as an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew which
treatment the participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment that each participant got. This
helps make sure that the treatment groups are chosen fairly and that the groups are comparable
at the time treatment is started. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
treatment is as fair as possible.
