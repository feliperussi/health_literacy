Clinical Study Results
Did taking AZD1775 with food affect the amount of AZD1775 in the blood?
No. Overall, the researchers found that the average amounts of AZD1775 in the blood were
about the same when participants took AZD1775 with food compared to when participants took
AZD1775 without food.
To learn this, the study doctors took blood samples before and several times after the participants
took AZD1775 with and without food. The amount of AZD1775 in the blood was measured in
nanomolar, also called nM, which is the same as a nanomole per liter of blood. A “nanomole” is
1 billion times smaller than a mole, which is the usual way to measure the amount of a drug.
To find out how much AZD1775 got into the participants’ blood, the researchers measured:
• The average amount of AZD1775 in the blood after taking AZD1775 until any time later.
This was measured in nM times hours, also called nM•h. This means that AZD1775 was
measured over a period of time.
• The average amount of AZD1775 in the blood after taking AZD1775 until 72 hours later.
This was also measured in nM•h.
• The highest amount of AZD1775 in the blood after taking AZD1775. This was measured in nM.
The researchers found that the average amount of AZD1775 in the blood after taking AZD1775
until any time later was:
• 14,610 nM•h when the participants took AZD1775 with food
• 15,620 nM•h when the participants took AZD1775 without food
