Clinical Trial Results
Did the immune system of participants make antibodies against MEDI9929
in the blood?
Researchers also wanted to see if the immune system of participants made antibodies
against MEDI9929 in the blood. If antibodies form against MEDI9929, the drug may
not work as well or it may cause an allergic reaction to the drug. One or both of these
reactions could happen, or neither of these reactions could happen.
Researchers found that no participants in this study formed antibodies against
MEDI9929 after treatment.
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem.
Researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study.
These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
The results below were analyzed for 56 of the participants in the MEDI9929 group and
55 of the participants in the placebo group.
How many participants had medical problems in the study?
In this study, a similar number of participants in both the MEDI9929 and the placebo
groups had medical problems. The table below shows how many participants had
medical problems during the study.
MEDI9929 Placebo
(Out of 56 participants) (Out of 55 participants)
How many participants had
38 (67.9%) 40 (72.7%)
medical problems?
How many participants had serious
2 (3.6%) 3 (5.5%)
medical problems?
How many participants stopped treatment
2 (3.6%) 4 (7.3%)
because of medical problems?
How many participants had serious medical problems in the study?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting
problems, or needs hospitalization.
No participants died during this study.
