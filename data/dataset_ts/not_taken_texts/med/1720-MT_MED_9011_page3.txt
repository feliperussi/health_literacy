What happened during the study?
Before giving the participants any MEDI4276, the study doctors did a physical exam and
checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took pictures of the heart using an echocardiogram or a multigated acquisition, also called
MUGA, scan
If needed, the study doctors also took pictures of the liver using magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography, also called MRCP.
Some participants may have had a tumor biopsy. In this procedure, the doctor uses a needle to
take some of the tumor tissue to examine.
During the study, the participants got MEDI4276 infusions every 3 weeks. They visited their
study site up to 5 times per treatment cycle. At some of these visits, the study doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood samples
• took urine samples
• measured the participants’ vital signs
• checked the participants’ heart health using an ECG
