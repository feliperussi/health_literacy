Clinical Study Results
During both parts of the study, treatments were given during 4-week periods called “cycles”.
The participants could take part in as many cycles as they wanted unless their cancer got worse.
If their cancer got worse, the participants stopped the treatment cycles. If the study treatment
was helping the participants’ cancer at the end of the study, the participants could choose to
continue treatment.
Throughout both Part 1 and Part 2, the study doctors continued checking the participants’ tumors
and overall health and asking the participants how they were feeling.
Part 1
The participants visited their study site 2 times during the first week of Part 1. Then, they visited
their study site up to 5 times during each cycle. Each cycle lasted 4 weeks.
In Part 1, there were 28 participants. There were 4 treatment groups. The chart below shows the
treatments for each group.
