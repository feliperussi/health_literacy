during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of
many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients.
Further clinical studies with MEDI7510 are not planned.
How effective was the vaccine in preventing diseases caused by RSV?
The researchers wanted to learn if the participants developed illnesses related to
RSV. At least 14 days after the participants got their treatment, the researchers
found that:
• 16 out of 931 participants (1.7%) who got MEDI7510 and the flu vaccine
developed an illness that was thought to be related to RSV.
• 15 out of 935 participants (1.6%) who got the placebo and the flu vaccine
developed an illness that was thought to be related to RSV.
The total number of participants above is less than the total number of participants
who started this study. This is because some participants did not finish this study.
