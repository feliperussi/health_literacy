Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.
Could the researchers develop a useful model to predict the amount of
olaparib in the participants’ blood?
The researchers developed a mathematical model to help understand the need
for future studies with olaparib. To test how useful this model was, they took 2
measurements from the participants’ blood samples during each treatment period.
These measurements were:
• The average highest level of olaparib in the blood after the participants
took 1 dose
• The average total level of olaparib in the blood over time after the participants
took 1 dose
These results helped the researchers understand how to predict olaparib levels in
the participants’ blood. The researchers were also able to compare these results to
how well the different doses of the drug dissolved. They found that their model was
useful for helping them predict the levels of olaparib in the participants’ blood.
