The participants in this study were taking a medication called metformin when
they joined the study. Metformin can affect the glycogen levels in the liver, which
the researchers were measuring. So, the participants stopped taking metformin
for 5 days before starting the study treatment. This is called a “wash-out”
period. After this time period, they started taking metformin again. They also
stopped taking metformin for the last 5 days of the study treatment.
