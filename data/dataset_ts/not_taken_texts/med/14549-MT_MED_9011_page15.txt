Based on these results, the researchers calculated that overall, AZD1222 was
66.7% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections confirmed by a
positive test. This is the overall efficacy of AZD1222.
This means that the AZD1222 vaccine reduced the risk of getting COVID-19 in the clinical
trials by 66.7% compared with the controls.
