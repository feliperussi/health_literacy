Clinical Trial RESULTS
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers
asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the
results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest
for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD9496 are currently planned.
How did AZD9496 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to know how the study drug acted in the body.
So they measured the average amount of AZD9496 in the blood for
all of the treatments. Researchers compared the 3 different types of
capsules to the tablet.
When researchers compared the 100-mg capsules to the tablet, they
found that:
• The average amount of AZD9496 in participants’ blood
was higher for the tablet than for any of the capsules.
• The average amount of AZD9496 in the blood for Capsule A
was 31.8% of the average amount for the tablet.
• The average amount of AZD9496 in the blood for Capsule B
was 54.2% of the average amount for the tablet.
• The average amount of AZD9496 in the blood for Capsule C
was 41.2% of the average amount for the tablet.
When researchers compared the 2 Capsule B doses, they found that:
• The average amount of AZD9496 in the blood for the 300-mg
dose was 114.2% of the average amount for the 100-mg dose.
