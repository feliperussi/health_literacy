Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have high levels of uric acid
in their blood. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
Uric acid is a waste product of the body and is found in urine and blood. High levels of
uric acid in the blood can cause gout, which is a build up of uric acid that makes joints
swollen and painful. High levels of uric acid in the blood have also been linked to medical
problems with the heart and kidneys, and to high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.
Lowering the level of uric acid in the blood may stop or slow down the development of
these problems.
RDEA3170, febuxostat, and dapagliflozin are study drugs that lower the levels of uric acid
in the blood. RDEA3170 works by increasing the amount of uric acid that leaves the body in
the urine. Febuxostat works by decreasing the amount of uric acid that the body makes. It is
not known exactly how dapagliflozin lowers the amount of uric acid in the blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if treatment with RDEA3170, febuxostat,
and dapagliflozin works in a small number of participants who have high levels of uric
acid in their blood. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the study treatments change the amount of uric acid in blood and urine?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women
who had high levels of uric acid in their blood but had never had gout. The participants in
this study were 20 to 63 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results
of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment
participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
