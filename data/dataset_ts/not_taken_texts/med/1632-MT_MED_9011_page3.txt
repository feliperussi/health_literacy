Clinical Study Results
How did fexofenadine act in the body when taken with osimertinib?
Researchers wanted to find out how fexofenadine acted in the body when taken with
osimertinib compared to when the drugs were taken separately. So, study doctors took blood
samples from the participants at different times during the study. Then, the researchers
measured the average amount and the highest amount of both drugs in the blood.
In general, researchers found that the average and highest amounts of fexofenadine were
greater when participants took osimertinib and fexofenadine together compared to when they
took fexofenadine alone.
What medical problems did participants have?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think might be
related to the study drugs are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drugs.
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary because there
was a very small number of participants. Leaving this information out helps protect their
identities. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers compare how fexofenadine acted in the body when taken
with osimertinib.
The results presented here are for a single study. Researchers look at the results of many
studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the
main results from this 1 study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with osimertinib are planned or ongoing.
