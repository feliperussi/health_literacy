Did rabeprazole affect how much of acalabrutinib given as a tablet and
its metabolite got into the blood?
No. The researchers found that overall, rabeprazole did not affect how much of
acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood.
To answer this question, the study doctors measured:
X the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during the study
X the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during the study
Then, the researchers compared:
X the results when the participants got acalabrutinib as a tablet mixed in water
and did not take rabeprazole during Treatment 1
X the results when the participants got acalabrutinib as a tablet mixed in water
and did take rabeprazole during Treatment 3
Overall, the researchers found that both the average total and average highest
amounts of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were similar when the
participants got Treatment 1 and Treatment 3. This told them that rabeprazole did
not affect how much of acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood.
