How did ZS affect the potassium levels in the body?
The researchers found that ZS helped decrease the potassium levels in urine
and in the blood.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the potassium levels in the
urine and blood of participants several times each day during the study. They
compared the participants’ urine and blood potassium levels before and after
treatment.
The potassium levels were measured in millimoles a day, also known as
mmol/24 h.
At the end of the treatment period, the researchers found that:
• The participants who took 5 g of ZS had an average decrease of
13.0 mmol/24 h in their urine potassium levels compared to before
treatment.
• The participants who took 10 g of ZS had an average decrease of
15.4 mmol/24 h in their urine potassium levels compared to before
treatment.
