Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI6012.
You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about MEDI6012 to help
people with cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis.
MedImmune, LLC sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
You were in the study for up to 18 weeks. But the entire study took almost 11 months
to finish.
The study started in January 2017 and ended in November 2017. The study included
32 participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have cardiovascular
disease caused by atherosclerosis. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
