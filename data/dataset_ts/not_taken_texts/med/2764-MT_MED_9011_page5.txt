Clinical Trial RESULTS
How much RDEA3170 was in participants’ blood after each dose?
In Part 1 and 2 of the study, researchers measured the highest amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood in
nanograms per milliliter. The highest amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood depended on which dose
they took.
Researchers also measured the amount of time it took for RDEA3170 to reach the highest amount in
participants’ blood. The median time is the amount of time halfway between the shortest time and the longest
time it took for RDEA3170 to reach the highest amount in the blood. The median time for RDEA3170
to reach the highest amount in participants’ blood was 4 hours after single doses of 4.5, 6, and 12 mg
RDEA3170.
In Part 1 of the study, researchers took blood samples on Days 1, 5, and 9 about 30 minutes before
participants took RDEA3170. Then, more blood samples were taken every few hours each day until they were
discharged from the clinical research unit.
The figure below shows the median time RDEA3170 took to reach the highest amount in the blood and the
highest amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood after single doses of 4.5, 6, and 12 mg RDEA3170.

In Part 2 of the study, researchers took blood samples on Days 1 and 7 about 30 minutes before participants
took RDEA3170. Then, more blood samples were taken every few hours for 1 day after the participants took
RDEA3170.
