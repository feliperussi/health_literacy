Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug MEDI0382.
MedImmune sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the study
doctor or staff at your study site.
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who have obesity. The participants in
this study were 19 to 64 years old when they joined and did not have diabetes or other serious
health problems.
The study included 51 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to help people who have obesity. Before a drug can
be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and
how it works.
Some people with obesity may have a hard time losing weight through lifestyle changes alone
and may need extra help from medical treatments. Obesity can lead to serious problems such as
heart disease or type 2 diabetes.
Researchers think MEDI0382 can reduce appetite and slow digestion, which helps people feel
full for longer. This may help people to lose weight.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI0382 in participants
with obesity.
