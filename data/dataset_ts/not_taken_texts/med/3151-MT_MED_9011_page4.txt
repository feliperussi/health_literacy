themselves when they are damaged. Olaparib is also available in some countries
for other types of cancers.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab with olaparib works
better than durvalumab with the placebo in a small number of participants with
advanced bladder cancer. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab and olaparib together help the participants live longer with
their cancer before it got worse?
X Did the participants feel that getting durvalumab and olaparib together
helped with their symptoms and quality of life?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if durvalumab with olaparib helps improve the health of people
with advanced bladder cancer.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either durvalumab and olaparib, or durvalumab
and a placebo that looked like olaparib. A placebo looks like a drug but does not
have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the
effects they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused by the
drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatments each participant was
getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatments the participants got so they
could create a report of the study results.
