What happened during this study?
The study started in July 2016 and study treatment was stopped in February 2017.
The researchers stopped the study early because some study participants had an
increase in a liver protein called ALT. The researchers stopped the study to prevent
any future increases in ALT in the study participants.
Study participants were monitored up until October 2019. This was done to make
sure the study treatment was no longer in the participants’ blood.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time on 1 day. This part of the study lasted for 6 weeks. At this visit, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants to make sure they could join the
study. The study doctors:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood and urine samples
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
called an ECG
X took pictures of each participant’s liver using magnetic resonance imaging,
also called MRI. This was done to measure the amount of fat in the liver
X checked how much sugar was in the participants’ blood and measured how
well insulin was working in the body using a method called “clamp”
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
