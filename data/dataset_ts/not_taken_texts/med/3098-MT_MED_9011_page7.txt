How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how SZC affects blood potassium levels
in patients who had kidney failure who were receiving hemodialysis.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with SZC are planned.
