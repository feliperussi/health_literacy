Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the
results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
treatment the participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
The participants in the study got either MEDI5884 or a placebo as an injection
through a needle under the skin. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have
any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects
they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused by the drug. The
MEDI5884 doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. At
this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the
study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• studied the participants’ vital signs
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
