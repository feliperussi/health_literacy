Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
The study drug, AZD4635, is being developed to treat some cancers. In this
study, the researchers compared a capsule form of AZD4635 with a liquid form of
AZD4635, both taken by mouth. They wanted to learn how the different forms of
AZD4635 acted in the blood of healthy participants.
The participants also took a drug called lansoprazole. Lansoprazole is a medicine
that is normally used to help with acid reflux or heartburn. It changes the acidity of
the stomach and may affect how much AZD4635 gets into the blood.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Was the amount of AZD4635 in the participants’ blood similar when given in
each form?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if AZD4635 improves the health of people with cancer.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. Everyone in the study was
aged 19 to 53 when they joined and did not smoke or use other nicotine products.
