After 16 weeks, did the participants feel that dapagliflozin helped their
overall heart failure symptoms?
Yes. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin felt that it helped their overall
heart failure symptoms after 16 weeks.
The numbers of participants whose results were included in this part of the study
were:
> 153 participants who took dapagliflozin
> 147 participants who took placebo
Overall, the researchers found that the median changes in total symptom scores
16 weeks after starting the study treatment were:
