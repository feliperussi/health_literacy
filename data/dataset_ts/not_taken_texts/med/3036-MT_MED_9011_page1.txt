Study title: A study in healthy male participants to learn if
AZD4831 is safe to take
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD4831.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results of the study. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in November 2017.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 38 participants in the United States. But, 1 participant decided
to leave the study early before taking any study drug.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart disease. Before a drug
can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is.
The researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during this study. This information is important to know before other studies can
be done that will help find out if AZD4831 improves the health of people with
heart disease.
Heart disease can happen when the body produces too much of a specific type
of protein. The study drug, AZD4831, may be able to help reduce the levels of
this protein in the body. Having a lower level of this protein may help improve the
health of patients with heart disease.
