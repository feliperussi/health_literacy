Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat high levels of LDL cholesterol.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants either got 1 of 3 doses AZD8233, or a placebo. The
participants got AZD8233 or the placebo through a needle under the skin, also known
as a “subcutaneous injection”. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How much did the different doses of AZD8233 reduce LDL cholesterol in
the blood compared with the placebo?
Overall, the researchers found that all 3 doses of AZD8233 reduced the levels
of LDL cholesterol in the blood compared with the placebo.
X What medical problems happened during this study?
There were 15.1% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most
common medical problem was pain around the area of the body where the
injection was given.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
