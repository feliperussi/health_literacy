Clinical Study Results
Did the participants feel their health was better after taking ZS?
No. Overall, the participants felt that their health was the same after taking ZS.
To answer this question, the doctors used a survey called the 36-item Short Form Survey,
also called SF-36. The participants answered this survey before and after taking ZS. The
doctors asked the participants if they felt their health was the same as, better, or worse
than 1 year earlier.

• 18.0% of participants said that their health was better than 1 year ago. This was
27 out of 150 participants.
• 60.7% of participants said that their health was the same as 1 year ago. This was
91 out of 150 participants.
• 21.3% of participants said that their health was worse than 1 year ago. This was
32 out of 150 participants.
