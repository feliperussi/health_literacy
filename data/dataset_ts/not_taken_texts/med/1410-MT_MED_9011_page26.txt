What treatments did the participants get
during the China cohort?
Participants could enter the China cohort if they had not done well with sorafenib,
another treatment commonly used in advanced HCC. There were 14 participants
in the China cohort. All of these participants took part in the study in China.
One participant did not get any study treatment. The other 13 participants got
durvalumab on its own, tremelimumab on its own, or both durvalumab and
tremelimumab.
The participants continued getting study treatment until they left the study or until
the study doctors thought it was no longer helping them.
The China cohort was “open-label”. This means the participants, researchers,
study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting. A
computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
Durvalumab and tremelimumab were each given as an injection into a vein, also
called an IV infusion. The doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of body
weight, also known as “mg/kg”.
