Clinical Study Results
To see if you could join the study, study doctors did a physical examination by checking
your height, weight, and temperature. Study doctors also took blood and urine samples and
checked your heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG. They asked
about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
In this study:
• 313 participants took dapagliflozin
• 312 participants took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin
• 312 participants took glimepiride
You and the other participants were randomly assigned to take 1 of the treatments above
and a placebo every day during the study. You took 4 pills each day. The figure below
shows how the study was done.

What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during
this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to
decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with
dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are ongoing.
Did blood sugar levels change for participants who got the different drugs?
Researchers wanted to learn if participants’ blood sugar levels changed after being in
the study. Some participants left the study before it was finished, so researchers couldn’t
measure the change in blood sugar levels for everyone.
