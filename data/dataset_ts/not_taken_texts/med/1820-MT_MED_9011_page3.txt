Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants got MEDI0562 and durvalumab or MEDI0562 and
tremelimumab through a needle into a vein, also known as an IV infusion.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
At the beginning of the study, several groups of participants started out taking a
low dose of the study treatments. The study doctors looked at the results for these
participants. Then, the researchers decided whether to increase the dose of study
treatments in the next groups of participants.
The participants kept getting their study treatment until any of the these happened:
• they had a serious medical problem that the study doctors thought might be related to
the study treatment
• their tumors grew
• they decided to stop taking study treatment for any other reason
The sponsor planned to include 19 treatment groups in the study, but they ended
the study early. So, there were 8 treatment groups.
The doses were measured in milligrams, also known as mg. The doses of each
study drug depended on what group the participants were in.
