Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in March 2016 and ended in August 2019. The researchers
planned to have 2 parts to this study. In Part 2 of the study, a larger number of
participants with different tumor types were planned to be included. But, the
sponsor ended the study early. This was because they decided not to keep
researching MEDI0562 in people with advanced solid tumors. This decision was
not because of any safety worries about the study treatments.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants to make
sure they could join the study. This part of the study lasted up to 4 weeks. The
study doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical
problems they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took pictures of each participant’s tumors and their brain using CT or MRI scans
• used surgery to take a sample of the tumor called a biopsy for some participants
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site at
least 11 times during the first 12 weeks. After that, participants visited their study
site every 2 weeks for as long as they got study treatment. At each visit the doctors
checked the health of the participants.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time,
up to 4 weeks after their last dose. After that, the participants visited their study site
every 3 months until the study ended. The study doctors checked the health of the
participants at these visits.
