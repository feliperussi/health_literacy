Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants in this study got MEDI4736 and tremelimumab through a needle into a vein,
also known as an IV infusion.
The study happened in 2 parts. Both parts were “open-label”. This means the participants,
researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
Part A was done so the researchers could find the dose to give to the participants in Part B. In
Part A, there were 102 participants. There were 10 groups of participants, and the groups got
different doses of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab. Each participant stayed on the same assigned
dose throughout this part of the study.
• The participants in Groups 1 through 8 got 1 dose of MEDI4736 every 4 weeks.
• The participants in Groups 9 and 10 got 1 dose of MEDI4736 every 2 weeks.
• All of the participants got 1 dose of tremelimumab every 4 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12
weeks for 36 weeks.
In Part B there were 355 participants. The participants in Part B were not the same participants
that were in Part A. In this part, the participants were put into 1 of 3 groups based on the types of
NSCLC treatments they had tried before the study.
All of the participants got MEDI4736 and tremelimumab every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. Then, they
got only MEDI4736 every 4 weeks for 36 weeks.
The chart below shows the groups in Part B.
