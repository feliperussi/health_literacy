Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what treatment the participant was getting.
In this study, the participants got 2 forms of AZD7594. All of the participants got
these forms in the same order. The first form was given through an inhaler. The
second form was combined with a tracer and given through an IV.
The AZD7594 doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg.
What happened during the study?
Before getting treatment, the participants visited their study site 1 time over the
course of about 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the
participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site 1 time and stayed there
for about 1 week. During this time, they got both of the below treatments 1 time:
• 720 μg of AZD7594 through an inhaler
• 30 μg of AZD7594 with a tracer through an IV
Throughout the study and before the participants left their study site, the
researchers continued checking the participants’ overall health and asking them
how they were feeling. They also took blood, urine, and feces samples.
