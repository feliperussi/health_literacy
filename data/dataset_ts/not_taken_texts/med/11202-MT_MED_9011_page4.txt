Clinical Study Results
While the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 2 times over the
course of about 3 weeks.
During Part 1, the participants visited their study site and stayed overnight. They stayed
for 4 days and took 1 dose of savolitinib.
Then, there was a “washout period” of about 2 weeks before the next visit. During this
time, the participants did not take any study treatment and did not take certain medicines.
This means that their bodies had time to process all of the savolitinib, and any medicines
in their blood had “washed out” of their bodies.
After the washout period, the participants visited their study site again and stayed for
about 1 week. Part 2 happened during the first half of the week, and Part 3 happened
during the second half of the week.
During Part 2, the participants took rifampicin once a day for 5 days.
During Part 3, the participants took savolitinib and rifampicin on the first day. Then, they
took only rifampicin on the second day of treatment.
About 2 weeks after their last treatment, the participants visited their study site
1 more time. At this visit, the study doctors again checked the participants’ health and
asked them how they were feeling.
