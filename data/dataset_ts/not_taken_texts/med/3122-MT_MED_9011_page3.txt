Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that participants took each
treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before study treatment, the doctors checked your overall health to see if you could join the
study. They asked about your medical history, how you were feeling and what medications you
were taking. They took blood and urine samples from you. If the doctors found that you were
able to join the study, they asked you to stop any treatments you were taking for asthma. This
helped the doctors make sure any effects they saw during treatment were due to the treatment
in this study.
During the study, you and the other participants visited your study site up to 5 times. At each
visit, you took AS MDI, Proventil, or the placebo.
At each visit, the doctors or study staff measured the amount of air that you could breathe
out before and after you took each treatment. The researchers wanted to see how the
treatment affected your breathing.
After the study ended, the doctors called you to see how you were feeling.
The figure below shows how the study was done.
