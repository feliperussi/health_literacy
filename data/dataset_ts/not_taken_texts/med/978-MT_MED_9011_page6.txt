What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
