What medical problems did participants have that
occurred during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had, which occurred
during the study and that the study doctors thought might be related to the study
drug. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
In the results below, Group 1 participants were given 150 mg anifrolumab and Group 2
participants were given 300 mg anifrolumab. Results from Group 3 and 4 are combined.
This is because the participants in both of these groups got the placebo.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
