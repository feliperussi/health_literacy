What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions that researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed
at the end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it
can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements
throughout the study. The study doctors did physical exams and tested the
participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall health. The study
doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
