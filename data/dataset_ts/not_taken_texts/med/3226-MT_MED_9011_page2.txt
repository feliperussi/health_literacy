Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a drug can
be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got tezepelumab or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it.
The participants in this study had been taking asthma treatments called inhaled
corticosteroids before they joined the study. Inhaled corticosteroids are also known
as “ICS”.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did tezepelumab reduce the numbers of inflammatory cells in the
participants’ airways?
Overall, the researchers found that the number of 1 type of inflammatory cell
called an eosinophil was much lower in the participants who got tezepelumab
than in those who got the placebo. For all the other cell types, the researchers
found that the changes in cell numbers were similar in both treatment groups.
The results were too similar for the researchers to know if tezepelumab affected
the numbers of these inflammation cells.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 11.2% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during this study. This was
13 out of 116 participants. The most common medical problem was pain at the
injection site.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
