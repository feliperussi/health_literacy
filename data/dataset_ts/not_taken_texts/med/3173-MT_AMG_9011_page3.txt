 Because women with postmenopausal osteoporosis often receive a medicine called
zoledronic acid (after stopping oral bisphopshonates), researchers were interested in
how denosumab compared to zoledronic acid.
 In this study, researchers compared denosumab with zoledronic acid in women with
postmenopausal osteoporosis who had been taking an oral bisphosphonate. The
effectiveness and safety of these two medicines were compared over 12 months.
 The first patient entered the study on November 7th, 2012 and the last patient finished
the study on January 9th, 2015. Each participant was to stay in the study for up to 12
months.
4. What patients/people were included in this study?
 643 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis took part in this study, including:
- 461 women (72%, or about 72 out of 100) from the European Union
- 156 women (24%, or about 24 out of 100) from North America
- 26 women (4%, or about 4 out of 100) from Australia
