the results below are for 128 out of 129 participants.
Did AZD5718 affect the levels of leukotriene E4 in the participants’
urine?
Yes. Overall, AZD5718 reduced the levels of leukotriene E4 in the participants’
urine.
To answer this question, the researchers took urine samples from the participants
during the study. The researchers measured leukotriene E4 levels before and
after the participants took the study treatment. They measured any change in
leukotriene E4 levels as a percentage. Then, they compared the differences in
the average change between the participants who took the 2 different doses of
AZD5718 and the participants who took the placebo.
For the participants who took study treatment for 4 weeks, the
researchers found that the average change in leukotriene E4 levels in the
participants’ urine was:
> 96.0% different between the participants who took the high dose of AZD5718
and the participants who took the placebo
> 92.0% different between the participants who took the low dose of AZD5718
and the participants who took the placebo
