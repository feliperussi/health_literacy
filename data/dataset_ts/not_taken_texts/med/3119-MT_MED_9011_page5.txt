Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results that each
of the participants had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of
the questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites
listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it
can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did the participants have changes in the results of their health tests and
measurements during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and
measurements that were done before the participants got treatment to the results
throughout the study.
The researchers focused on the below tests and measurements:
• physical examinations
• blood and urine samples
• heart health, by using ECGs
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants’
results during the study. But these changes were too small for the researchers to
consider them to be meaningful.
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had during the
study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study drug. An adverse
event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
the participant needs hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the adverse events that happened during this study.
