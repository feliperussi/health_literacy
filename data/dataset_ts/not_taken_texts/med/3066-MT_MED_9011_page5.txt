What happened during the study?
The researchers planned for the study to have 2 parts. But, they ended the study
before part 2 began. This was because they found that the participants were not
getting enough benefit from this treatment, compared to the medical problems
that they were having during the study.
The study started in March 2017 and ended in January 2020.
