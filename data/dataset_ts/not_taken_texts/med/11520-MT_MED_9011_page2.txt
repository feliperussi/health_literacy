Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. The participants in this study were 34 to 88 years old when they
joined. The participants:
X had cancer that hadn’t improved with earlier treatment or their cancer had
come back again after treatment
X had tried more than 1 treatment for their cancer and no other treatment
options were suitable for them
X could carry out some of their daily tasks
X had at least 1 swollen lymph node at least 15 millimeters in size
The study included 30 participants in the United States and the United Kingdom.
The study was split into 4 smaller treatment groups. Each group got a different
combination of study drugs.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that starts in a part of the
immune system called the “lymphatic system”. The lymphatic system is a part
of the body’s immune system that helps transport white blood cells, also called
“lymphocytes”. White blood cells are part of the immune system and help fight
infections. In non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lymphocytes grow abnormally and build
up in the lymphatic system and around the body.
