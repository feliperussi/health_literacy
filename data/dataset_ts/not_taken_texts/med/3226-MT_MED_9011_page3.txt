Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with moderate to severe
asthma. The participants in this study were 18 to 74 years old when they joined.
Before the start of the study, the participants had taken a type of asthma treatment
called inhaled corticosteroids for at least 12 months. Inhaled corticosteroids are
also called “ICS”. The participants had been on a steady dose of ICS for at least 3
months.
The study included 116 participants in Canada, Denmark, Germany, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if tezepelumab works in a small
number of participants with severe asthma. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a disease that causes the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs
to become inflamed and narrow. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who
have asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
There are treatments that can help people with asthma to manage their
symptoms. An example is ICS. Some people with severe asthma need many
different treatments to help control their asthma.
The study drug, tezepelumab, was designed to help reduce inflammation in the
airways in people with asthma. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out
if tezepelumab could reduce the number of cells in the participants’ airways that
cause inflammation.
