Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who have RA. The participants
were 29 to 79 years old when they joined.
The study included 21 participants in the Netherlands and Sweden.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat RA. Before a drug can be approved for
people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD9567 works in a small number
of participants who have RA. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
RA is a condition in which a person’s immune system does not work correctly. In RA, the
immune system attacks the body’s tissues, joints, and organs. This leads to pain and
swelling in the body.
There are treatments that can help people who have RA to manage their symptoms. But,
these treatments may not help some people manage their RA symptoms and may cause
medical problems.
The study drug, AZD9567, is being developed to reduce inflammation in people who have
diseases such as RA. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if AZD9567 helped
the participants manage their RA symptoms. They also wanted to compare AZD9567 to a
drug called prednisolone, which is a steroid treatment that has already been approved to
treat RA.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did AZD9567 help the participants manage their RA symptoms?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if AZD9567 helps improve the health of people who have RA.
