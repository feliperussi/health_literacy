Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study had 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Each participant was in only 1 of the 2 parts.
Before treatment, the study doctors did tests and exams to check the participants’
health to make sure they could join the study. They also checked the participants’
tumors. If the researchers then decided the participants could join the study, the
participants were put into either Part A or Part B.
In Part A, the researchers wanted to find the highest dose of AZD1775 that could help
treat participants’ tumors without causing “dose-limiting toxicities”, also called DLTs. A
DLT is a medical problem that is severe enough to stop the researcher from increasing
a participant’s study drug dose.
There were 12 participants in Part A. All of the participants were scheduled to take 200
mg of AZD1775 twice a day for 3 days. These doses were scheduled to be taken at the
beginning of weeks 1 and 2 of each cycle.
Three of the first 7 participants who took the 200 mg AZD1775 doses had DLTs before
the other 5 participants were able to start their doses. So, the researchers lowered the
treatment doses to 175 mg of AZD1775 for the other 5 participants after studying the
results from the first 7 participants.
After the researchers studied all of the results from Part A, they began giving treatment
to participants in Part B.
In Part B, 80 participants took 175 mg of AZD1775 twice a day for 3 days. They did
this at the beginning of weeks 1 and 2 of each cycle.
After treatment, all of the participants visited their study site up to 12 times. At these
visits, the doctors checked the participants’ tumor growth and overall health. They also
asked the participants how they were feeling.
