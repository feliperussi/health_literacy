The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities the participants had during
the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is an adverse event that is severe enough to stop the study

known as a DLT.
3.0% of the participants had a DLT during the study. This happened in 1 out of 33 participants.
