Clinical Study Results
During the study, the participants got MEDI6012 or a placebo in different ways.
Some of the participants got each treatment through a needle in their vein in a process that
took about an hour to complete. This is called a 1-hour infusion. They got this treatment once
a week for the first 3 weeks of the study. These participants got 1 of 3 doses of MEDI6012 or
a placebo. The doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg:
• 40 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo
• 120 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo
• 300 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo
Other participants got their treatment through a needle in their vein more quickly in a
process that only took about 1 to 3 minutes. This is called an “IV push”. The researchers
looked at the IV push to learn more about this treatment approach for future studies. These
participants got different doses at different visits:
• 300 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo at the first visit
• 150 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo at the second visit 2 days after the first visit
• 100 mg of MEDI6012 or a placebo at the third visit 1 week after the second visit
The doctors asked the participants not to eat anything the night before their study visits.
Throughout the study, the researchers continued checking the heart health of the participants
and taking blood and urine samples.
After their last dose, the participants visited the study site 5 more times.
