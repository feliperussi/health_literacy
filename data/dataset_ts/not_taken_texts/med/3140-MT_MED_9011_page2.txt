Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants’ test results and measurements of safety change throughout
the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to help find out if AZD5718 improves the health of people with heart disease.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy Japanese men living in the United States.
Everyone in the study was 21 to 49 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the participants
were taking but the participants did not.
During this study, the participants took either AZD5718 or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help
make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually
caused by the drug.
The participants took AZD5718 or the placebo by mouth as liquid. The doses were
measured in milligrams, also called mg. There were 4 different groups of participants.
Each group was given 1 of the following doses: 60 mg, 180 mg, 360 mg, or 600 mg.
For each group, a computer program was used to randomly choose if the participants
took one of the doses of AZD5718 or the placebo. This helps make sure the treatments
are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment
is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants started treatment, the doctors checked their overall
health to make sure they could join the study. The doctors:
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
• checked the heart health of participants by doing a test called an electrocardiogram,
also called an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• did a physical examination
