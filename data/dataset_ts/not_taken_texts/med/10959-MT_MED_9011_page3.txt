Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means some of the study staff knew what the
participants were getting, but the participants did not.
In this study, the participants got benralizumab through a needle under the skin,
also known as an injection. The benralizumab doses were measured in milligrams,
also called mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the benralizumab dose each
participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
