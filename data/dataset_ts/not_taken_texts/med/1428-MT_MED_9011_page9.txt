What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions that researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed
at the end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it
can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did durvalumab alone help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live
longer than standard treatment?
The researchers wanted to know how durvalumab alone affected participants with
a certain type of HNSCC called PD-L1 high cancer. People with this type of cancer
have a large amount of the PD-L1 protein on their tumor cells. Durvalumab works
by attaching to PD-L1 proteins on tumor cells. This lets the immune cells attack
the tumor cells again and helps stop the tumor from growing.
For this question, the researchers looked only at the participants who had PD-L1
high cancer. Of these participants, there were 99 who got durvalumab and 94 who
got the standard treatment.
There were 190 participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab, but their
results are not included in this section. This is because the main goal of the study
changed after it had started. The new main goal was to focus on how effective
durvalumab alone was in this group of participants, rather than how effective
durvalumab and tremelimumab were together. There are some links on the last
page of this summary where you can find more information about the results of
these participants.
Overall, the researchers found that in the participants who had PD-L1 high cancer,
the participants who got durvalumab alone and those who got the standard
treatment lived for about the same amount of time after starting treatment.
