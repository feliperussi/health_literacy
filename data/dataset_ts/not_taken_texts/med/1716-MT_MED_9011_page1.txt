What is happening with the study now?
This study had 3 parts, called Part A, Part B, and Part C. This summary discusses
the results for Part B only. This is because the main questions and results the
researchers wanted to study were in Part B.
The participants in Part B were in the study for up to 17 weeks. But, the entire
study took a little more than 1 year to finish.
The overall study started in December 2015 and ended in February 2017. Part B
of the study included 51 participants in Germany.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when Part B of the study ended and
created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
