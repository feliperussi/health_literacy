Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men with mCRPC. The participants in this
study were 47 to 91 years old when they joined.
The participants all had specific changes in the genetic code of their tumors. This
means the genetic code of the tumor had changed from its original structure. The
participants had tried a type of cancer treatment called a “new hormonal agent”,
but their cancer had still gotten worse.
The study included 387 participants in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United
States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat mCRPC. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if olaparib works in a large number
of participants with mCRPC. They also wanted to find out if the participants had
any medical problems during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors in the body’s organs, such as the prostate. “Metastatic”
means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
There are only a few available treatments for mCRPC, and these may not work
for all patients. The study drug, olaparib, was designed to make it harder for
tumor cells to grow and survive. In this study, the researchers wanted to compare
olaparib to the mCRPC treatments enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate.
