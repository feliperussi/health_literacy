Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab together with
tremelimumab works in a large number of participants with advanced or
metastatic NSCLC. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
These extra cells can form tumors in any part of the body. NSCLC is a type of
lung cancer.
“Advanced” usually means that the cancer continues to grow even with
treatment. When cancer cells spread to another part of the body, this is called
“metastatic” cancer.
Normally, the immune system fights infections or anything it does not recognize,
which can help stop tumors from growing. But in some people with advanced
NSCLC, a protein on the tumor cells can interact with certain proteins on the
immune cells. This stops the immune cells from recognizing the tumor cells and
being able to fight them.
The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were designed to stop the
tumor cells from interacting with certain proteins on the immune cells. This
lets the immune cells recognize the tumor cells and help stop the tumor from
growing.
