Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
ticagrelor, and to their parents or caregivers.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about ticagrelor to help
children and teenagers with sickle cell disease, also called SCD or sickle cell anemia.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of
the study.
An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary
of the study results. We hope it helps the participants and their parents or caregivers
understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you or the child in your care participated in the study and have questions about
the results, please speak with the study doctor or staff at your study site.
