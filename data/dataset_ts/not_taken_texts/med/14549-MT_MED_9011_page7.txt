For all of the trials, the researchers used a computer programme to randomly
choose whether the participants got AZD1222 or the control. This helps make sure
the groups are chosen equally and that the types of participants in each group are
similar. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each trial injection is
as accurate as possible.
The chart below shows how many participants received AZD1222 or the control.
United Kingdom: COV001
Total 1,077 participants
AZD1222 544 participants
MenACWY control 533 participants
United Kingdom: COV002
Brazil: COV003
Total 10,804 participants
Total 10,416 participants
AZD1222 5,593 participants
AZD1222 5,207 participants
MenACWY control 5,211 participants
MenACWY and 5,209 participants
saline control
South Africa: COV005
Total 2,125 participants
AZD1222 1,064 participants
Saline control 1,061 participants
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in these trials was:
• How effective was AZD1222 more than 14 days after the second injection?
They also wanted to find out:
• How effective was AZD1222 after the first injection?
• What were the safety results of AZD1222?
