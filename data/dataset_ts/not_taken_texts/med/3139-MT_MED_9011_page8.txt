What serious medical problems happened during the
study?
In clinical studies, researchers keep track of the medical problems that participants
have that study doctors think might be related to the study treatments. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if the participants taking ticagrelor had
serious adverse reactions. They also wanted to learn if any participants stopped taking
ticagrelor because of adverse reactions. This type of study did not require information on
all adverse reactions to be collected.
This section is a summary of the serious adverse reactions that the study doctors thought
might be related to ticagrelor.
These serious adverse reactions may or may not be caused by ticagrelor. When the
participants had these serious adverse reactions, the study doctors did not know whether
they were taking ticagrelor or the placebo.
