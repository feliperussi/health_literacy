Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study
drug dapagliflozin. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about if

AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We
hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their important role in
medical research.
