Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat a type of heart failure called HFpEF.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about how AZD4831 works in
people with HFpEF. They wanted to find out if AZD4831 reduced the activity in the
blood of a protein called MPO, also known as myeloperoxidase, which is a marker
of inflammation in the heart or blood vessels. Before a treatment can be approved
for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took AZD4831 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
treatment but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did AZD4831 reduce the activity of MPO in the blood?
The study was stopped early because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant
the researchers did not have enough data to compare the results of the
participants who took AZD4831 to the results of the participants who took the
placebo.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 9.8% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during this study.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
