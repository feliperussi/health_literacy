Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 24 to 55 years old when they joined.
The study included 37 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat the coronavirus disease, also called
COVID-19. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COVID-19 can cause swelling in the lungs and airways. This can lead to lung damage,
difficulty breathing, and other medical problems. If a patient with COVID-19 has
severe swelling, they may need a breathing tube and ventilator to help them breathe.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of cancer. But in animal
studies, researchers have found that acalabrutinib may also reduce swelling in the
lungs. The results from these animal studies suggested that acalabrutinib might be
able to decrease swelling in the lungs and airways in patients who have COVID-19.
Patients with COVID-19 who are breathing with a ventilator may have increased
stomach acid, so they are often given medications called proton-pump inhibitors
to prevent stomach ulcers. Proton-pump inhibitors reduce the amount of acid the
stomach makes. One of these proton-pump inhibitors is rabeprazole. Earlier studies
in healthy volunteers have shown that when there is less stomach acid, it is harder for
acalabrutinib to get into the blood. Drinking flat Coca-Cola adds some acid to the
stomach and may help acalabrutinib get into the blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how acalabrutinib and its
metabolite act in the blood in healthy participants when taken with rabeprazole and
flat Coca-Cola. A metabolite is a substance that the body makes when it breaks down
a drug. The body then removes metabolites through fluids such as urine and sweat.
