ABOUT THIS STUDY
Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with a type of advanced
liver cancer called “hepatocellular carcinoma”, also known as “HCC”. The
participants in this study were 26 to 89 years old when they joined.
The study included 433 participants in China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Singapore,
South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with advanced liver
cancer. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. “Advanced” cancer usually means that the cancer
continues to grow even with treatment.
Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing or surviving. But
in people with advanced HCC, some proteins on the tumor cells can interact with
certain proteins on the immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from being
able to attack the tumor cells.
The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were designed to boost the
immune system’s reaction. This helps the immune cells attack the tumor cells again
and can stop the tumor from growing or shrink the tumor. Both durvalumab and
tremelimumab are immunotherapy drugs, as they affect the immune system.
Tumors also make their own blood vessels, which help the tumors to grow.
Another study drug, bevacizumab, helps to stop tumors from making their own
blood vessels, which can also stop the tumor from growing or shrink the tumor.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of durvalumab,
tremelimumab, and bevacizumab in participants with advanced HCC.
