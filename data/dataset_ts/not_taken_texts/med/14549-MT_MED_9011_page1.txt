developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. This vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-
19 or AZD1222. It is referred to in this summary as AZD1222. All of the participants helped the
researchers learn more about AZD1222 to prevent COVID-19.
This is a summary of 1 article in The Lancet journal that was published in March 2021. The article
discusses the results from 4 trials of AZD1222. The purpose of this summary is to help you

AstraZeneca believes it is important to share the trial results. An independent non-profit
organisation called CISCRP helped prepare this summary.
