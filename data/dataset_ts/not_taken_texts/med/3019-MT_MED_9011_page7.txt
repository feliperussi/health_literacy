Clinical Study Results
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
The most common adverse reaction was diarrhea. The table below shows the most
common adverse reactions that happened in this study. The study doctors thought that
these adverse reactions were related to the study treatment, but did not know which
treatment participants were taking.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how taking RDEA3170 and febuxostat together
affect kidney function in people with type 2 diabetes who have protein in their urine.
The researchers in this study found that the amount of protein in urine was lower in
the participants who took RDEA3170 and febuxostat than in participants who took the
placebos.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with RDEA3170 are planned.
