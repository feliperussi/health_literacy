Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: Glycopyrronium / formoterol fumarate
Study Title: This study was done to learn how glycopyrronium / formoterol fumarate
worked compared with umeclidinium / vilanterol and how safe it was in
people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
glycopyrronium / formoterol fumarate, also called GFF. You and all the participants helped
researchers learn more about using GFF to help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, also called COPD.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your
important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 30 weeks. The study started in May 2017 and
ended in May 2018. The study included 1,119 participants in Bulgaria, Canada, France, Hungary,
Russia, Ukraine and the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with moderate to very severe COPD.
Researchers do clinical studies to find out how a treatment works and how safe it is. In this
study, researchers wanted to find out if GFF works at least as well as umeclidinium / vilanterol,
also called UV, in a large number of participants with moderate to very severe COPD. They also
wanted to find out if the participants taking GFF had any different medical problems during the
study compared with those taking UV.
COPD is a long-term condition that causes the airways to narrow. This makes it difficult
to breathe. There are treatments for COPD to help people breathe more easily, but these
treatments do not work well for everyone with moderate to very severe COPD.
