Did the participants feel that AZD7594 helped them control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took AZD7594 felt
that it helped them control their asthma compared to the participants who took the
placebo.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to answer a
questionnaire about their asthma symptoms. The questionnaire is called the
Asthma Control Questionnaire-5, also called ACQ-5. The participants received
scores from 0 to 5 based on their responses. A higher score on the ACQ-5 means
asthma symptoms are less controlled. The researchers compared the average
score after 12 weeks of treatment to the average score before the participants
started taking treatment.
