Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: AZD9977
Study Title: A study to learn more about how different forms of AZD9977 act
in the blood of healthy participants and if AZD9977 is safe to take
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD9977. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how
different forms of AZD9977 act in the blood of healthy participants.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in March 2018 and ended in June 2018. The study included
13 participants in the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with heart failure. Before a drug
can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out if it works
and how safe it is.
The study drug, AZD9977, is being developed to treat patients with heart failure. In this
study, the researchers wanted to find out how different forms of AZD9977 acted in the
blood of healthy male participants. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
