Clinical Study Results
Overall, the researchers found that dapagliflozin did not change the amount of glucose that left
the participants’ blood compared with the placebo.
During the study, none of the participants had any medical problems that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study treatment.

Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with T2DM. When they joined the study,
the participants could already be taking:
• a T2DM treatment called metformin
• a type of treatment called a DPP-IV inhibitor
• no T2DM treatment at all
The participants in this study were 56 to 71 years old when they joined and did not have any
other serious medical conditions.
The study included 26 participants in the Netherlands.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with T2DM. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe
it is.
Researchers already did studies that showed that dapagliflozin worked for the people with T2DM
who were in those studies.
In people with T2DM, the body does not respond well to insulin and does not make enough
insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the level of blood sugar, which is also called glucose.
T2DM causes blood glucose levels to rise to higher than normal levels. This can cause medical
problems.
The study drug, dapagliflozin, works by helping the kidneys remove glucose from the blood and
clear it away through the urine. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin
affected how much glucose left the participants’ blood.
