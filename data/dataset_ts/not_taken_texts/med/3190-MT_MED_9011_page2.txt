Clinical Study Results
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate are drugs that are already approved to
treat COPD. But, these 3 drugs are not yet approved to take together in an inhaler treatment.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• How did the inhaler treatment of the 3 combined drugs act in the body?
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew what
the participants were taking.
What happened during this study?
Before this study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination to make sure the participants could join this study
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
Once the participants joined this study, it could take a few weeks before they went back to the
study site to start the study treatment.
During this study, the participants visited their study site 5 times.
They took the study treatment:
• once on Day 1
• twice each day from Day 2 through Day 7
• once on Day 8
All of the participants took the same dose of the study treatment.
At the end of this study, the doctors called the participants and asked how they were feeling.
