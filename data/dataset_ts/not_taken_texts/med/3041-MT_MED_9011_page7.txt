How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how dapagliflozin affects people with T2D and
healthy kidneys.
The researchers could not fully answer the questions in this study for the participants who did
not have T2D but had low functioning kidneys. But, the researchers will still be able to use the
information learned in this study for future studies.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with dapagliflozin are ongoing and planned.
