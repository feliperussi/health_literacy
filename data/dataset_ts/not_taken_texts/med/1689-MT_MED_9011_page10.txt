Clinical Study Results
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for the treatments.
Of the 188 participants in this study, there were 4 participants who did not receive
treatment. This was because they did not meet the study guidelines or the study
doctors accidentally found out the treatment given to them. So, the below results
are for only 184 of the 188 participants.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
