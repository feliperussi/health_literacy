Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat leukemia. Before a treatment
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is.
Leukemia is a type of cancer that develops slowly. In people with lymphocytic
leukemia, the bone marrow is not able to control the growth of a type of white
blood cell called “lymphocytes”. This can cause symptoms such as frequent
infections, swollen lymph nodes, and tiredness.
In people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the cancer cells are mostly in the
blood and bone marrow.
In people with small lymphocytic leukemia, the cancer cells are mostly in the
lymph nodes.
Many people with either type of lymphocytic leukemia respond to standard
treatment or do not need treatment at all. But, some people have a form of
lymphocytic leukemia that does not always respond to standard treatment. This
is why researchers are looking for other treatment options that work in different
ways. The study treatment, acalabrutinib, is designed to kill blood cancer cells
by stopping certain proteins that help these cells live and grow.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if acalabrutinib works in a
small number of participants with leukemia. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
