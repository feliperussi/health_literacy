How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about olaparib, ceralasertib, and
adavosertib in participants with metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The
study also helped researchers understand more about how patients with different
genetic mutations respond to different potential cancer treatments.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with the combination of olaparib and ceralasertib or
olaparib and adavosertib for metastatic triple negative breast cancer were not
planned at the time this summary was written.
