The researchers compared the results from Treatment 1 when the participants
took a separate capsule and tablet with the results from Treatment 2 when
the participants took a combined capsule. They took each of these treatments
after fasting. For this question, the researchers looked at the results only from
Treatments 1 and 2 because they only wanted to see if there was a difference
between separate and combined capsules and tablets. The results for
Treatments 3, 4, and 5 were used to answer other questions that are not in this
summary because they were not part of the main question.
Overall, the researchers found that the average highest amount of:
X verinurad in the blood was higher when the participants took a combined
capsule compared to when they took a separate capsule and tablet
X allopurinol in the blood was similar when the participants took a
combined capsule and when they took a separate capsule and tablet
X oxypurinol in the blood was lower when the participants took a combined
capsule compared to when they took a separate capsule and tablet
Overall, the researchers found that the average total amount in the blood
over time of verinurad, allopurinol, and oxypurinol was similar when the
participants took a combined capsule and when they took a separate capsule
and tablet.
