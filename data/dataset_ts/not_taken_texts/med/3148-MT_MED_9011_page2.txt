Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Which new formulation of AZD5718 acted the most like the AZD5718 tablets that
were tested in previous studies?
• Did taking AZD5718 with food change the way AZD5718 behaved in the body?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
These questions are important to answer before more studies can be done to find out if
AZD5718 improves the health of people with CAD.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women, but only men joined the
study. Everyone in the study was 25 to 51 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was taking.
Each participant took 5 different formulations of AZD5718 tablets. The tablets were
made in different ways or had different amounts of AZD5718 in them.
• Formulation 1: These tablets each had 100 milligrams, also called mg, of
AZD5718. The participants took 2 of these tablets, for a total dose of 200 mg. This
formulation of the tablet had been tested in another study.
• Formulations 2, 3, and 4: These tablets each had 100 mg of AZD5718. The
participants took 2 of each of these types of tablets, for a total dose of 200 mg for
each tablet formulation. These formulations were all new and had not been tested in
other studies.
• Formulation 5: These tablets each had 50 mg of AZD5718. The participants took
1 of these tablets, for a total dose of 50 mg. This formulation was also new and had
not been tested in other studies.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that participants received
each of the formulations. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
formulation was as accurate as possible.
