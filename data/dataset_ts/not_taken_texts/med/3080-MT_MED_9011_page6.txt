What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the study results.
There was 1 participant who did not get any doses of AZD2811. So, the results
below are for 50 out of 51 participants.
What was the highest dose of AZD2811 that did not cause too many
side effects?
Because the study ended early, the researchers did not collect enough data to
answer this question.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and
after the participants got AZD2811. The doctors did physical exams and tested
the participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall health. They also
did ECGs to check the participants’ heart health.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if
they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
