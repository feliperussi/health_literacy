Clinical Study Results
Did AZD0284 help decrease the amounts of IL-17A and CCL20 in the body?
Because of the small number of participants in the study, the researchers could not
determine if AZD0284 helped decrease the amounts of these proteins.
To answer this question, the study doctors took samples of the participants’ skin
plaques before they took treatment and after 4 weeks of taking treatment. The
researchers compared the amounts of IL-17A and CCL20 in the samples of the
participants who took AZD0284 with the amounts of IL-17A and CCL20 in the
samples of the participants who took the placebo.
Did AZD0284 help decrease the itchiness of the participants’ skin plaques?
Because of the small number of participants in the study, the researchers could
not determine if AZD0284 helped decrease the itchiness of the participants’ skin
plaques.
To answer this question, the researchers gave the participants a survey called
the Pruritus Visual Analogue Score, also called pVAS. This survey asked the
participants to rate how itchy their skin plaques were. Based on the rating, the
study doctors gave the participants a score from 0 to 10. The higher the score, the
more severe the itchiness was. The researchers compared the results of the pVAS
before the participants took treatment and after 4 weeks of taking treatment. They
compared the scores of the participants who took AZD0284 with the scores of the
participants who took the placebo.
