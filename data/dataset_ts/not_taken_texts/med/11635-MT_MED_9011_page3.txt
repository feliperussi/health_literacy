Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with high levels of
potassium in their blood. This condition is also called “hyperkalemia”.
People with high levels of potassium in their blood often don’t have any
symptoms that can easily be seen, but they may have problems with their
heartbeat. This can be dangerous. In rare cases, it can lead to death.
High blood potassium can be caused by certain medicines. These include
tacrolimus and cyclosporin, which are designed to decrease the activity of the
immune system. Decreasing the activity of the immune system is important in
treating some diseases, or to avoid complications after an organ transplant.
Researchers think that the study drug, SZC, could help prevent high blood
potassium in people taking tacrolimus and cyclosporin.
But, SZC can make the stomach less acidic. This can make it harder for some
other medicines to get into the blood, and can be a problem for people who
take multiple medicines.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if taking SZC affected how much
tacrolimus or cyclosporin got into the participants’ blood.
