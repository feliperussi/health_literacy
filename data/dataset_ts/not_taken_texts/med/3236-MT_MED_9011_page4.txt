The study happened in 2 parts. In Part A, the participants received a single dose
injection of study treatment. The single dose could have been given through
several injections. In Part A:
X 36 participants received 1 of 5 different doses of MEDI6570
X 12 participants received the placebo
The early results of Part A were used to decide which doses of MEDI6570 should
be used in Part B. In Part B, the participants received a total of 3 doses, which
were given once a month for a total of 3 months. Each dose could have been
given through several injections. In Part B:
X 30 participants received 1 of 3 different doses of MEDI6570
X 10 participants received the placebo
