Clinical Study Results
There were 10.0% of participants who stopped taking treatment because of adverse
reactions. This was 3 out of 30 participants. This was 1 participant in Part A, when
they were taking adavosertib with caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam. This was
2 participants in Part B, when they were taking adavosertib.
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
The most common adverse reactions were diarrhea, feeling sick, and vomiting.
The table below shows the most common adverse reactions that happened in more than
2 participants who took adavosertib during the study. There were other adverse reactions,
but these happened in fewer participants. The researchers thought that these were
related to the study treatment.
