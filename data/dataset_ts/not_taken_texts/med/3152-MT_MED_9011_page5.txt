• did an eye exam
• took samples of blood, urine, and the fluid that surrounds the brain and the
spinal cord
• took pictures of the participants’ tumors using CT and MRI scans
• checked the participants’ heart health using an echocardiogram and an
electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• checked how well the participants were able to do their usual daily activities
• asked the participants about their symptoms
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the
study.
While the participants were getting study treatment, they visited their
study site 5 times. This part of the study lasted for up to 5 weeks. At these visits,
the study doctors:
• gave the participants radio-labelled osimertinib as an IV infusion
• gave the participants normal osimertinib as a tablet
• did a PET scan
The participants received their IV infusion at 3 visits and a single normal
osimertinib tablet at 2 visits. The participants also took normal osimertinib once a
day at home between their second and fourth visits to the study site.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants. This
part of the study lasted for up to 6 weeks.
All of the participants also had the option to continue taking normal osimertinib
tablets once a day after the main part of the study ended for as long as the study
doctors thought the treatment was helping, or until the participants decided to
stop taking the treatment. If they chose to continue taking normal osimertinib
tablets, the participants visited the study site 6 weeks after taking their last normal
osimertinib tablet. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants.
