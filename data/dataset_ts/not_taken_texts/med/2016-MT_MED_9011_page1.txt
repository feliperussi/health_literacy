Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: AZD8601
Study title: A study to learn if AZD8601 is safe to take
for patients with type 2 diabetes
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
AZD8601. This drug is being developed to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. The
study started in December 2016 and ended in January 2018.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat wounds in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study. This information is important to know before other studies
can be done that help find out if AZD8601 improves the health of patients with
type 2 diabetes.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the participants
were getting but the participants did not.
There were 2 parts in this study, Part A and Part B. Participants could only be in 1
part of this study. Participants in part A got either AZD8601 and placebo injections or
placebo injections only. Participants in part B got both AZD8601 and placebo injections.
