Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with 1 of 3 different types
of cancer:
> acute myeloid leukemia, also called AML
> diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, also called DLBCL
> multiple myeloma, also called MM
The participants in this study were 32 to 88 years old when they joined.
The study included 67 participants in France, the Republic of Korea, and the
United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer of the blood, bone
marrow, or lymph nodes. Before a drug can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of
cells. Acute myeloid leukemia, also called AML, is a blood cancer that starts in
the bone marrow, the soft inner part of certain bones, where new blood cells
are made. From the bone marrow, the cancer cells can move quickly to the
blood. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, also called DLBCL, is a cancer that starts
in the lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that help the body fight
infection and disease. Multiple myeloma, also called MM, is a blood cancer that
starts in white blood cells other than lymphocytes.
The cancer cells in people with AML, DLBCL, or MM produce more of a protein
called ASCT2 than normal cells. The study treatment, MEDI7247, is toxic to cancer
cells. MEDI7247 works by attaching itself to ASCT2 proteins at the surface of
cancer cells, and then entering and killing the cells. In this study, the researchers
wanted to learn more about the safety of MEDI7247 in participants with AML,
DLBCL, or MM.
