Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took their treatment through an MDI, also called a metered dose
inhaler. An MDI is a device that delivers a specific amount of a treatment for the participant to
breathe in. The participants took 2 puffs of their treatment twice a day.
The participants took either:
• a “standard” dose of BGF MDI
• a “low” dose of BGF MDI
• GFF MDI
• BFF MDI
The doses were measured in micrograms, also known as µg. These are shown in the chart
below.
Dose of
Dose of Dose of formoterol
budesonide glycopyrronium fumarate
Standard dose of BGF MDI 320 μg 14.4 μg 9.6 μg
Low dose of BGF MDI 160 μg 14.4 μg 9.6 μg
GFF MDI None 14.4 μg 9.6 μg
BFF MDI 320 μg None 9.6 μg
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors,
or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the
study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants
took so they could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
