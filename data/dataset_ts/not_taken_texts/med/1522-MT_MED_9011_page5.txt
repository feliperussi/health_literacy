Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main study results. The results each participant had might be
different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers wanted to
answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of
the study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did any participants’ have their tumors shrink enough after getting
tremelimumab?
Yes. Overall, researchers found that for some participants their tumors shrank enough
after getting tremelimumab. This did not happen for every participant.
To answer this question, the doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors using MRI
or CT before and after Part 1. The doctors measured the change in the participants’
tumors after 12 months of treatment with tremelimumab. To do this, they used a set of
rules called Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also called RECIST. This
was done to find out how much the tumor shrank or grew. It was also used to check if
other new tumors were growing.
Overall, the researchers found that a small number of participants had their tumors
shrink enough after getting tremelimumab:
• 18.8% of participants with bladder cancer had their tumors shrink enough. This was 6 out
of 32 participants.
• 8.3% of participants with triple negative breast cancer had their tumors shrink enough.
This was 1 out of 12 participants.
• None of the 20 participants with pancreatic cancer had their tumors shrink enough.
