Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how benralizumab affects
breathing in a large number of participants with severe asthma that was not well controlled
by previous treatment. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
Asthma is a disease that can cause swelling in the lungs, which can make it difficult to
breathe. Benralizumab is used to treat asthma by reducing this swelling.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did benralizumab affect the participants’ breathing?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and
women with severe asthma that was not well controlled by their previous treatment. The
participants in this study were 19 to 75 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done this way
because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of
the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment
participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants got either benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by
the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
