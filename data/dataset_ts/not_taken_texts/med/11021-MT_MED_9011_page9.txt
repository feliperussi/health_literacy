Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
There was 1 participant who left the study before the researchers finished
recording the medical problems that happened during the study. This participant
left because they did not follow the study guidelines. So, some of the below results
are for only 66 of the 67 participants.
