Clinical Study Results
The participants in the study took either ZS or a placebo by mouth. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take a drug are actually caused by that drug. The participants took either ZS or
the placebo as a powder mixed with water.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
The participants visited their study site 5 times during the study.
Visit 1 and Visit 2
During the first 2 visits, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
The study doctors also reviewed the consent form with the participants and
answered any questions they had before the participants agreed to take part
in the study.
The participants could only continue the study if the study doctors determined the
participants were healthy enough to receive treatment.
After the health checks during the second visit, the participants who were healthy
enough to continue took 1 of the below doses 3 times a day:
• 34 participants took 5 grams, also known as g, of ZS powder with water
• 36 participants took 10 g of ZS powder with water
• 33 participants took a placebo with water
Visit 3
During the third visit, the participants took the same doses they took during the
second visit. The researchers also checked the health of the participants again
during this visit.
