Clinical Trial Results
Amount of AZD2014 that left the body
The AZD2014 with a radioactive tag helped researchers measure the amount of AZD2014 that
left the body through urine, faeces, saliva, and vomit. Researchers found the following:
• AZD2014 left the body mainly through the faeces about 72 hours.
• About 80.0% of the radioactive AZD2014 was found in the faeces, and about 12.0% was
found in the urine.
How did tumours react to AZD2014 treatment?
Researchers also wanted to know how many participants had their tumours shrink or disappear
after AZD2014 treatment. They also wanted to know how many participants had their disease
stay the same or get worse. In this study, getting worse meant that tumours grew or spread to
other areas. Researchers found the following:
• No participants had their tumours shrink or disappear.
• 100.0%, or all 3 of the participants who took AZD2014 alone, had their disease
stay about the same.
• The 1 participant who took AZD2014 and fulvestrant had worsening of disease.
What medical problems did participants have after they
took AZD2014?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem, so researchers
keep track of all medical problems that participants had during the study. These medical
problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
During this study, all 4 participants (100%) had medical problems. No participants stopped
study treatment because of medical problems. The table below shows how many participants
in each treatment group had medical problems.
