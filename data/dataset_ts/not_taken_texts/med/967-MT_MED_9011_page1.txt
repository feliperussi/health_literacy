Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drugs
dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn
more about how these drugs affect the hemoglobin A1c, also known as HbA1c, levels
in the blood of people with type 2 diabetes who were already taking metformin.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the
study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 27 weeks. But the entire study took
about a year and a half to finish.
The study started in February 2016 and ended in July 2017. The study included 883
participants in Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, the Russian Federation,
and the United States. The information for participants from 1 site was not included in the
final results because the researchers were not able to accurately collect the data.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report
of the results. This is a summary of that report.
