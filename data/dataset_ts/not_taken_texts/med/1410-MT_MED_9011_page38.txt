Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. This section is a
summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the study
drugs or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the drugs in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
