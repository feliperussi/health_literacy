Clinical Trial RESULTS
After treatment:
• Participants who took fludrocortisone and placebo had a difference
between sodium and potassium of -4.09. The researchers thought this would
happen because fludrocortisone decreases the amount of sodium in urine
and also increases the amount of potassium in urine.
• Participants who took fludrocortisone, AZD9977, and placebo had a
difference between sodium and potassium of -0.69. This made it seem like
AZD9977 had an effect on how fludrocortisone worked in the body.
• Participants who took fludrocortisone, eplerenone, and placebo had a
difference between sodium and potassium of -0.55. This made it seem like
eplerenone had an effect on how fludrocortisone worked in the body.
• Participants who took fludrocortisone, eplerenone, and AZD9977 had
a difference between sodium and potassium of 0.69. This made it seem
like eplerenone and AZD9977 worked together in how they affected the
difference between sodium and potassium in the urine.
The graph below shows the differences between sodium and potassium before and
after treatment.
