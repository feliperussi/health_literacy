What happened during the study?
Up to 28 days before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study
site once. At this visit, the doctors checked the overall health of the participants to make
sure that they could join the study. The doctors:
• asked the participants about their health and about any medications they were taking
• did a physical exam
• checked the participants’ blood pressure
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
During each treatment period, the participants stayed overnight at their study site
for 5 days. They took 1 dose of verinurad in the morning on Day 2 of each treatment
period.
After the participants finished taking study treatment, they visited their study site
once more, up to 14 days after their last dose.
