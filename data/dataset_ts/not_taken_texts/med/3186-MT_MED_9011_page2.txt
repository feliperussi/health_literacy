Clinical Study Results
Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, also
called COPD. Before a treatment can be approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took 1 of 4 treatments through an inhaler:
• a “standard” dose of BGF MDI
• a “low” dose of BGF MDI
• GFF MDI
• BFF MDI
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants who took BGF MDI have COPD flare-ups less often?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took BGF MDI had COPD
flare-ups less often than those who took GFF MDI or BFF MDI.
• Did the participants feel their quality of life changed after taking BGF MDI?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took BGF MDI felt that it
helped their quality of life compared to those who took GFF MDI or BFF MDI.
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 9.3% of participants who had medical problems during the study that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. The most common medical
problem was a yeast infection around the mouth.
