What medical problems did the participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
