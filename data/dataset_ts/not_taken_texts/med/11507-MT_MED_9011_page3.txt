Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to treat the coronavirus disease, also called
COVID-19. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can cause swelling in the airways and lungs.
This can lead to lung damage, difficulty breathing, and other medical problems.
If the swelling is severe, people who have COVID-19 may have a breathing tube
inserted and may not be able to swallow a pill. They may also have increased
stomach acid while they have a breathing tube in.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of cancer. But, in
animal studies, researchers have found that acalabrutinib may also reduce swelling
in the lungs. The results from these animal studies showed that acalabrutinib
might be able to decrease swelling in the lungs and airways.
Acalabrutinib has been available as a capsule for some time. In a capsule
medication, the drug is inside a shell that is broken down in the gut to release the
drug. Researchers have also now developed acalabrutinib as a tablet. In a tablet
medication, the drug is packed in a pill without a shell.
Patients who have a breathing tube are often given antacids known as “proton-
pump inhibitors” to reduce stomach acid and prevent ulcers. Earlier studies in
healthy participants have shown that when there is less stomach acid, it is harder
for acalabrutinib to get into the blood when given as a capsule. Drinking flat Coca-
Cola adds some acid to the stomach. This may help acalabrutinib, when given
as a capsule, get into the blood. Acalabrutinib as a tablet is expected to be less
affected by stomach acid than acalabrutinib as a capsule.
