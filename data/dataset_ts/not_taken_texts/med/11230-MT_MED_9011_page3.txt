What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants got cotadutide through a needle under the
skin. This is also known as a subcutaneous injection. All of the participants got
injections into 3 different parts of their body during the study. This could be in
the belly, arm, or thigh. The dose of each cotadutide injection was measured in
micrograms, also known as µg.
There were 6 groups of participants, and each group got the injections in a
different order. All the participants got the same dose of 100 µg of cotadutide.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what order of injection each participant was
getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that each
participant would get their injections. This helps make sure the groups are
chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
treatment is as accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments that the participants got during the study.
36 participants
6 groups of 6 participants
1 injection each into the belly, arm, and thigh
100 µg of cotadutide in each injection
Injections under the skin once a week,
for around 3 weeks
