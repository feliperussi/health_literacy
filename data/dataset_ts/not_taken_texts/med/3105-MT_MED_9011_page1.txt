Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD0284. AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in November 2017 and ended in November 2018. The study
included 9 participants.
The researchers planned to include 25 participants in this study. But they ended
the study early, because at that time, they decided to stop researching AZD0284 in
participants who have plaque psoriasis.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
