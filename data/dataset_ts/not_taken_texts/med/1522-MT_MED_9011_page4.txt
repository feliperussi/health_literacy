Clinical Study Results
During the study, the participants visited their study site every 4 weeks. There were a
total of 13 visits in each part. During Part 1, all of the participants got tremelimumab.
During Part 2, the eligible participants got either durvalumab, or tremelimumab and
durvalumab.
At each visit, the doctors checked the health of the participants and took blood and
urine samples.
At most visits, the doctors measured the participants’ tumor size using CT or MRI.
After the participants got the last dose of treatment, they visited the clinic
3 times, once a month for up to 3 months. The doctors checked on the participants’
health, measured the participants’ tumors, and took blood and urine samples. After
this, doctors checked on the health of participants every 2 months. This was done by
a phone call or by a study visit. If the participant’s cancer got worse, they could go on
to receive another 12 months of study treatment in Part 1 or Part 2. This was done in
discussion with the doctor and also depended on if certain criteria were met.
