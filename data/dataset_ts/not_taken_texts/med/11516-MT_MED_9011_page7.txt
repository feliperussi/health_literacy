How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how acalabrutinib acts in the
blood when given by a nasogastric tube with a proton pump inhibitor in patients
with COVID-19 who need hospital care.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with acalabrutinib for patients with COVID-19 are not
planned.
