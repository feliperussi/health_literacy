Benralizumab Placebo
Did the participants feel that benralizumab helped their health-related
quality of life and helped them control their asthma symptoms?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got benralizumab
felt that it helped their health-related quality of life and helped them control their
asthma symptoms compared with the participants who got the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers asked the participants to complete
several different questionnaires throughout the study. Then, the researchers
compared the participantsâ€™ answers after 24 weeks of getting study treatment with
their answers before getting any study treatment.
