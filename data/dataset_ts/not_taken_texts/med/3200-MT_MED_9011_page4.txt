Total amounts of EPA and DHA in the blood over 24 hours
For both EPA and DHA, the total amounts in the participants’ blood over 24 hours after they
took omega-3 carboxylic acids for 14 days were about 4 times the total amounts after they
took a single dose of omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day.
The chart below shows the total amounts of EPA and DHA in the blood over 24 hours
after they took omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day and for 14 days. These amounts are
measured in hours multiplied by micrograms per milliliter of blood, also called h•μg/mL.

How long it took for EPA and DHA to reach their highest levels in the blood
It took about the same amount of time for EPA and DHA to reach their highest levels in the
participants’ blood after they took omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day and for 14 days.
The chart below shows how long it took for EPA and DHA to reach their highest levels
in the blood after participants took omega-3 carboxylic acids for 1 day and for 14 days.
This is measured in hours.
