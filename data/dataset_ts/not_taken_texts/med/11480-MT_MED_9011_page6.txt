A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment group for
each participant, as well as the order in which the participants took their study
treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The dose of the study treatments was measured in milligrams, also known as
“mg”. The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
