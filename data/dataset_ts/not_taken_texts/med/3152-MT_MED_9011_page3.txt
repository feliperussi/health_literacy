This made it easier for the researchers to monitor how osimertinib acted in the
participants’ brains.
This was a “phase 1” study. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how
radio-labelled osimertinib acts in the brains of participants with NSCLC that has
spread to the brain.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much radio-labelled osimertinib got into the participants’ brains when
given at different times during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if osimertinib helps improve the health of people with NSCLC
that has spread to the brain.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants were planned to get both “normal” osimertinib and
radio-labelled osimertinib.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
Normal osimertinib was taken as a tablet by mouth. Radio-labelled osimertinib
was given through a needle into a vein, also known as an IV infusion. The
participants got radio-labelled osimertinib at 3 different times:
• for dose 1, they got radio-labelled osimertinib by itself
• for dose 2, they took 1 normal osimertinib tablet just before they got
radio-labelled osimertinib
• for dose 3, they took 1 normal osimertinib tablet once a day for at least 3
weeks, then they got the third dose of radio-labelled osimertinib
