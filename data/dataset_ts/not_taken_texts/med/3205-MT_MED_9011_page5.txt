Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment for each
participant during Part 2. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants were given.

What happened during the study?
The participants were in the study for up to about 4 months. But, the entire study
took about 1 year to finish. The study started in September 2018 and ended in
December 2019.
The participants visited their study site 1 time within 1 month of the start of the
study. At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could
join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants’ body weight
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an
ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking other than metformin
