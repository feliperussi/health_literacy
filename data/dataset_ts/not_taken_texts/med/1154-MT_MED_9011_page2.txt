Clinical Trial RESULTS
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in June 2015 and ended in January 2016. It included 300
participants at 3 study sites in the United States. When the study ended, the
sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary
of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be approved, research must be done to show that it is
safe and effective. The FluMist® Quadrivalent nasal spray vaccine is approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, known as the FDA, for the prevention of
influenza, which is commonly referred to as the flu. The flu is caused by a virus
that infects your nose, throat, and lungs. The main symptoms of the flu are
fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose, and tiredness. Each
year different strains of flu can cause illness so all influenza vaccines have to be
adjusted to protect people against these new strains. FluMist® Quadrivalent
contains 4 vaccine strains but each year all new strains have to be tested in
healthy people for safety before the vaccine can be used.
In this study, researchers tested 3 vaccine strains. Two strains were new. The third
was a newer version of a strain used in the 2015 flu season vaccine. Researchers
compared these 3 vaccine strains with a placebo. The placebo looked like the flu
vaccine but contained no real medicine. Researchers use placebos in studies to
compare the results for participants who take study drugs with the results for
participants who take no medicine at all.
Researchers wanted to know:
• Were the fever rates comparable between the participants who
got the 3 strain vaccine and those who got the placebo?
• Did more participants have vaccine side effects within 7 days
of getting the 3 strain vaccine, compared to the placebo?
• What medical problems did participants have after getting
the 3 strain vaccine?
Your study included healthy men and women who were 18 to 49 years old.
