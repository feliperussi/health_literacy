Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Diabetes is a disease that makes your blood sugar levels rise above normal. This can
cause serious health problems such as eye, kidney, and nerve diseases. Type 2 diabetes
is the most common form of diabetes. Researchers want to find new treatments, because
the treatments used now do not work well for everyone.
Before patients can take a new drug, the company that develops it must do research
studies to show it is safe and effective. In this study, researchers learned about taking
drugs called dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. These drugs are already approved to treat
type 2 diabetes. There were also 2 other diabetes drugs used in this study, metformin
and glimepiride. Researchers wanted to learn how different doses of dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin affected patients who were already taking metformin.
Researchers also used a placebo in this study. A placebo looks like the study drug but
contains no real medicine. Researchers use placebos in studies to compare the results for
participants who take study drugs to the results for participants who take no medicine at all.
Researchers in your study wanted to know:
• Did blood sugar levels change for participants who got the different drugs?
• Did the different drugs affect participants in other ways?
• What medical problems did participants have after they got the different drugs?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants, study
doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment each participant takes can affect the results of the
study. This way, the results are looked at fairly.
Your study included 937 men and women with type 2 diabetes. All of them were 31 to
75 years of age. Everyone in your study was also taking a diabetes drug called
metformin, but needed more treatment to keep blood sugar levels from rising too high.
What happened during the study?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to 55 weeks.
You visited the study site up to 14 times.
