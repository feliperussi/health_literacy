The results below are for the 4 out of 8 participants who completed the study.
How much radio-labelled osimertinib got into the participants’ brains
when given at different times during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers took brain images and blood samples
after the participants got an IV infusion of radio-labelled osimertinib. The
participants got radio-labelled osimertinib at 3 different times:
• before the participants took any normal osimertinib tablet
• right after the participants took 1 normal osimertinib tablet
• after the participants had taken 1 normal osimertinib tablet once a day for at
least 3 weeks
Overall, the researchers found that a similar amount of radio-labelled osimertinib
got into the participants’ brains at all 3 time points. They also found that it spread
similarly throughout the different regions of the brain.
