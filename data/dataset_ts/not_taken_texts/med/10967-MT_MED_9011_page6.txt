Clinical Study Results
Overall, the researchers found that these amounts were higher when the
participants took AZD9977 with food during Part B.
How did the different doses of AZD9977 act in the blood?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the amounts of AZD9977 in the
blood:
• after the participants took 50 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 without food in Part B
• after the participants took 300 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 without food in Part A
Overall, the researchers found that these amounts were higher when the
participants took 300 mg of AZD9977 compared to when they took 50 mg.
What medical problems did the participants
have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
