What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions that researchers asked
during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of
many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients.
Further clinical studies with exenatide are not planned in Korea.
How many and what type of medical problems did participants have when
taking exenatide?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So,
when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems
that participants have during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse
events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems in the study?
The results below are for 104 participants in this study.
Of the 104 participants, 55 (52.9%) had medical problems during the study.
Six participants (5.5%) stopped taking the study drug because of a medical problem.
How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting
problems, causes hospitalization, or is an important medical event. During the study,
4 of the 104 participants (3.8%) had serious medical problems. No participants died
during the study. Researchers did not find any new safety problems.
