CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155
WHY WAS THE STUDY DONE?
In this study, researchers wanted to test if an intravenous drug called inebilizumab, which is administered
into a vein, would help to treat people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, also known as NMO
or NMOSD. Additionally, they wanted to find out what side effects people had when they were given
inebilizumab infusions during the study.
NMOSD is a rare condition which affects the nerves of the eyes, called the optic nerves. Patients
with NMOSD experience attacks of the condition such as eye pain, loss of vision, and in-patient
hospitalizations.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:

OVERALL RESULTS
The results of this study showed that participants treated with inebilizumab
infusions had a significant reduction in the risk of having an NMOSD-related attack.
Inebilizumab infusions were found to be safe and generally well-tolerated.
