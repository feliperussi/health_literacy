Clinical Study Results
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with asthma who had at least 1 asthma
attack in the past year that required treatment. The participants were taking at least 1 asthma
medication for at least 3 months before joining the study.
The participants in the study were 25 to 72 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew what
treatment the participants were getting.
All of the participants had severe, uncontrolled asthma, and were taking medication for it.
All of the participants in the study got tralokinumab through an injection under the skin.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• checked the lung health of the participants
• asked the participants about their medical history and asthma symptoms
• asked the participants how they were feeling and what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants were scheduled to get 2 tralokinumab injections once every
2 weeks for 50 weeks. Each injection had a dose of 150 milligrams, also known as mg, of
tralokinumab. All 28 participants got at least 1 dose of the study drug. Two of the 28 participants
finished the treatment period, but none of the participants finished the study.
At the end of the study, the participants were scheduled to visit their study site twice for follow-up
visits. This was so that the doctors could check the participants’ health again and ask about their
asthma symptoms.
