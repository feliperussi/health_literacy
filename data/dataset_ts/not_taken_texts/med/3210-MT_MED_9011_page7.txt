Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant who left the study before taking any treatment. So, the
results below include information for 805 out of 806 participants.
Did different doses of AZD7594 affect the amount of air the participants
could breathe out?
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of air the
participants breathed out in 1 second. This was measured in milliliters, also called
mL. The study doctors compared the average amount breathed out after 12 weeks
of treatment to the average amount breathed out before the participants started
taking treatment.
The researchers found that in each treatment group, there was a change in the
amount of air that the participants breathed out after 12 weeks of treatment. At
some doses, the participants who took AZD7594 breathed out more air after 12
weeks. The participants who took the placebo and FF also breathed out more air
after 12 weeks. But, the differences between treatment groups were too small for
the researchers to know if AZD7594 affected the participantsâ€™ breathing compared
to the placebo.
