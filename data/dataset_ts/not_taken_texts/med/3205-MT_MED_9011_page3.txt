Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who have type 2 diabetes
and were overweight or had obesity. These men and women were already taking
a type 2 diabetes drug called metformin. The participants were 45 to 74 years old
when they joined.
The study included 28 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 2 diabetes in people who
are overweight or have obesity. Before a drug can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In people who have type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or
it does not respond to insulin as well as it should. Insulin is a hormone made by the
pancreas that controls the levels of sugar in the blood. A common cause of type 2
diabetes is being overweight or having obesity.
Body weight may be lost by decreasing the number of calories a person takes in
by following a diet, or by burning off calories through exercise. But, people who are
overweight or have obesity may find it difficult to lose body weight.
There are several treatments available for people who have type 2 diabetes that
may help them control their insulin and blood sugar. But, many of these treatments
do not help them lose body weight.
The study drug, MEDI0382, is being developed to lower blood sugar levels and
body weight. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if MEDI0382 helped
the participants to lose body weight. They also wanted to find out if MEDI0382
affected the participantsâ€™ calorie intake, how many calories they burned off, and if
they had any medical problems during the study.
