Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat T2DM. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well dapagliflozin, saxagliptin,
and metformin work together in a large number of participants with T2DM to lower
blood sugar levels. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
In people with T2DM, the body does not make enough insulin. Insulin controls the
level of blood sugar, which is also called glucose. T2DM causes blood glucose
levels to rise higher than normal. This can cause medical problems.
Blood glucose levels can be measured by looking at a protein in red blood cells
called hemoglobin. In people with T2DM, the hemoglobin changes shape and is
called HbA1c when red blood cells are carrying glucose. Lower levels of HbA1c
mean improved blood glucose levels.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how 3 approved T2DM treatments,
dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin, affected HbA1c levels in participants
with T2DM when taken together. These participants had high levels of HbA1c.
The researchers compared these treatments to another approved T2DM treatment
called glimepiride, taken with metformin. All of the participants were already taking
metformin before they started the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the HbA1c levels in the participants’ blood decrease after 1 year?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women with T2DM. The participants in this study were aged 27 to 78 and did
not have any other serious heart, kidney, or liver problems. The participants were
already taking at least 1,500 milligrams of metformin for at least 8 weeks before the
study, but their blood glucose levels were still not under control.
