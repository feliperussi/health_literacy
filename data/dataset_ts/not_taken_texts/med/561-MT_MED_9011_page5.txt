Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Up to 4 weeks before the participants took treatment, the participants
visited their study site 2 times. The study doctors checked the overall health of the
participants to make sure that they could join the study. The study doctors:
• asked about the participants’ health and did a physical exam
• asked about any medications the participants were taking
• gave the participants advice about diet and exercise
• took blood and urine samples from the participants
• tested the participants’ HbA1c levels
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
Some participants may have also been in other parts of the study. In one part,
some participants got a wearable continuous glucose monitoring device, also
called a CGM device. In another part, some participants had magnetic resonance
imaging scans, also called MRI scans. These participants may have had more
study site visits.
During the first year of the study, the participants visited their study site 9
times. The participants kept a study diary and completed several questionnaires.
At each site visit, the study doctors checked the participants’ health. At the first 4
visits, the participants taking glimepiride may have had their dose increased or
decreased.
At some of these visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ heart health
using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
Some participants completed the study after the first year and did not continue in
the study.
