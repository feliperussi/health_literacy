Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat T2DM in people who also have
heart failure. Researchers already did studies that showed saxagliptin worked for
the people with T2DM who were in those studies. In this study, the researchers
wanted to find out more about how saxagliptin works in people with T2DM and
heart failure.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took saxagliptin, or another T2DM treatment called
sitagliptin, or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did saxagliptin have any effect on the participants’ heart function?
No. Overall, the researchers found that saxagliptin did not affect the
participants’ heart function.
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
Some of the participants had medical problems during the study that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These happened in:
• 2.7% of the participants who took saxagliptin. This was 3 out of 112
participants.
• 3.5% of the participants who took sitagliptin. This was 4 out of 115
participants.
• None of the participants who took the placebo.
The most common medical problem was low blood sugar. This happened in 2
participants who took sitagliptin. All the other adverse reactions only happened
in 1 person each.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
