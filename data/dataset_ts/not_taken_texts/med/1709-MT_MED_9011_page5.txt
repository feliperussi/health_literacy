Clinical Trial Results
In a 24-hour period of time, researchers found that:
• When participants got pramlintide and insulin, they had about
152.2 mg/dL of sugar in their blood.
• When participants got the placebo and insulin, they had about
173.8 mg/dL of sugar in their blood.
The figure below shows the average amount of sugar participants had in
their blood in a 24-hour period of time during this study. The larger dots on
the line are when researchers measured participants’ sugar levels, and meal
times are circled.
