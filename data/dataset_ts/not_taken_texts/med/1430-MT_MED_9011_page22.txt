What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in Group 3 of this study were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participants’ tumors?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if ceralasertib with olaparib help improve the health of people with
ES-SCLC.
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants in Group 3 of this study took ceralasertib with olaparib.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
In this study, treatment happened in 4 week periods called “cycles”.
The participants took ceralasertib and olaparib as tablets by mouth. The doses
were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
The participants took study treatment until they left the study, or the study doctors
thought the treatments were no longer helping them.
