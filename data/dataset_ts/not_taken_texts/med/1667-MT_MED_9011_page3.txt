Clinical Study Results
In this study, the infants got MEDI8897 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does
not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the
effects they see in the infants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each infant got. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the
results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
In this study, the infants got 1 dose of either MEDI8897 or a placebo as an injection. The
dose of MEDI8897 was measured in milligrams, also called mg.

What happened during the study?
Before the infants got any study treatment, the doctors:
• checked the overall health of the infants to make sure that they could join the study
• asked the caregivers about the medical history of the infants and what medications they
were getting
• took blood samples from the infants
During the study, the infants visited the study site at least 5 times.
Medical staff at the study site gave the infants the study drug that was randomly chosen
for them.
At these visits, the doctors:
• checked the health of the infants
• asked the caregivers about any illnesses, doctor visits, or hospitalizations the infant may
have had
• took blood samples from the infants (at 3 of the visits)
