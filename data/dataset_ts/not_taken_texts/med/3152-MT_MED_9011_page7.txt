What medical problems happened during this
study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care. There were no serious adverse
reactions in this study.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other
information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened
during this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about osimertinib by using
radio-labelled osimertinib to monitor how it acts in the brains of participants
with cancer cells from NSCLC that has spread to the brain.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with radio-labelled osimertinib are not planned.
