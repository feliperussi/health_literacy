Clinical Study Results
How much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood when they took it in
different forms?
The researchers found that the amounts of ticagrelor and the metabolite in the blood
were about the same for each of the treatments they compared.
To answer this question, the researchers compared:
• taking ticagrelor as a powder mixed with a liquid to the approved tablet
• taking ticagrelor as several children’s tablets to the approved tablet
This information helps the researchers learn if the amount of ticagrelor that gets into the
blood is different when taken in liquid form or the tablets meant for children compared to
the form meant for adults.
