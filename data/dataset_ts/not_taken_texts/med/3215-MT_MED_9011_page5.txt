Clinical Study Results
Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of these tests
and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these to be significant.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had. An adverse
event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of all the
adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be
related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study treatment. This section is a summary of all the adverse
events, whether they might be related to the study treatment or not. An adverse event is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs
hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
