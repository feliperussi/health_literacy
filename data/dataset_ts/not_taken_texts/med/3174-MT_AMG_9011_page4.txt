 41 participants (43%, or about 4 out of 10) were under 65 years old
In Part 2 of the study:
 371 participants (83%, or about 8 out of 10) were men and 77 participants (17%,
or about 2 out of 10) were women
 Participants ranged in age from 32 to 84 years
 239 participants (53%, or about half) were under 65 years old
5. Which medicines were studied?
What investigational medicines were studied?
 Participants received tablets containing the investigational medicine, omecamtiv
mecarbil or placebo. A placebo does not contain any medicine and helps
researchers compare the effects of a new medicine to taking no medicine. In
addition to omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo, participants could also receive other
medicines their doctor prescribed to treat their heart failure.
 Neither the participant nor the study doctor could choose whether they received
omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment
group by chance (“randomized”). This is like flipping a coin or drawing numbers
out of a hat.
 Neither the participant nor the study doctor or staff knew which investigational
medicine the participant was receiving during the study. This was done to make
sure the study results were not influenced in any way.
The figure below shows the investigational medicines the participants took in Part 1 of the
study.
Part 1 lasted 7 days
 Participants were enrolled into 1 of 2 dose groups (25 or 50 mg)
 Within each dose group, participants were randomized, to receive
1 of 3 different formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil, which had
slightly different ingredients, or the placebo.
 Participants took their assigned study treatment twice a day for 6
days and then once on day 7.
 Participants had a 3 in 4 (75%) chance of receiving omecamtiv
mecarbil and a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of receiving the placebo.
