The researchers also calculated the annual rate of asthma attacks for the
participants who had low levels of eosinophils in their blood.
The researchers found that the annual rate of asthma attacks was:
> 1.02 for the 309 participants who had low levels of eosinophils in their blood
and got tezepelumab
> 1.73 for the 309 participants who had low levels of eosinophils in their blood
and got the placebo
This was a reduction in annual rate of 41.0% for the participants who got
tezepelumab compared to those who got the placebo.
