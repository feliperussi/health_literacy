Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, the doctors:
• checked the overall health of the participants to make sure that they could join
the study
• took blood samples to check the participants’ blood potassium levels
• took urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
This was done at the same visit that the participants took their study treatment.
While the participants took study treatment, they visited the study site
1 time. At the beginning of this visit, they took SZC or the placebo. They also
received insulin and glucose infusions at the same time. Then, the participants took
SZC or the placebo again at 4 hours and 10 hours after taking the first dose.
The participants whose blood potassium stayed too high could get extra treatments.
When possible, these were given more than 4 hours after the first dose of SZC. SZC
was not given as one of these extra treatments.
This visit lasted about 24 hours. During this visit, the doctors checked the
participants’ blood potassium levels 9 times.
About 7 days after taking study treatment, the participants visited the study
site 1 more time. At this visit, the doctors checked the participants’ overall health. If
a participant could not get to the study site for this visit, the doctors telephoned the
participant to see how he or she was feeling.
