How has this study helped participants and researchers?
These results helped the researchers learn more about using durvalumab or durvalumab
in combination with tremelimumab in Chinese participants with advanced solid tumors.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with durvalumab and tremelimumab are planned.
