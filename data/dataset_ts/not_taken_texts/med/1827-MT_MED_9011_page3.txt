Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
All of the participants got MEDI1873 through a needle into a vein, also known as
an IV infusion. They got MEDI1873 every 2 weeks for 1 year. Some participants
may have continued getting MEDI1873 after 1 year, if the study doctors thought it
was helping their cancer.
There were 8 treatment groups in this study, and each group got a different dose of
MEDI1873. The doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
The participants in Groups 1 and 2 started the study first. After these participants
got at least 2 doses of MEDI1873, the study doctors looked at the results. Then,
the researchers decided whether to increase the dose of MEDI1873 in the next
group. Each group of participants got at least 2 doses of MEDI1873 before the
next group started the study.
The table below shows the 8 different treatment groups and doses in the study.
