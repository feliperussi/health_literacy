Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced head and neck cancers
that are associated with Human Papilloma Virus, also called “HPV”. These types of
cancer are also called “advanced HPV-associated” head and neck cancers. Before
a treatment can be approved for people to use, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body may not be able to control the growth of some
cells. These extra cells can form tumors. Over time, these tumors can spread to
different areas of the body and cause harm. The immune system has an important
role in destroying cells that have grown abnormally and could eventually become
cancer. Researchers are currently investigating how to help immune cells to
recognize and fight these tumors.
HPV is a very common virus that can sometimes cause abnormal growth in cells in
the mouth and throat. Most people with HPV do not have any symptoms, and the
immune system can often get rid of the virus after infection. However, if a person
is infected with a harmful type of HPV for many years, the infected cells can
become tumors.
The study drug, MEDI0457, is a new vaccine that targets a certain part of HPV.
In this study, MEDI0457 was given together with another study drug called
durvalumab. Durvalumab sticks to the outside of certain tumors to help the
immune system to find and destroy the cancer cells. Researchers want to find out
if giving MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab helps the immune system
recognize HPV-associated head and neck cancer cells.
In this study, researchers wanted to learn about the safety of MEDI0457 with
durvalumab and how it works in participants with advanced HPV-associated head
and neck cancers.
