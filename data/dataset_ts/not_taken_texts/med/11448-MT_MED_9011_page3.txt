What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did taking acalabrutinib as a capsule or as a tablet affect how much got into
the blood?
X Did the particle size of acalabrutinib affect how much got into the blood?
X Did the participants find the smell and taste of acalabrutinib tablets mixed
with water to be acceptable?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The researchers wanted to learn the answers to these questions before doing
other studies to learn if acalabrutinib could help people who have B-cell lymphoid
cancers.
What treatments did the participants take?
There were 2 Parts in this study. In Part 1, the participants took acalabrutinib as
a capsule by mouth or as a tablet by mouth. There were 4 different treatment
groups in each part. In some treatment groups, the participants did not eat for 10
or more hours before taking treatment.
All of the participants in Part 1 took Treatments 1 and 2. Then, they took either
Treatment 3 or 4. For those who took Treatment 4, they also took a proton-pump
inhibitor called rabeprazole as a tablet by mouth.
In Part 2, a different group of participants took acalabrutinib as a tablet or as a
liquid by mouth. All of the participants in this part took all 4 treatments.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
This study was a “crossover” study. This means that the participants took similar
treatments in a different order. A computer program was used to randomly choose
the order in which each participant took their study treatments. This helps make
sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
