At the beginning of the study, all of the participants were taking 1 of these
3 types of RAAS inhibitors:
• angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, called ACEis
• angiotensin receptor blockers, called ARBs
• angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, called ARNIs
Some participants were also taking lower than target doses of another type of
RAAS inhibitor, called an aldosterone receptor antagonist, or also known as an
MRA.
After the first week of taking study treatment, each participant’s dose of the
study drug and their doses of combined RAAS inhibitors were increased or
decreased as recommended by the doctors.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants took in this study.
There was 1 participant who did not take any treatment. So, the chart only
includes the 181 participants who took at least 1 dose of treatment.
