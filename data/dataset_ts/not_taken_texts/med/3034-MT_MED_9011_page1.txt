Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug studied: AZD9898
Study Title: A study in healthy volunteers and people with asthma
to evaluate different doses of AZD9898
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD9898.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the
study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in August 2017. It included 34 participants from the
United Kingdom.
The researchers planned to include 3 parts in the study. Parts 1 and 3 would include only healthy
participants. Part 2 would include people with asthma. But after researchers reviewed the results
from Part 1, they learned that the study did not have the results that were expected. Researchers
decided not to continue with Parts 2 and 3 of the study. This meant that only healthy participants
were included in this study.
The sponsor reviewed the information collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with asthma. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and
if it works. This includes testing in healthy volunteers as well as people with the condition being
studied.
Asthma is a condition that can cause swelling in the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs.
This swelling can make it difficult for people with asthma to breathe. They can also experience
wheezing, chest tightness and coughing.
