Clinical Study Results
This was a phase 1 study. In this type of study, the researchers want to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study. The researchers in this study
also wanted to learn how different combinations of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and
metformin act in the body of healthy people when the drugs are taken with and without
food. This information is important to know before other studies can be done to help
find out if different combinations of these drugs improve the health of people with
type 2 diabetes.
All 3 of the study drugs are already approved to treat type 2 diabetes. The researchers
wanted to compare different combinations of these drugs to combinations that are
already approved.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• How did different combinations of the study drugs act in the body?
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew
what the participants were taking.
There were 6 different treatments in the study. But, each participant only took 3 of the
treatments once.
All of the treatments had metformin combined with dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, or both.
One of the treatments had the approved form of saxagliptin. Another one of the
treatments was an approved form of a drug that had both dapagliflozin and metformin.
• 3 treatments had a low dose of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, or both
• 3 treatments had a high dose of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, or both
• All 6 treatments had the same dose of metformin, but in different forms
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatments each participant took
and the order in which they took the treatments. Researchers do this so that comparing
the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
