What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before
and after the participants took ceralasertib and acalabrutinib.
The doctors did physical exams and tested the participants’ blood and
urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check
the participants’ heart health. Overall, the researchers found that there were
some small changes in the results of these tests and measurements. But, the
researchers did not consider these changes to be meaningful.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
