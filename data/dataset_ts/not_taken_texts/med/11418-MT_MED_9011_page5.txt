The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements at later visits
throughout the study.
While the participants were taking study treatment, it was planned that
they would visit their study site 4 times. But, since the study was stopped early,
they had fewer visits. At each visit, the participants stayed overnight at their study
site for 5 days.
It was planned that there would be at least 2 weeks between each visit. This part
of the study was planned to last for about 8 weeks in total.
At these visits, the study doctors:
X gave the participants 1 dose of study treatment
X checked the participants’ lung health and measured the amount of air they
could breathe out
X asked the participants about their symptoms and taste
X monitored the participants’ cough
After the participants had finished taking study treatment, they visited
their study site for 1 last visit. This visit happened within about 1 week of their final
treatment. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
study results.
Because the study was stopped early, none of the participants took all of their
treatments. Each participant took only 1 of the 3 treatments that were planned.
