Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced small-cell lung cancer,
also called ES-SCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got either:
> durvalumab with chemotherapy
> durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy
> chemotherapy alone
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did durvalumab alone or together with tremelimumab, with
chemotherapy, help the participants live longer than chemotherapy alone?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab
with chemotherapy did live longer than those who got chemotherapy alone.
However, the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab with
chemotherapy did not live longer than those who got chemotherapy alone.
> Did the participants feel that durvalumab alone or together with
tremelimumab, with chemotherapy, affected their symptoms and quality
of life?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants in all treatment groups felt
that some specific symptoms got better after getting study treatment. The
participants who got durvalumab with chemotherapy had a longer time before
their quality of life got worse than the participants who got chemotherapy
alone. The participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab with
chemotherapy had a similar quality of life to those who got chemotherapy
alone.
