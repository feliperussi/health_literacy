Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if ticagrelor improves the health of people with sickle cell disease.
In this study, the researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the
study was 20 to 55 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants knew
what the participants were taking.
There were 4 ticagrelor treatments in this study. They all had the same amount of
ticagrelor in them. All of the participants who completed the study took all 4 treatments,
but in a different order. All of the ticagrelor treatments were taken by mouth:
1. Powdered ticagrelor mixed with a liquid
2. Several tablets of ticagrelor that are meant for children
3. Several tablets of ticagrelor that are meant for children, mixed with water
4. A tablet of ticagrelor that is already approved for people to take
Although some of the tablets were meant for children, only adults were in this study.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors checked the participants’ health, asked how
they were feeling, and asked what medicines they were taking. The doctors did this to
make sure the participants could take part in the study.
During the study, the participants took treatments for about 6 weeks. They visited
their study site up to 4 times. At each visit, they took one of the 4 forms of ticagrelor,
but in a different order. In between treatments, there was a “washout period” of 1 week.
During the washout periods, the participants were not allowed to take certain medicines.
This means that their bodies had processed all of the medicines in their blood, and the
medicines had “washed out” of their bodies.
