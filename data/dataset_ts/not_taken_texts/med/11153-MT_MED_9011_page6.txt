What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took cotadutide or a placebo through a needle
under the skin. This is also known as a “subcutaneous injection”.
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use
a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
taking. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants took so they
could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose if the participants took
cotadutide or the placebo. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible.
The doses of cotadutide increased about every 2 weeks. The doses were
measured in micrograms, also known as µg.
The chart below shows the treatments that the researchers planned to study.
50 participants 24 participants
• starting at 50 µg of cotadutide • placebo
and up to either 300 µg or 600 µg
• injections under the skin
of cotadutide in each dose
• injections under the skin
1 injection every day for 19 weeks
