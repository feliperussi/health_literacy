What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for AZD6615.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?
None of the participants in either treatment group had adverse reactions.
None of the participants in either treatment group stopped taking study treatment
due to adverse reactions.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about the safety of AZD6615 in healthy
participants.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD6615 are not planned.
