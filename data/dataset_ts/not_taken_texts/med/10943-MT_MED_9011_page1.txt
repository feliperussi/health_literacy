Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca
Treatment Studied: AZD4831
Study Purpose: This study was done to learn how AZD4831
works and about its safety in participants with
a type of heart failure called HFpEF
Protocol Number: D6580C00003
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD4831.
You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about AZD4831 to help people
who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, also called HFpEF. In people with HFpEF,
the heart can pump normally or nearly normally but becomes too stiff to fill properly. This means
that blood collects in the lungs and in the rest of the body.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of the study
with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of
your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
study doctor or staff at your study site.
