Clinical Study Results
Was there a difference in the amounts of MEDI0382 in the blood of participants
with kidney damage compared to the blood of healthy participants?
No. In general, the researchers found that the participants with kidney damage and the
healthy participants had similar amounts of MEDI0382 in their blood. The researchers
also found little difference in the amounts of MEDI0382 in the blood of the participants
who had different levels of kidney damage.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the average and highest amounts of
MEDI0382 in the blood 2 days after the participants got treatment. Then, the researchers
compared these amounts for Groups 2, 3, and 4 with the amounts for the healthy
participants. The researchers studied these amounts because they wanted to learn how
much MEDI0382 reaches the blood. These results could help future researchers decide
what drug amounts to give to patients based on their kidney health.
For the average amount of MEDI0382 in the blood, the researchers found that:
• Group 2 participants had about 1.0% less MEDI0382 in the blood compared to the
healthy participants.
• Group 3 participants had about 1.0% more MEDI0382 in the blood compared to the
healthy participants.
• Group 4 participants had about 9.0% more MEDI0382 in the blood compared to the
healthy participants.
The figure below shows these results.
