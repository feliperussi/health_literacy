How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn about the safety of ZS in a large number of
Japanese patients with high blood potassium.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with ZS are planned.
