How did AZD9977 affect the participants’ blood potassium levels?
Overall, the researchers found that AZD9977 increased the amount of potassium
in the participants’ blood by about the same amount as spironolactone did.
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of potassium
in the participants’ blood. The researchers compared the participants’ blood
potassium at the start of the study with their blood potassium after taking the
study treatment for 4 weeks. They calculated the difference as a percentage.
Then, they compared these results between the participants who took AZD9977
and those who took spironolactone.
