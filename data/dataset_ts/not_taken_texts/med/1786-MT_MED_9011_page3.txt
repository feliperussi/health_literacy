Clinical Trial RESULTS
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
researchers, or staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies
are done this way because knowing what treatment each participant is taking
can affect the results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly. In
this study, everyone took the study drug and a placebo.
Your study included participants with moderate to severe COPD who were 45 to
79 years old.
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to 6 weeks.
All 51 participants visited their study site 4 times in 4 weeks, and took either
Symbicort or the placebo during these visits. The visits were 1 week apart.
Participants did not stay overnight at the study site during these 4 visits.
The study had 2 groups. Participants in both groups took Symbicort and
placebo in 1 of 2 treatment cycles:
• Symbicort  Placebo  Symbicort  Placebo
• Placebo  Symbicort  Placebo  Symbicort
The order participants took Symbicort and the placebo was determined by
chance, like rolling dice.
One total dose of Symbicort for each participant contained 320 micrograms,
or µg, of budesonide and 9 µg of formoterol. A μg is a widely accepted
scientific unit of measurement.
