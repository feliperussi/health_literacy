Clinical Trial Results
Generally, the amount of MEDI6012 was too small to be measured in participants who
got Dose 5 of MEDI6012 through an injection. For all other treatment groups, researchers
found that:
• The average amounts of MEDI6012 in the blood were larger in participants who
got the higher doses of the study drug.
• The participants who got the higher doses of MEDI6012 had the highest amounts
of MEDI6012 in the blood.
• It took longer for MEDI6012 to reach its highest amount in the blood for
participants who got the higher doses of the study drug.
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem.
Researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study.
These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
A similar number of participants who got the MEDI6012 IV treatment and the MEDI6012
injection treatment had adverse events.
The table below shows how many participants in the study had medical problems. No
participants stopped taking the drug because of a medical problem.

How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or needs hospital care. In this study, no participants developed serious
medical problems, and no participants died.
