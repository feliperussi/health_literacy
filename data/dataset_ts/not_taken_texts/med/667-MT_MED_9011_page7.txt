A full list of the questions that researchers wanted to answer can be found on the
websites listed at the end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 270 participants who took olaparib and had their cancer measured
at the start of the study. So, the results below include only 270 of the 272
participants.
When the participants took olaparib, how many had a treatment
response?
To answer this question, the study doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors
using MRI or CT scans. To measure tumor growth, they used a set of rules called
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also known as “RECIST”. Then, the
researchers calculated how many of the participants had their tumors shrink partly
or completely. This is also known as a complete or partial response.
Overall, the researchers found that 37.4% of the participants had a treatment
response while taking olaparib. This was 101 out of 270 participants.
The number of participants who had a treatment response in the different groups
was as follows:
X 69.3% of participants in Group 1. This was 52 out of 75 participants.
X 64.0% of participants in Group 2. This was 16 out of 25 participants.
X 29.4% of participants in Group 3. This was 20 out of 68 participants.
X 10.1% of participants in Group 4. This was 9 out of 89 participants.
X 30.8% of participants in Group 5. This was 4 out of 13 participants.
