Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So
when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems
that participants have during the study. These medical problems are also called
“adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems in this study?
For the participants in Group 1, 12 of the 20 participants (60.0%) had medical
problems. Among the participants in Group 2, 16 of the 20 participants (80.0%)
developed had medical problems. The table below shows how many participants
in each treatment group developed medical problems.
