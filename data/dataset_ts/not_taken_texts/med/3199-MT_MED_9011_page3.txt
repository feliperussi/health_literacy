Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who had heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction, also called HFrEF. The participants in this
study had or were at risk of having high potassium levels in their blood. The
participants were 51 to 92 years old when they joined. All the participants were
taking less than the target dose of some heart failure medications called RAAS
inhibitors, also called renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors.
The study included 182 participants in Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to make sure people with heart failure
who have, or are likely to have, high blood potassium levels can take target
doses of RAAS inhibitors. The “target dose” is the dose of an RAAS inhibitor
that many doctors think will have the most benefit in treating that person’s heart
failure. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if SZC makes it easier for a
small number of participants with heart failure to be treated with target doses of
RAAS inhibitors. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as well as it
should. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and make the heart change
shape. It can also cause fluid to build up in the arms and legs. RAAS inhibitors
are a common treatment for heart failure, but they can increase the amount of
potassium in the blood. This can cause other heart problems.
Because of the possible increase in blood potassium levels, some people with
heart failure do not take RAAS inhibitors. Or, they take lower doses than the
target doses that are recommended to treat their heart failure.
