How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how different forms of AZD9977 act in
the blood of healthy participants and to find out if AZD9977 is safe to take.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD9977 are planned.
