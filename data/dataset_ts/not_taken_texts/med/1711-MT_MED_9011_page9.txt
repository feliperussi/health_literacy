Did AZD4076 affect the liver fat or the blood sugar of the participants?
To answer this question, the study doctors recorded the results of the participants’
tests and measurements that were done throughout the study. They measured the
amount of fat in the participants’ liver using MRI. They also measured the amount
of sugar in the participants’ blood.
Overall, they found that there were small changes in the results of these tests and
measurements during the study. But, the researchers did not consider these to be
meaningful.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
