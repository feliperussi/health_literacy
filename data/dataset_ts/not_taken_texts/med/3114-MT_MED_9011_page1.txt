Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, also called SZC. All of the participants helped
researchers learn more about SZC to help people with high levels of potassium in
their blood. This condition is also called hyperkalemia.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We
hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their important role in
medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
