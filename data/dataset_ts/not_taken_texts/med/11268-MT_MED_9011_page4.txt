What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants in this study took abediterol. They all took abediterol
through 2 different nebulizers or a dry powder inhaler. The doses of abediterol
were measured in micrograms, also known as μg.
The chart below shows the 4 different treatment groups that were planned.
Group Treatment taken
1 2.4 μg of abediterol through nebulizer 1
2 4.8 μg of abediterol through nebulizer 1
3 2.4 μg of abediterol through nebulizer 2
4 2.5 μg of abediterol through a dry powder inhaler
This study was “open-label”. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order of treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
In this study, it was planned that the participants would take abediterol each of
the 4 different ways one after the other. But, this did not happen because the
researchers ended the study early.
