Clinical trial results
The study had 3 groups, with 8 participants in each. Each participant was
in only 1 of the 3 groups. Participants in all 3 groups got either AZD8871
or the placebo through an inhaler. The different doses of the study drug
and placebo were given in micrograms, or μg. This is a widely accepted
scientific unit of measurement. Study doctors looked at the results of
the AZD8871 doses in each group before deciding what dose to give the
participants in the next group.
• Group 1: On Day 1, 6 participants got 300 μg of AZD8871
and 2 participants got the placebo. From Day 5 to Day 16,
all 8 participants then got the same dose of AZD8871 or
the placebo once daily.
• Group 2: On Day 1, 6 participants got 600 μg of AZD8871
and 2 participants got the placebo. From Day 5 to Day 16,
all 8 participants then got the same dose of AZD8871 or
the placebo once daily.
• Group 3: On Day 1, 6 participants got 900 μg of AZD8871
and 2 participants got the placebo. From Day 5 to Day 16,
all 8 participants then got the same dose of AZD8871 or
the placebo once daily.
It was determined by chance, like rolling dice, which treatment each
participant got.
During the study, doctors checked each participant’s blood pressure,
heart rate, and temperature. They also tested participants’ blood and
urine to check their health. Finally, study doctors checked participants’
hearts using an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Study doctors also asked
participants how they were feeling.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the
researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that
researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which
medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies
with AZD8871 are ongoing.
