Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study
results.
The study doctors were not able to use the results from 3 of the participants. So,
the results below include 39 out of 42 participants.
Did any of the participants have immune reactions to MEDI9090 within
the first 30 days of getting treatment?
To answer this question, the study doctors counted how many participants had
medical problems related to the infusion of the study drugs within the first 30 days
of getting treatment. These were called “infusion-related reactions”.
The study doctors found that none of the participants had any infusion-related
reactions within the first 30 days of getting treatment.
The study doctors also did blood tests to learn if any of the participants had
immune reactions by developing antibodies against MEDI9090 within the first 30
days of getting treatment. Antibodies are proteins that the body’s immune system
makes to protect against anything the immune system does not recognize as
part of the body. The study doctors used the proportion of participants who had
developed antibodies against MEDI9090 as a measurement of whether or not the
participants had an immune reaction against MEDI9090.
Because MEDI9090 is a combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, the study
doctors looked for antibodies against each of these study drugs individually.
