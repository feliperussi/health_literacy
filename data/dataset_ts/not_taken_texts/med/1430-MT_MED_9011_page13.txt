Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with ES-SCLC who had
received chemotherapy that was no longer helping their cancer. The participants in
Group 2 of this study were 48 to 78 years old when they joined.
Group 2 included 10 participants in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and Ukraine.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have ES-SCLC.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
For Group 2 of this study, the researchers wanted to find out how adavosertib with
carboplatin worked in a small number of participants with ES-SCLC. If the drugs
worked well, the researchers planned to do a similar study in a larger number of
participants. The participants in this study had already received chemotherapy that
was no longer helping their cancer. The researchers also wanted to find out what
medical problems the participants had during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. When cancer reaches the “extensive stage”, tumors can
spread to other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started.
Sometimes there are too many tumors, or they are too difficult to remove by
surgery. This is also called “advanced” cancer.
Certain proteins, which are substances in the body, can cause tumors to grow.
Adavosertib was designed to stop 1 of these proteins from letting tumors grow
and to cause tumor cells to die. The researchers thought that adavosertib might
also make tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy with carboplatin, which would
make them easier to treat.
For Group 2 of this study, the researchers wanted to find out how adavosertib and
carboplatin worked together in these participants.
