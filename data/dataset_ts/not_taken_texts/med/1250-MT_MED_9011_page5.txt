Clinical Study Results
After the participants got the last dose of study treatment, the doctors checked
their overall health. They took a blood sample and did an ECG.
At the end of the study, some participants joined another anifrolumab study right away.
This decision was made by the doctor, in discussion with the participant. It also depended
on if specific criteria were met. The rest of the participants stopped getting anifrolumab
and visited the study site 2 more times for follow up. At these visits, the doctors checked
their overall health. The figure below shows what happened during the study.
