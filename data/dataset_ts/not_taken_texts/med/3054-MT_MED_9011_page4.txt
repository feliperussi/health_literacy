What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did benralizumab reduce the estimated number of asthma attacks that the
participants would have experienced over 1 year?
X Did the participants feel that benralizumab helped their health-related quality
of life and helped them control their asthma symptoms?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if benralizumab helps improve the health of people with severe
asthma.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the study
drug are actually caused by the study drug.
The participants got benralizumab or the placebo through a needle under the
skin, also known as a “subcutaneous injection”. The participants got the first 3
doses of their injections once every 4 weeks. They got their final dose 8 weeks
later.
All of the participants also continued to take “standard of care” asthma treatments
that they were using before joining the study. “Standard of care” means the
treatment that the medical community thinks is the appropriate and widely
accepted treatment for a condition.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew whether each participant was getting
benralizumab or the placebo. Some studies are done this way because knowing
what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study.
When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the
participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
