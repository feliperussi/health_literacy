Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study
doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking. Some
studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking
can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out
which treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants took either AZD9567 and a placebo that looked like
prednisolone, or they took prednisolone and a placebo that looked like AZD9567. A
placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the
drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
AZD9567 and the placebo that looked like AZD9567 were taken as liquids by mouth.
Prednisolone and the placebo that looked like prednisolone were taken as pills by mouth.
The treatment doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg. The chart below
shows the treatment the participants took.
