Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The website listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Out of the 62 participants in the study, there were 2 participants who did not take
any study treatment. So, the results below include only the 60 participants who
took the study treatment.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
There were 20.0% of participants who had serious adverse reactions during this
study. This was 12 out of 60 participants.
The only serious adverse reactions that happened in more than 1 participant
were nausea and increased blood pressure.
None of the participants died due to serious adverse reactions during the study.
