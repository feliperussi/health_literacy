AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
