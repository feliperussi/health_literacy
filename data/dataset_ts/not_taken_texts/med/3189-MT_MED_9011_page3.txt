Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site 4 more times. They took
1 of the 4 inhaler treatments during each visit until they had taken all 4 treatments.
There was a “washout period” of about 2 weeks in between these visits. During this
time, the participants were not allowed to take certain medicines. This means that
their bodies had processed all of the medicines in their blood, and the medicines
had “washed out” of their bodies.
The participants took the same dose of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate each time, but in a different order. They also took each
treatment in a different order in an inhaler in these 4 ways:
• without charcoal, but with a spacer
• without charcoal or a spacer
• with both charcoal and a spacer
• with charcoal, but without a spacer
At the end of the study, the doctors called the participants about 1 week after
their last treatment dose and asked how they were feeling and what medicines
they were taking.
