How much AZD2014 got into the blood and saliva, and how much AZD2014 left
the body?
Researchers used blood and saliva samples to find out how much AZD2014 got into the
blood and saliva of participants.
Researchers measured the following:
• Average amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva
• Highest amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva
• Time it took for AZD2014 to reach its highest amount in the blood and saliva
• The amount of AZD2014 that left the body
Average amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva
Researchers measured the average amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva in nanogram
hours per millilitre of blood and saliva, or h•ng/mL. This is a way for researchers to measure
the amount of drugs in blood and saliva. The chart below shows the average amount of the
drug in the blood and saliva.
