with rheumatoid arthritis
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI4920. MedImmune, Ltd. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share
the results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in June 2016 and ended in September 2018. The study included 57
participants in Poland and the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have rheumatoid arthritis,
also called RA. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people who have RA, the immune system can attack the bodyâ€™s own tissues, joints,
and organs. This can lead to pain and swelling in the body. There are treatments that
help the symptoms of RA, but sometimes the symptoms come back or do not completely
go away.
The study drug, MEDI4920, is being developed to treat patients who have RA. In this
study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of MEDI4920 in participants
who have RA.
