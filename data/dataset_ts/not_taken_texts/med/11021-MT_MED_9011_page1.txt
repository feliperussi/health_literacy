Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs
budesonide and albuterol sulfate. AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks
it is important to share the results. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2019 and ended in September 2019. It included 67
participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have asthma. Before
a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra
mucus. This can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty
breathing.
