Clinical Trial RESULTS
How did anifrolumab act in the body?
Researchers wanted to see how the study drug acted in the body. They wanted
to know:
• The average amount of anifrolumab in the blood
• The highest amount of anifrolumab in the blood
• How long it took for anifrolumab to reach its highest amount in the blood
Average amount of anifrolumab in the blood
Researchers measured the average amount of anifrolumab in participants’
blood in micrograms each day per milliliter of blood, or µg•day/mL. This is
a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.
The figure below shows this amount for the 3 anifrolumab treatment groups.
