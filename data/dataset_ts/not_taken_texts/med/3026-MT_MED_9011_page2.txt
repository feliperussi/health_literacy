Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, also called COPD. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COPD is a long-term condition caused by damage to and narrowing of the airways.
COPD can lead to symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and phlegm.
There are treatments that help people manage their COPD symptoms. But, these
treatments may not work for some people. They may also cause medical problems
for some people.
COPD symptoms can happen when a protein in the body causes swelling in
the airways. The study treatment, MEDI3506, was designed to stop swelling
by blocking this protein from sending signals to the body. MEDI3506 is being
developed to treat COPD, asthma, and eczema. Asthma is a condition that causes
the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. This can cause symptoms
such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Eczema is a condition in
which the skin becomes itchy and red.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of different doses
and dosing schedules of MEDI3506. They wanted to learn how MEDI3506 affects
participants who have mild allergies, participants who have COPD, and healthy
Japanese participants. This information may help researchers determine what
doses of MEDI3506 to use with future study participants, and if ethnicity plays a
role in the effects of MEDI3506.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if MEDI3506 improves the health of people who have COPD,
asthma, or eczema.
