Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew what the
participant was taking.
All the participants got one very small dose of AZD1390. AZD1390 was specially prepared to give
off a small amount of radiation so that it could be measured in the body for up to 2 hours after it
was given. The participants got AZD1390 through a needle placed into a vein. This is called an
intravenous infusion, also known as an IV.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the researchers:
• checked the participants’ health to make sure they could join the study
• asked participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines
they were taking
• gave each participant a test called magnetic resonance imaging, also called an MRI, to
make sure that their brain was healthy before joining the study
During the study, the participants visited their study site once. During this visit:
• The participants got 1 dose of AZD1390 through an IV.
• The researchers took pictures of each participant’s brain using positron emission
tomography, also called a PET scan. By using the PET scan, doctors could see if AZD1390
entered the participant’s brain.
• After getting AZD1390 and during the PET scan, the researchers took blood samples.
Blood samples were taken from a needle placed in an artery in the opposite arm of where
AZD 1390 was given in a vein.
At the end of the study, a follow-up phone call was done about 7 days after the participant got
the treatment and the PET scan. This was done to ask each participant about their health and how
they were feeling.
