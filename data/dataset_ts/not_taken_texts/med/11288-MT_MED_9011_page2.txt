Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat tumors. Before a drug can be approved
for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it
works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells. The
extra cells can form tumors, which can start in any part of the body.
The study drug, savolitinib, is being developed as a treatment for tumors. Researchers
think that savolitinib may also slow down the removal of certain substances from the
body, such as the drug midazolam. Midazolam is a drug prescribed by doctors to relax
people before minor surgery.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how midazolam acts in the body when
taken with savolitinib. They wanted to learn if savolitinib slows down the removal of
midazolam from the body. Also, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had
any medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did midazolam act in the body when taken with savolitinib?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know. Other studies are being done to
find out if savolitinib helps improve the health of people who have tumors.
