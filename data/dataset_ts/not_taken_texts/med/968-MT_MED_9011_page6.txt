Clinical Study Results
How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or needs hospitalization.
In this study:
• 39 out of 313 participants (12.5%) who took dapagliflozin had serious medical
problems.
• 22 out of 312 participants (7.1%) who took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin had serious
medical problems.
• 35 out of 312 participants (11.2%) who took glimepiride had serious medical

The only serious medical problem that researchers thought was related to the study
drugs was a urinary tract infection, which happened in 1 participant in the dapagliflozin
group. No participants died during the study.
The table below shows the most common serious medical problems that occurred in at
