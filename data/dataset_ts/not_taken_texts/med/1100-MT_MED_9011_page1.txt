Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs
AZD2014, also called vistusertib, taken with palbociclib and fulvestrant. Together, they are
known as “the study drugs”. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about the
study drugs to help people with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps the participants
understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
Participants were in the study for up to 19 months. The study started in January 2016
and stopped collecting data at the end of March 2018. Some participants have continued
receiving treatment within the study.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study stopped collecting results and
created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The researchers planned to include up to 259 participants in the study. This study included
54 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States.
