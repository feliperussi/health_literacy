Clinical Study Results
How did AS MDI affect participants’ lungs?
The researchers compared how much air participants could breathe out before and
after taking AS MDI or Proventil.
Overall, the researchers found that the amount of air that participants could breathe out
was similar when participants took AS MDI compared with Proventil. The differences
seen between the two treatments were too small for the researchers to know if AS MDI
affected participants’ lungs differently to Proventil.
Researchers measured the amount of air participants exhaled at the beginning of the
study and compared that to the amount of air exhaled after taking either AS MDI or
Proventil. The volume of air breathed out was measured in milliliters, or mL for short.
30 minutes after taking each AS MDI dose, participants taking:
• 90 µg of AS MDI exhaled 421 mL more air.
• 180 µg of AS MDI exhaled 548 mL more air.
• 360 µg of AS MDI exhaled 619 mL more air.
• 720 µg of AS MDI exhaled 659 mL more air.
• 1440 µg of AS MDI exhaled 721 mL more air.
30 minutes after taking each Proventil dose, participants taking:
• 90 µg of Proventil exhaled 488 mL more air.
• 180 µg of Proventil exhaled 586 mL more air.
• 360 µg of Proventil exhaled 647 mL more air.
• 720 µg of Proventil exhaled 690 mL more air.
• 1440 µg of Proventil exhaled 805 mL more air.
