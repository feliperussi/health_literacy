Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ body weight?
Yes. The researchers found that the participants who were given MEDI0382
in Part 2 had a larger percent decrease in their body weight compared to the
participants who were given the placebo.
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ calorie intake?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who were given
MEDI0382 in Part 2 had a larger decrease in their calorie intake compared to the
participants who were given the placebo.
• Did MEDI0382 affect how many calories the participants burned off?
No. In Part 2 overall, the researchers found that there were differences in the
number of calories burned between the MEDI0382 group and the placebo group.
But, these differences were too small for the researchers to consider them to be
meaningful.
• What medical problems happened during the study?
There were 76.0% of participants who had medical problems during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. The most
common medical problem was nausea.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
