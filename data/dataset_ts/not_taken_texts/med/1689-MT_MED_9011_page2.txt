Clinical Study Results
Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat bacterial pneumonia. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got MEDI3902, or a placebo that looked like
MEDI3902. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI3902 affect the number of participants who developed bacterial
pneumonia?
No. Overall, the researchers found that MEDI3902 did not affect the number of
participants who developed bacterial pneumonia.
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
There were 98.0% of participants who got MEDI3902 who had adverse events
during the study.
There were 97.6% of participants who got the placebo who had adverse events
during the study.
The most common of these adverse events was low blood pressure.
• What medical problems happened during this study?
There were 3.0% of participants who got MEDI3902 who had medical problems
during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study
treatment.
There were 1.2% of participants who got the placebo who had medical
problems during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the
study treatment.
The most common of these medical problems was a skin reaction at the
infusion site. An infusion is when a treatment is given through a needle into a
vein over a period of time.
