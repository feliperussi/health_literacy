Did AZD9567 help the participants manage their RA symptoms?
To answer this question, the researchers studied the change in the severity of the
participants’ RA. They did this by looking at the participants’ test and survey results before
and after they took study treatment. Then, the researchers compared the results of the
participants who took AZD9567 with the results of the participants who took prednisolone.
