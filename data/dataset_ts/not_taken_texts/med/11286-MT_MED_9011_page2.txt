Who took part in the study?
The participants in this study were healthy men who were 25 to 55 years old when
they joined.
The study included 12 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease, also
called CAD. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
CAD is a condition that happens when the heart arteries become narrow or
blocked. This can cause heart attack, stroke, and other medical problems.
CAD can happen when certain proteins in the body cause swelling in the heart
arteries. The study drug, AZD5718, was developed to stop this swelling by
blocking these proteins from sending signals to the body.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how different forms of AZD5718
acted in the participantsâ€™ blood. They also wanted to find out if the participants
had any medical problems during this study.
This information may help researchers decide which forms and doses of AZD5718
to give to participants in future studies.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> How did the different forms of AZD5718 act in the blood?
> What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD5718 improves the health of people who have CAD.
