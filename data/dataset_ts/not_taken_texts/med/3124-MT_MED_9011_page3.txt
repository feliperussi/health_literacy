In these parts of the study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety
of different doses and formulations of MEDI7219. They wanted to study these
when taken by mouth or given as an IV infusion in healthy participants.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
