Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study
results.
Some of the participants left the study before the researchers could measure and
compare the study results. These participants left because of a medical problem
or because they did not follow the study guidelines. So, the below results are for
only some of the 91 participants. The number of participants included for each
measurement are presented below.
Did budesonide and albuterol sulfate act differently in the body when
taken together?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there was little difference in how the drugs
acted in the body when taken together compared to when taken alone.
To answer this question, the doctors measured the amount of budesonide
and albuterol sulfate in the blood at different times for the first 24 hours after
participants took their treatment.
The researchers studied 3 different measurements:
• The amount of the drugs in the blood during the 24 hours after treatment. This
was measured in picogram hours per milliliter, also called pg*h/mL.
• The amount of the drugs in the blood until the amounts became too low for the
researchers to measure. This was measured in pg*h/mL.
• The highest amount of the drugs in the blood during the 24 hours after
treatment. This was measured in picograms per milliliter, also called pg/mL.
Overall, the researchers found there was little difference in these measurements
for the 3 treatments throughout the study. The results of these measurements are
listed below.
