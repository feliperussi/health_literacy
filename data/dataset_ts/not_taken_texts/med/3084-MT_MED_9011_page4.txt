Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the participants visited their study site 2 times over the course of 4 weeks.
During this time, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study.
The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• checked the participants’ blood sugar levels
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they
were taking
During the first 2 weeks, the participants continued taking metformin and other medicines.
During the next 2 weeks, the participants continued taking metformin but stopped taking certain
medicines. This was done so that the participants could continue managing their type 2 diabetes
without affecting the study results.
During the study, the participants visited their study site about 16 times over the course of
about 12 months. During the first 3 months of this time period, the participants visited their study
site 6 times. At each visit, they got MEDI0382, liraglutide, or the placebo 1 time.
All of the participants who got MEDI0382 started at a dose of 100 μg. Once the researchers
carefully studied the results, they increased the MEDI0382 dose for some of the participants.
There were 3 different doses of MEDI0382:
• 100 participants got 100 μg of MEDI0382 each day
• 256 participants got 200 μg of MEDI0382 each day
• 256 participants got 300 μg of MEDI0382 each day
The other participants got either liraglutide or the placebo:
• 110 participants got 1.8 mg of liraglutide each day
• 112 participants got the placebo each day
After the first 3 months, the researchers carefully studied the results. They checked the participants’
health and blood sugar levels to make sure they could continue the study. Then, for about 9 months,
the participants who were getting MEDI0382 continued taking their same dose of MEDI0382. They
visited their study site up to 10 times.
