Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs durvalumab
and tremelimumab, and to their families. All of the participants and their families helped
researchers learn more about using these study drugs to help people who have non-small-cell
lung cancer.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with the participants, their families, and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants and
their families understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you or a family member participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
