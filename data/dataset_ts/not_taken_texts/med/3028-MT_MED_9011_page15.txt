The table below shows the adverse reactions that happened in 15.0% or more
participants in any group during the study. There were other adverse reactions,
but these happened in fewer participants.

How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped the researchers learn that durvalumab with chemotherapy
helped participants with ES-SCLC live longer without lowering their quality of
life. The researchers learned that adding tremelimumab as well did not help the
participants. This study also helped the researchers understand about the safety of
these treatments.
The results of this study were used to seek approval for using durvalumab with
chemotherapy in people who have ES-SCLC.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with durvalumab alone or together with tremelimumab in
ES-SCLC and other types of cancer are ongoing.
