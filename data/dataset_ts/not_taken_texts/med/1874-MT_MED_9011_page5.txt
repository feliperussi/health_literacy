Clinical Trial Results
Did the COPD symptoms of participants improve after taking
AZD8871?
The researchers also wanted to find out if AZD8871 helped improve COPD
symptoms in participants. So, they gave the participants a survey that asked them
to grade how severe their COPD symptoms were at different times during the study.
A decrease in score meant that their COPD symptoms had improved.
On average, the participants taking:
• 100 μg of AZD8871 had a score decrease that was 0.46 points lower than
when they took the placebo
• 600 μg of AZD8871 had a score decrease that was 1.16 points lower than
when they took the placebo
How did AZD8871 act in the body?
The researchers also wanted to find out how much AZD8871 entered the body
of participants and how long it stayed there. So, they took blood samples from
the participants at different times during the study and measured the amounts
of AZD8871 in the blood.
After each 14-day treatment period, the researchers generally found that:
• The average amount of AZD8871 in the blood was greatest when the
participants took the higher dose of AZD8871
• The highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood was also greatest when the
participants took the higher dose of AZD8871
• It took a similar amount of time for both AZD8871 doses to reach their
highest amount in the blood
