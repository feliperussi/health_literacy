The most common serious adverse events were:
X low number of a type of white blood cell called neutrophils
X a fever and low number of neutrophils happening at same time
X low blood pressure
X difficulty breathing
The most common adverse events were:
X fatigue
X nausea
X low number of neutrophils
X extremely low number of neutrophils
X anemia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells in the blood
X diarrhea
The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities the
participants had during the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is an adverse event that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant’s dose
of study treatment. It can also cause the participant to stop their current dose of
study treatment. A dose-limiting toxicity is also known as a DLT.
There were 6.9% of participants who had a DLT. This was 5 out of 72 participants.
All of the participants who had a DLT got a high dose of AZD2811.
What medical problems happened during
this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the study drug.
