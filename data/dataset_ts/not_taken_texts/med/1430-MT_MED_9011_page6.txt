What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from Group 1 of this study. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did the study treatments shrink the participants’ tumors?
Some of the participants in Group 1 had tumors that shrank after they got
durvalumab and tremelimumab. But, the overall number of participants whose
tumors shrank was small.
To answer this question, the study doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors
using CT or MRI scans. The study doctors measured the size of the participants’
tumors before they took study treatment and throughout the study. The doctors
then used a set of rules to calculate how much the tumors shrank. These rules are
called Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST.
If a participant’s tumor shrank by at least a third of its size, the participant was
called a ”responder”. Participants whose tumors did not shrink or shrunk by less
than a third of their size were considered “non-responders”. The researchers then
calculated the percentage of responders.
In Group 1, 7.3% of the participants were responders. This was 3 out of
41 participants. The researchers decided that this number was too small for them
to do a further study in a larger number of participants.
