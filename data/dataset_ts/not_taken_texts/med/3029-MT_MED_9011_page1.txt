Study Title: A study to learn how sodium zirconium cyclosilicate affects
potassium levels in the blood
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the
study drug sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, also called ZS. You and all of the
participants helped researchers learn more about ZS to help people with high
potassium levels in their blood.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
We hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their important
role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 9 days. But, the entire study took
about 9 months to finish.
The study started in June 2017 and ended in February 2018. The study included
103 participants in Japan.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
