Clinical Study Results
The doses of AZD7594 were measured in micrograms, also known as μg.
The participants took 1 puff of their inhaler once a day. There were 6 different
treatment groups in this part. The table below shows the treatments that were
planned in the double-blind part.
There was also an “open-label” part of the study. This means the participants,
researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was
taking. In this part of the study, 112 participants took an ICS asthma treatment
called fluticasone furoate, also called FF. The participants took 1 puff of their FF
inhaler once a day.
The table below shows the treatments that were planned in the study.
Group Treatment
Group 1 (111 participants) 50 µg of AZD7594
Group 2 (112 participants) 90 µg of AZD7594
Group 3 (111 participants) 180 µg of AZD7594
Group 4 (113 participants) 360 µg of AZD7594
Group 5 (134 participants) 720 µg of AZD7594
Group 6 (113 participants) Placebo
Group 7 (112 participants) 100 µg of FF
If the participants had asthma symptoms at any time during the study, they could
also take an asthma treatment called salbutamol/albuterol, also called SABA.
