Clinical Trial RESULTS
During the study, 27 participants were assigned to one of 3 treatment groups. Participants
in each of the 3 groups had a 7 out of 9 chance of getting AZD7594 and a 2 out of 9 chance
of getting the placebo. The 3 treatments are listed below:
• 200 micrograms (µg) AZD7594 (1 puff) or placebo
• 400 µg AZD7594 (1 puff) or placebo
• 1600 µg AZD7594 (4 puffs of a 400-µg inhaler) or placebo
Participants took the study drug once on Day 1 and then did not take the study drug on
Days 2, 3, or 4. Starting on Day 5, participants took the study drug once a day until Day
16, which was a 12-day period. Researchers wanted there to be a few days in between
treatments so that they could observe the effects of each dose and not the effects of
multiple doses. The figure below shows how the study was done.
Single-Blind Study: 27 Participants
7 participants took 6 participants took
AZD7594 200 µg a placebo
7 participants took 7 participants took
AZD7594 400 µg AZD7594 1600 µg
Once-a-day treatment for 12 days
During the study, researchers did blood and urine tests and physical exams. They also
trained participants on how to correctly use the inhalers. Researchers also checked your
heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Participants had a final follow-up visit around
9 days after leaving the study center to make sure they were still healthy.
