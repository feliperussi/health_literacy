Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. Before a drug
can be approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab and tremelimumab work
in a small number of participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer. They also wanted to
find out if participants had any medical problems during the study.
The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, are being developed to treat pancreatic
cancer. Researchers wanted to learn how these drugs affect participants with metastatic
pancreatic cancer when durvalumab is given alone or when the 2 drugs are given
together. These drugs are both used to treat cancer, but in different ways.
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did durvalumab help participants’ tumors shrink or disappear when the drug was
given either alone or given together with tremelimumab?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women
with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The participants in this study were 37 to 81 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means that the researchers and the participant knew
what study drugs the participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
