Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
This study had 2 parts, Part A and Part B. In each part, the participants got
either MEDI0382 or a placebo. The diagram below shows how the study was
done. Part B of the study happened after participants in Part A had received the
100 µg dose of MEDI0382. The study was designed to have 4 groups in Part
A, but the researchers decided to not recruit the last group. Part B only had 1
group of participants. This group got the 100 µg dose because the researchers
did not expect there to be any meaningful differences in study results between
participants of Japanese or Chinese descent. The researchers thought that only
1 treatment group would be enough to check this.
