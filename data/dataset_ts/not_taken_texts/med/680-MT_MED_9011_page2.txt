Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer, also called mCRPC. Before a drug can be approved for people to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either olaparib, enzalutamide, or
abiraterone acetate.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did olaparib help the participants live longer with their cancer before it
got worse?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took olaparib lived
longer with their cancer before it got worse compared with those who took
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate.
> Did olaparib help the participants’ pain and health-related quality of life?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that olaparib helped the participants’ pain
and health-related quality of life compared with enzalutamide or abiraterone
acetate.
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 69.2% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
The most common medical problem was anemia. More information about the
medical problems in this study can be found later in this summary.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
