Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if MEDI3726 helps improve the health of people with mCRPC.
What treatments did the participants take?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting.
All of the participants in this study got MEDI3726 through a needle into a vein, also known as an
IV infusion. They got an IV infusion once every 3 weeks until they had medical problems, their
disease got worse, or the study doctors decided they should stop.
There were 7 different dose groups of MEDI3726. Each dose group started the study one
after the other at the next highest dose. At the beginning of the study, the first dose group of
participants started getting the lowest dose of MEDI3726. The researchers looked at the results
for these participants. Then, they decided whether to increase the dose of MEDI3726 in the next
dose group of participants.
The doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of a participant’s body weight, also known
as mg/kg. Each participant stayed in the same dose group throughout the study.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers studied.
