Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking. In this study, all of the participants took
AZD9977 and itraconazole capsules by mouth. The doses were measured in
milligrams, also called mg. This study happened in 2 parts during 9 days.
In Part 1:
• On Day 1, all of the participants took 100 mg of AZD9977.
• On Days 2 and 3, the participants did not take any study treatment.
In Part 2:
• On Days 4, 5, 6, and 8, the participants took 200 mg of itraconazole.
• On Day 7, the participants took 1 dose each of 200 mg of itraconazole and
100 mg of AZD9977.
The participants took each of the study treatments after they had eaten breakfast.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, the doctors checked their
overall health to make sure that they could join the study. This happened up to
28 days before the participants took the first treatment. The doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked the participants’ overall health
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
The doctors also checked the participants’ health and took blood and urine
samples while the participants were taking treatment, and after their last treatment.
While the participants were taking treatment, they stayed at the study site
for 9 days.
About 5 to 7 days after the last treatment, the participants visited the study
site 1 time.
