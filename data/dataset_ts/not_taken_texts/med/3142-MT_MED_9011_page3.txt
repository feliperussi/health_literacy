Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This study had 3 parts: Part A, Part B, and Part C. Each participant could only be in
1 part of the study.
Part A and Part C were “single-blind”. This means the researchers knew what
the participants were taking during these parts, but the participants did not. These
parts were also the “dose escalation” parts of the study. This means that the first
group of participants in each part started out by getting a low dose of AZD8154.
The study doctors carefully looked at the results from these participants, then
decided whether to increase the dose in the next group of participants.
Part B of the study was “open-label”. This means the researchers and the
participants knew which treatment the participants were taking during this part.
In Part A, the participants took 1 dose of either AZD8154 or a placebo through
an inhaler. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Part B started after Part A. In Part B, the participants took AZD8154 through an
inhaler or got it through a needle into their vein, also called an IV.
Part C started after Part B. In Part C, the participants took several doses of either
AZD8154 or a placebo through an inhaler.
All of the AZD8154 doses in this study were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took during Part A and Part C. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible.
