Clinical Study Results
The researchers also gave the participants surveys throughout the study asking them
to rate their overall pain and their pain from RA. After the 2-week treatment period, the
participants who took AZD9567 and the participants who took prednisolone reported a
decrease in their overall pain and their pain from RA. The researchers considered this
decrease to be similar for both groups.
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the
available data for the treatments.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
