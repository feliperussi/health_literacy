If the results were similar, this meant that the new apps helped measure the
participants’ well-being and asthma symptoms as much as the existing
methods did.
Because the study ended early, the researchers could not draw any conclusions
from the results.
What medical problems happened during
this study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study treatments are called “adverse
reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study treatments or devices. A lot of research is needed to know whether a
treatment or device causes an adverse reaction.
This study was not designed to collect information on adverse reactions that might
be related to benralizumab. It was designed to collect information on adverse
reactions that might be related to the use of the new apps. But, these adverse
reactions are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of
participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about using 3 new smartphone health
apps to detect early changes in the well-being of participants with severe asthma
who have recently started treatment with benralizumab.
This summary only shows information from this 1 study. Other studies may provide
new information.
No further clinical studies with these 3 apps were planned at the time this
summary was written.
