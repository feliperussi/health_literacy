SZC is currently available as a treatment for high blood potassium levels. SZC works
by trapping potassium in the gut and stopping it from getting into the blood. In
this study, the researchers wanted to find out if SZC could help the participants
take their target doses of RAAS inhibitors without raising blood potassium levels.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did SZC affect how many participants could take RAAS inhibitors without
having blood potassium levels that were too high?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if SZC helps improve the health of people with heart failure.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took either SZC or a placebo by mouth. A
placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use
a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was planned as a “double-blind” study. This means none of the
participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment
each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as
possible.
The participants took SZC or the placebo as a powder mixed with water. The
doses of SZC were measured in grams, also called g. The doses of SZC and the
placebo that each participant took at any given time during the study depended
on their blood potassium levels, kidney health, blood pressure, and on what the
doctors thought was safest for the participants.
