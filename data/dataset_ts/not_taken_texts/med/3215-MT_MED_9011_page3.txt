What happened during the study?
The study started in August 2018 and ended in August 2019.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 2 times. At these
visits, the study doctors checked the health of the participants to make sure they could join the
study. This part of the study lasted up to 5 weeks. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems
they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
At these visits, the study doctors showed the participants how to give themselves injections using
a saltwater injection, also called saline. The participants met with a dietician who gave them diet
and exercise advice.
The participants in Group 1 also started wearing a device to measure their blood sugar, called a
continuous glucose monitoring device. This is known as a CGM device.
