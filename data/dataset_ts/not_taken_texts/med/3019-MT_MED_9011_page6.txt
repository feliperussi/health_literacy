Clinical Study Results
The researchers also calculated the overall difference in UACR decrease between the
treatments using the least square mean calculation. They found that the UACR decrease
was 39.4% lower in the participants who took RDEA3170 and febuxostat compared to the
participants who took the placebos.
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
Usually the results from several trials are used to determine if a drug causes a specific
adverse reaction. At this stage, it is not known if these adverse reactions may be caused
by the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
