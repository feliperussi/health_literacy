ASD
The participants completed the ASD twice a day. The ASD asks about 5 main
asthma symptoms in the morning and 5 main asthma symptoms at night. The
participants received scores from 0 to 4 for each main symptom, based on their
responses. A low score on the ASD meant that the participant’s asthma symptoms
were minor. A high score meant that the participant’s asthma symptoms were
severe.
The researchers calculated the average ASD scores before treatment to after
48 weeks of treatment. They compared the results for the participants who
got tezepelumab to those who got the placebo. The difference between the
groups was too small for the researchers to know if tezepelumab had helped the
participants’ asthma symptoms.
Nighttime awakenings
The participants kept a record of how often they were awoken by their asthma
symptoms and required additional medication each week. The researchers
calculated the average number of nights that participants were woken up by
their asthma symptoms before treatment to after 48 weeks of treatment. They
compared the results for the participants who got tezepelumab to those who got
the placebo. The difference between the groups was too small for the researchers
to know if tezepelumab had helped control nighttime awakenings.
