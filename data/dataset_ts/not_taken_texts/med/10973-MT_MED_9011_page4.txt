What happened during the study?
The study started in December 2018 and ended in July 2019.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. This happened about 4 weeks before the participants got MEDI7242. At this
visit, the study doctors made sure that the participants could join the study. The
study doctors:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
> did a special type of heart X-ray, called a MUGA scan
> took blood and urine samples
> did a procedure called a biopsy to take a sample of the participants’ tumors, if
needed
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were getting study treatment in Part 1, they
visited their study site up to about 7 times during the first 6 weeks. After that, they
visited the study site once every 3 weeks until they left the study. At these visits,
they got their IV infusions of MEDI7247.
After the participants got their last study treatment, they visited their
study site 3 times over the course of about 3 months. At these visits, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants.
