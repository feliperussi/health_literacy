Clinical Study Results
In people with type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin. Insulin is made
by the pancreas and controls the levels of sugar in the blood. If a person’s blood sugar
levels are too high or too low, he or she can develop several medical problems. One of
the most common medical problems is damage to the kidneys.
MEDI0382 may be able to help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes,
which may be able to improve their health. But since many type 2 diabetes patients
already have kidney damage, the researchers in this study wanted to learn if and how
MEDI0382 affects the kidneys.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Was there a difference in the amounts of MEDI0382 in the blood of participants with
kidney damage compared to the blood of healthy participants?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of healthy men and
women, as well as men and women with kidney damage. The participants in this study
were between 44 to 82 years old at the start of the study.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were given.
All of the participants in the study got MEDI0382.
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• checked the blood sugar levels of the participants
• checked the kidney health of the participants
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
