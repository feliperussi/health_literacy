Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

How many participants had DLTs after getting adavosertib and
olaparib?
To help answer this question, the researchers counted the number of dose limiting
toxicities the participants had during Part A of the study.
Counting the number of DLTs helps researchers determine the safety of different
doses of a treatment. This helps them find the highest dose that the participants
can take. The researchers in this study wanted to determine what dose to give
participants in future studies using adavosertib and olaparib together.
The researchers did not count the number of DLTs in Part B of the study, since the
dose did not change during that part.
In Part A, 11.8% of the participants had a DLT. This was 14 out of 119 participants.
Some participants had more than 1 DLT.
