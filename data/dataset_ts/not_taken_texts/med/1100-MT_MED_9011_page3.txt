Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “dose finding” study. This means that the first group of participants started out
on a specific dose of study drugs. The doctors carefully looked at the results for these
participants. Then, the researchers decided whether to increase or decrease the dose in
the next group of participants. Researchers use dose finding studies to learn about the
safety of a specific dose before participants are given a different dose.
This was also an “open-label” study. This meant that the participants, the doctors, the
study staff, and the researchers knew what doses the participants took. In this study, the
participants took AZD2014, palbociclib, and fulvestrant.
Doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg. AZD2014 and palbociclib were
tablets that the participants took by mouth. Fulvestrant was given through a needle into
the muscle, also called an injection. The participants got their treatment during 28-day
time periods called “cycles”.
The researchers planned to have 3 parts to the study, called Part A, Part B, and Part C. But,
they decided to change the design during the second part due to a decision by AstraZeneca
AB to stop the development of AZD2014. So, only the results from Parts A and B are
included in this summary. Each participant was only in Part A or Part B of the study, not both
parts.
There were 7 treatment groups in total. In Part A, the researchers studied Group 1
through Group 6. In Part B, the researchers studied Group 7. The groups are presented
in the order in which they happened during the study.
