How many participants had adverse events?
This section is a summary of medical problems called “adverse events” that
participants had during the study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom of
a medical problem that participants have. Adverse events are different from
adverse reactions because they include any medical problem that happens
during the study whether the doctor thought the medical problem was caused by
the drug or not.
An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
