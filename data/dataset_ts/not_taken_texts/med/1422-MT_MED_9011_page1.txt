Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs
durvalumab, also called MEDI4736, and AZD5069. Also, thank you to the families
of the participants. All of the participants and their families helped researchers learn
more about durvalumab combined with other treatments in order to help people with
metastatic pancreatic cancer.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants, their families, and the public. An independent, non-
profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
We hope it helps the participants and their families understand their important role in
medical research.
If you or a family member participated in the study and have questions about the
results, please speak with the doctor or staff at the study site.
