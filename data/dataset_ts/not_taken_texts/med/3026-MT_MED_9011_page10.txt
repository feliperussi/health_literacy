Clinical Study Results
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the adverse events the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These adverse events are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for the treatments.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
