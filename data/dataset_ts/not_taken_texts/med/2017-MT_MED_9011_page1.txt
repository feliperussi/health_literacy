Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug MEDI3726.
MedImmune LLC sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the study
doctor or staff at your study site.
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men with a type of prostate cancer called metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer. The participants in this study were 54 to 81 years old when
they joined.
The study included 33 participants in Switzerland, the UK, and the USA.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat prostate cancer in people who have already
tried other treatments, but whose disease has still gotten worse. Before a drug can be approved
for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, also known as mCRPC, is a type of prostate
cancer that gets worse despite getting treatments to lower the testosterone levels in the body.
“Metastatic” means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
The study drug MEDI3726 was designed to recognize and kill the tumor cells responsible for the
spread of mCRPC in the body.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI3726 in participants with
mCRPC.
