Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have advanced
PRCC. “Advanced” means that the cancer has spread from where it started to
other parts of the body and cannot be treated with surgery. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it
is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well savolitinib works
compared to sunitinib in participants with advanced PRCC. Sunitinib is a drug that
is often used to treat this type of cancer. The researchers also wanted to find out if
the participants had any medical problems during the study.
PRCC is a kidney cancer that can be caused by changes in the DNA of different
genes. There are treatments for kidney cancers, but none of these were developed
to treat PRCC specifically.
Savolitinib was developed to slow the growth of tumor cells with changes in a gene
called the MET gene. Research has shown that changes in the DNA of the MET
gene can make PRCC tumors grow faster.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if savolitinib slowed tumor growth
compared to sunitinib in participants with PRCC that had changes in the MET
gene. The researchers compared savolitinib with the kidney cancer drug sunitinib.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did savolitinib slow the participants’ tumor growth compared to sunitinib?
• Did the participants’ quality of life change after taking study treatment?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women with advanced PRCC that had been caused by a change in the MET
gene. They had never taken sunitinib before or any treatment that works in the
same way as savolitinib. The participants in this study were 23 to 78 years old.
