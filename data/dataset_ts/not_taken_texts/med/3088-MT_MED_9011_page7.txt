Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment.
A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse
reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during
this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?

How many participants had adverse reactions?

How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
These results helped the researchers learn more about ZS and if it can help
lower potassium levels in the body.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments
work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this
one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with ZS in Chinese patients are planned.
