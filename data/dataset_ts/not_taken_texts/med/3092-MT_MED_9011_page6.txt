What was the purpose of this trial?
This was a “Phase 3” trial. In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out how
durvalumab alone, or durvalumab together with tremelimumab, worked in a
large number of participants with advanced HCC. They also wanted to find out if
the participants had any medical problems during the trial.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were:
X Did durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab help the
participants live longer than standard treatment?
X Did durvalumab alone help the participants live at least as long as
standard treatment?
X Did durvalumab alone help the participants live longer than standard
treatment?
X Did the participants feel that durvalumab and the higher dose of
tremelimumab affected their symptoms and quality of life compared with
standard treatment?
X Did the participants feel that durvalumab alone affected their symptoms and
quality of life compared with standard treatment?
X What medical problems did the doctors report as related to the trial
treatment?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other trials can be
done to find out if tremelimumab and durvalumab help improve the health of
people with advanced HCC.
