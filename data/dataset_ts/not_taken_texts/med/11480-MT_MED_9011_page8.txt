Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 2 participants who did not take all of their doses of study treatment.
The results from these participants were not counted.
Did AZD9567 affect how much glucose got into the participants’ blood
compared to prednisolone?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that taking AZD9567 did affect how much
glucose got into the participants’ blood compared to taking prednisolone.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the average total blood
glucose levels before treatment, and 4 hours after the participants ate a liquid
meal replacement followed by their study treatment. They did this for both
Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 for each group. The researchers then compared
the average total amount of glucose that got into the participants’ blood after
they took AZD9567 or prednisolone.
In Group 1, overall, the researchers found that the average total blood glucose
level was lower after the participants took AZD9567 compared with when they
took prednisolone.
There were not enough participants in Group 2 and Group 3 for the researchers
to know if taking AZD9567 or prednisolone, or taking prednisolone or placebo,
affected how much glucose got into the participants’ blood.
