Clinical Study Results
How did dapagliflozin affect the blood sugar levels of participants?
The researchers found that the participants who took dapagliflozin in Part 2 had
lower blood sugar levels than the participants who took the placebo in Part 2.
The researchers wanted to learn how dapagliflozin affects the blood sugar levels
in people with type 2 diabetes who already have damaged kidneys. High blood
sugar levels can lead to medical problems in people with type 2 diabetes.
The researchers measured the blood sugar levels of the participants at different
time points throughout this study.
After 24 weeks of treatment in Part 2:
157 participants who 0.37% average decrease
took dapagliflozin in blood sugar levels
159 participants who 0.03% average decrease
took the placebo in blood sugar levels
What medical problems did participants have?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
this study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened in this study.
