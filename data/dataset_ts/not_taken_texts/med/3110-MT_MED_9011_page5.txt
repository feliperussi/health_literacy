What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took study treatment, how long was it before their
cancer got worse?
X What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if olaparib on its own, or olaparib combined with ceralasertib or
adavosertib, can help slow the growth of tumors in people with metastatic triple
negative breast cancer.
