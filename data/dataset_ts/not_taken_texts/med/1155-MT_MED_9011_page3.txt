Clinical Trial Results
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
researchers, or staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting might affect
the results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly. You and the other
participants got either the 1-strain vaccine or the placebo. Which treatment participants
got was decided by chance, like rolling dice. For every 4 participants that got the 1-strain
vaccine, 1 participant got a placebo.
Your study included 300 healthy men and women who were 18 to 49 years old.
What happened during the study?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to 7 months.
Before the study started, study doctors did a physical examination, which included
checking your height, weight, and body temperature. Study doctors also asked about
your medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking. If you
are female, study doctors checked to see if you were pregnant.
After the study period was over, participants got either 1 dose of the 1-strain vaccine
or the placebo. Right before you got the 1-strain vaccine or a placebo, study doctors
did another physical examination. Study doctors also asked how you were feeling, if
you took any new medicines, and if you developed any new diseases. If you are female,
study doctors checked again to see if you were pregnant. Of the 300 participants, 241
participants got the 1-strain vaccine, and 59 participants got the placebo.
After treatment was over, researchers checked how you were feeling for about 180 days,
or 6 months, after getting the 1-strain vaccine or the placebo. They called you to ask how
you were feeling, if you took any new medicines, and if you developed any new diseases.
