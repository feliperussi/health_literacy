Clinical Trial Results
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in February 2016 and ended in October 2016. It included 63 participants at
2 study sites in the United States. When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and
created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before patients can take a new drug, the company developing it must do research studies to show
that the drug is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new drug is to test it in healthy people.
This means people without any serious health problems.
The study drug, AZD5634, is being developed to treat cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis affects the
cells that make mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. These fluids in the body are normally thin and
slippery. But the fluids in people with cystic fibrosis are thick and sticky. This can cause severe
damage to the lungs and the digestive system.
In this study, researchers compared AZD5634 with a placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but
contains no real medicine. Researchers use a placebo in studies so that they can compare the results
of participants who take study drugs with the results of participants who take no medicine at all.
In this study, researchers wanted to know:
• What medical problems did participants have after they got AZD5634 or the placebo?
• How did AZD5634 act in the body?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “single-blind” study. The participants did not know which drug they got, but
study staff found out which drug each participant got after the participants’ last visit. You and other
participants got the study drug or the placebo. Which treatment participants got was decided by
chance, like rolling dice. Your study included healthy men and women who were 20 to 50 years old.
What happened during the study?
This study had 2 parts: Part A and Part B. If you were in one part of the study, you could not be in the
other part of the study.
During Part A, participants were in the study for up to 3 months. All 57 participants visited their
study site 4 times. At the first visit, researchers made sure that participants could join the study.
During the second visit, participants stayed at the study site for 4 days. During this time, participants
got the study drug or the placebo through a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a machine that turns a liquid
medicine into a mist that you can breathe in through a mouthpiece.
The different doses of the study drug were given in micrograms, or μg. This is a widely accepted
scientific unit of measurement.
For every 3 participants who got AZD5634, 1 participant got the placebo.
