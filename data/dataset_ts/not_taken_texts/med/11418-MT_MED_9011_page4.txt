What happened during this study?
It was planned for each participant to be in the study for about 13 weeks, but the
study was stopped after just under 7 weeks. The study started in July 2020 and
ended in September 2020.
The study was stopped early because of unexpected safety results in a different
study that looked at how the dry powder form of AZD8154 worked in animals.
Although the researchers did not think that the dry powder AZD8154 was a risk
for the participants in this study, the animal safety results needed more research
before this study could continue.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
once. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study.
The doctors also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications, medical
problems, and smoking history
X took urine and blood samples
X checked the participants’ heart health by measuring blood pressure and
pulse, and by using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
X checked the participants’ lung health by measuring how much air they could
breathe in and out, the speed of their breath, and the number of breaths they
took every minute
