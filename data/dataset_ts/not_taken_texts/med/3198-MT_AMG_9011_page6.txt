7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
A main goal of the study was to learn how cinacalcet affects children and teenagers with
SHPT who took it for a long period of time.
Cinacalcet can help SHPT patients by lowering the level of PTH in the blood. Then, the
lower PTH levels result in lower calcium levels. When calcium gets very low, some
additional health problems can begin. These problems include weak and broken bones,
sudden uncontrolled brain activity (seizures), or problems with the timing of heart beats.
To learn about the safety of using cinacalcet in children and teenagers for a long time,
study doctors looked to see if any known possible risks were reported in this study.
