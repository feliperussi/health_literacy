Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers already did studies that showed that naloxegol worked for people who get
constipation from taking opioids for chronic pain not related to cancer. In this study, the
researchers wanted to find out more about how naloxegol works.
The researchers also wanted to learn if participants with this type of constipation
preferred taking naloxegol or another drug called PEG 3350 to treat their constipation.
PEG 3350 is 1 of the main ingredients in a drug that is already approved and is
commonly used to treat constipation.
Constipation is a medical problem that causes people to have less frequent bowel
movements, hard and dry stools, and difficulty emptying the bowels.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants with this type of constipation prefer taking naloxegol
or PEG 3350 to treat their constipation?
• Why did the participants prefer naloxegol or PEG 3350?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and
women with constipation from taking opioids for chronic pain not related to cancer.
The participants in this study were 28 to 81 years of age.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means both the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
This was also a “crossover” study. In a crossover study, all of the participants take all
of the treatments, but in a different order.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the treatments
were taken. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
