Level of tezepelumab in the blood over time
Overall, the researchers found that the level of tezepelumab in the blood over time was:
• 1,040 μg•day/mL for the participants who got tezepelumab through the vial and
syringe. This was for 103 out of 103 participants.
• 1,070 μg•day/mL for the participants who got tezepelumab through the accessorized
pre-filled syringe. This was for 104 out of 105 participants.
• 1,110 μg•day/mL for the participants who got tezepelumab through the auto-injector.
The figure below shows these results.
