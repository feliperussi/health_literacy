Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD. Researchers do clinical
studies to find out how a drug works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how GP MDI and FF MDI work
in participants with moderate to severe COPD. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
COPD is a lung disease that blocks the airways and makes it hard for air to flow
in and out of the lungs. It also causes shortness of breath. COPD gets worse over
time. Most people who develop COPD are current or former smokers.
GP MDI and FF MDI work by expanding the airways in the lungs. This can help
patients breathe better.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did GP MDI and FF MDI affect the participants’ lung airways?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of people
with moderate to severe COPD. The men and women in this study were 41 to
78 years old.
All of the participants in the study had smoked for at least 10 “pack-years”. This is
about the same as smoking an average of at least 1 pack of cigarettes a day for
10 years.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors,
other study staff, or the study sponsor knew what treatment each participant took.
Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants
are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research
sponsor found out which treatment the participants took so they could create a
report of the study results.
All the participants were asked to take both GP MDI and FF MDI at separate times
during the study. Some participants took GP MDI first and some participants took
FF MDI first.
