What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from Part B of this study. The results for each
individual participant might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at
the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
How did MEDI0382 affect the blood sugar levels and weight of
participants?
The researchers compared the blood sugar levels and weight of participants from
the start of Part B to their blood sugar levels and weight at the end of Part B.
To do this, the researchers used a scientific method called the “least square
mean” to calculate the results. The least square mean method takes missing
or incomplete data that could cause results to be inaccurate into account.
Researchers use this method to make sure study results are more accurate.
At the end of the study, the researchers found that the blood sugar levels and
weight of the participants who were given MEDI0382 decreased more than those
of the participants who were given the placebo.
