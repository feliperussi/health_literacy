A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatments each
participant took during each treatment part. This helps make sure the groups
are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each
treatment is as accurate as possible.
There were 2 main Parts to the study. There was a gap of more than 4 days
between Part 1 and Part 2. This was for the study treatments to fully leave the
participants’ bodies, also called “washing out”.
In Group 1, 20 participants were chosen to receive Treatment A first while the
other 20 participants received Treatment B first in Part 1. After the washout
gap, the treatments were swapped, so the Groups then took Treatment B or
Treatment A in Part 2.
In Group 2, 20 participants were chosen to receive Treatment C first while the
other 20 participants received Treatment D first in Part 1. After the washout
gap, the treatments were swapped, so the Groups then took Treatment D or
Treatment C in Part 2.
