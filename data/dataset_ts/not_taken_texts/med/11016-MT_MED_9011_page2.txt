Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have a type of heart
failure called HFpEF. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about
how dapagliflozin works in people with HFpEF. Researchers already did studies that
showed dapagliflozin worked for people with other types of heart failure.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
treatment but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> After 16 weeks, did the participants feel that dapagliflozin helped their
overall heart failure symptoms?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin did not feel that it helped
their overall heart failure symptoms after 16 weeks.
> After 16 weeks, did the participants feel that dapagliflozin helped their
physical symptoms caused by heart failure?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin did not feel that it helped
their physical symptoms caused by heart failure after 16 weeks.
> After 16 weeks, could the participants who took dapagliflozin walk
farther in 6 minutes?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin could not walk farther in 6
minutes after 16 weeks.
