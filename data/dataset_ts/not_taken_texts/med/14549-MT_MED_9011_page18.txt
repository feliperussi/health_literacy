How many participants had Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events?
Overall, 1.5% of participants had a Grade 3 adverse event. This was 375 out of
24,244 participants.
• 1.7% of participants who received AZD1222 had a Grade 3 adverse event. This
was 211 out of 12,282 participants.
• 1.4% of participants who received the MenACWY or saline control had a Grade 3
adverse event. This was 164 out of 11,962 participants.
Overall, 0.3% of participants had a Grade 4 adverse event. This was 82 out of
24,244 participants.
• 0.4% of participants who received AZD1222 had a Grade 4 adverse event. This

What do the results of the trials mean?
Based on these results, the researchers consider AZD1222 to be generally well
tolerated and 66.7% effective overall at preventing symptomatic COVID-19
confirmed by a positive test.
These calculations are based on 332 symptomatic COVID-19 infections confirmed
by a positive test, out of 17,178 participants. This means the efficacy of AZD1222
is higher than the minimum requirement from the FDA and the WHO.
In general, vaccines are considered to be safe. This is because many years of
research has provided data that have been measured and carefully analysed for
all vaccines. The safety results for AZD1222 were similar to the controls and the
safety results that researchers have seen for other vaccines.
