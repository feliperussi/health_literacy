or 155. 2 out of every
8 participants got the placebo.
During the study, study doctors checked each participant’s blood pressure, pulse rate,
and temperature. They also tested participants’ blood and urine to make sure the
participants were still healthy. Finally, study doctors checked participants’ hearts using an
electrocardiogram, or ECG. Study doctors also asked participants how they were feeling.
After the treatments were over, participants returned to the study center for a follow-up visit
7 to 10 days after treatment. During this visit, study doctors took additional blood and urine
samples, and asked participants how they were feeling. Researchers also did an ECG
to check participants’ heart health, and did a full physical examination.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this
study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide
which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD9567
are ongoing.
How did AZD9567 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to see how the study drug acted in the body. They wanted to know:
• The average amount of AZD9567 in the blood
• The highest amount of AZD9567 in the blood
• How long it took for AZD9567 to reach its highest amount in the blood
