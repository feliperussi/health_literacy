Clinical Study Results
They compared the averages as a percentage. They did this for each part of the study.
If the percentage was between 80% and 125%, the researchers considered the amounts of
dapagliflozin or metformin in the blood to be the similar. A percentage higher than 100% meant
that there was more of the drug from the tablet made in the mainland United States in the blood.
A percentage lower than 100% meant that there was more of the drug from the tablet made in
Puerto Rico in the blood.
Part 1
When comparing the tablets made in Puerto Rico to the tablets made in the mainland United
States, the researchers found the following percentages.
• The average highest amount of drug found in the blood was:
- 104.4% for dapagliflozin
- 102.6% for metformin
• The average total amount of drug found in the blood was:
- 101.9% for dapagliflozin
- 105.0% for metformin
The chart below shows these results.
