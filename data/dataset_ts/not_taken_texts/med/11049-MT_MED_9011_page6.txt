The adverse events that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities. But, the participants had no serious
adverse events or adverse events that led the participants to stop taking the study
drug.
The study doctors also counted the number of dose limiting toxicities the
participants had during the study. A dose limiting toxicity is an adverse event that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant’s dose
of study treatment. A dose limiting toxicity is also known as a “DLT”. None of the
participants had a DLT.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the
study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse
reaction.
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
None of the participants had any serious adverse reactions, adverse reactions
that led the participants to stop taking the study drug, or adverse reactions that
resulted in death.
