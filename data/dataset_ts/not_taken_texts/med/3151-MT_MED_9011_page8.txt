Compared to the participants who got durvalumab and the placebo, the
participants who got durvalumab and olaparib had a 6.0% reduced risk of their
cancer getting worse during the study.
Overall, this number was too small for the researchers to know if durvalumab and
olaparib helped the participants live longer with their cancer before it got worse.
Did the participants feel that getting durvalumab and olaparib together
helped with their symptoms and quality of life?
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete
a questionnaire. This questionnaire was called the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire – Core 30, also
known as EORTC QLQ-C30.
The answers to the questionnaire were given “scores” based on the severity of
the participants’ symptoms and their quality of life. The researchers measured how
much the participants’ scores changed during the study.
The researchers compared the changes in the scores for the participants who got
durvalumab and olaparib with those who got durvalumab and the placebo.
Overall, the researchers found that participants in both treatment groups had a
little more fatigue and that their quality of life got a little worse during the study.
But, there were no overall meaningful differences in symptoms and quality of life
between the participants who got durvalumab and olaparib and the participants
who got durvalumab and the placebo.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
