Clinical Study Results
Part 3
In Part 3, there were 2 groups of participants. These participants got either
MEDI3506 or the placebo through IV treatment.
Within each group, a computer program was used to randomly choose the
treatment each participant got. This helps make sure the treatments are chosen
fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants got.
