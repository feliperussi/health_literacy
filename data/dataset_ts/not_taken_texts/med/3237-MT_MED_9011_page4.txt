Clinical Study Results
In Part 1, a computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which
each participant got each treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen
fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
In Part 2, the participants completed Treatment Period C first, and then Treatment
Period D. A computer program was also used to randomly choose the order in
which each participant completed Treatment Periods E and F.
The participants waited up to 4 weeks between each treatment period.
What happened during the study?
Up to 28 days before the participants got study treatment, they visited
their study site once. At this visit, the study doctors checked the overall health of
the participants to make sure that they could join the study. The study doctors:
• asked the participants about their health and about any medications they
were taking
• did a physical exam
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• did a breath test to check for smoking and alcohol use
The doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
Each treatment period lasted about 7 days. During each treatment period,
the participants visited their study site on Day 1 and stayed overnight for 4 nights.
During this time, the participants got their dose of AZD4635 in the morning on
Day 2. The participants returned for 2 more visits on Days 6 and 7.
