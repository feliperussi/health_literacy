Clinical Study Results
During the study, there were 2 parts, called the “treatment period” and the “observation
period”. Throughout both parts, the study doctors:
• checked the participants’ lung health, asthma symptoms, and overall health
• checked the participants’ surveys that asked them about their asthma symptoms and
how they felt
During the treatment period, the participants visited their study site 13 times over the
course of 12 weeks. They continued taking their normal asthma treatments at first during
this time period, but these treatments were slowly decreased and then stopped.
During these 12 weeks, the participants inhaled either AZD1419 or the placebo treatment
13 times. For the first 4 treatments of AZD1419, the dose was 4 mg.
The researchers carefully studied the results and checked the health of the participants to
decide what the next doses should be. For each of the next 9 treatments, the participants
inhaled 1 of the below doses:
• 1 mg of AZD1419
• 4 mg of AZD1419
• 8 mg of AZD1419
After the participants took these last 9 treatments, the observation period of the study
started.
During the observation period, the participants visited their study site 6 times
over the course of 36 weeks. At these visits, the study doctors continued to check the
participants’ lung health, asthma symptoms, and overall health. They also gave the
participants more surveys that asked them about their asthma symptoms and how they
felt.
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site 1 time 4 weeks after
their last observation period visit. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants’
lung health, asthma symptoms, and overall health.
