Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug dapagliflozin.
You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about dapagliflozin to help people
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, also called T2DM.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of the
study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped
prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel
proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the study
doctor or staff at your study site.
Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with T2DM. Before a drug can be
approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
This study was divided into 2 parts. All of the participants took dapagliflozin in 1 part of the study
and a placebo in the other part. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
The 2 parts of the study were 6 to 8 weeks apart.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did dapagliflozin affect the amount of glucose that left the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
