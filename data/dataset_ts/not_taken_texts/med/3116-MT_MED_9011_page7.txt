best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant in the tezepelumab group and 1 participant in the placebo
group who did not get any study treatment. So, the results in this summary are
from the 1,059 participants who got study treatment.
Did tezepelumab affect the number of asthma attacks over 1 year?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that tezepelumab reduced the participants’
number of asthma attacks over 1 year.
To answer this question, the researchers calculated the number of asthma attacks
the participants had during the 1 year of study treatment. This is known as the
“annual rate”. Then, they compared the annual rate of asthma attacks between
the participants who got tezepelumab with those who got the placebo.
