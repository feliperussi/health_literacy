What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did ticagrelor lower the number of pain crises that the participants had during
the study?
> Did the participants feel that ticagrelor helped their symptoms and quality of
life?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to help know if ticagrelor can be
given to improve the health of children and teenagers with SCD.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either ticagrelor or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to
help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug
are a result of taking the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, their parents
or caregivers, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment
each participant was taking. Some studies of this type are done this way because
knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the
study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the
participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took ticagrelor or the placebo as tablets by mouth twice a day.
The doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg. The dose each participant
took depended on their body weight.
