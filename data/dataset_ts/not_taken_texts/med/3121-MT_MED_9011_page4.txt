What happened during this study?
The researchers planned for the participants to take study treatment for 24
weeks, which is about 6 months. This study was ended early by the sponsor.
Some participants completed all 24 weeks of study treatment before the study
was ended. Other participants were in the study for less time because the study
was ended before they could complete the study treatment, or because they left
for another reason.
The entire study lasted for about 1 and a half years. The study started in
December 2017 and ended in May 2019.
