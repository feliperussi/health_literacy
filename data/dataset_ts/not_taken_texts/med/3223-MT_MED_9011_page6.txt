The study started in November 2018 and ended in March 2020.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time.
This part of the study lasted for 2 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors made sure
the participants could join the study. They also:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
> took blood samples to check the participants’ blood potassium levels
> took blood and urine samples for testing
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.

their study site 5 times. Because of country requirements, the participants in the
United Kingdom visited their study site more often. They visited up to a total of 8
times and had extra tests to measure their blood potassium levels. This part of the
study lasted 4 weeks.
