Thank you!
As a clinical study participant, you belong to a large community of participants
around the world. You help researchers answer important health questions
and discover new medical treatments.
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drug AZD7986. This
drug is currently being developed to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or COPD, which is a chronic inflammation of the lungs that causes
blockage of the airways and makes it difficult to breathe. New and better
drugs are needed in the treatment of this disease, which can be very serious
in many patients. You and all of the other participants helped researchers
learn how AZD7986 affects the body.
AstraZeneca AB, the sponsor of this study, thanks you for your help
and thinks it is important for you to know the results of your study. An
Independent non-profit organisation called CISCRP prepared this summary
of the study results for you with the help of a medical writing organisation.
We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in
medical research. If you have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
