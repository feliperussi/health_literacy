Clinical Study Results
How did benralizumab act in the body when taken in 2 different injection
devices?
The researchers wanted to learn how benralizumab acts in the body when taken
in 2 different injection devices. So, for both treatments, they measured:
• the average amount of benralizumab in the blood
• the highest amount of benralizumab in the blood
• how long it took for benralizumab to reach its highest amount in the blood
In general, the researchers found that the 2 different injection device treatments
of benralizumab acted similarly in the body.
What medical problems did the participants have?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think
might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study
drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary. Because
there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps
protect their identities. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other
information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how benralizumab acts in the body when it is taken
in 2 different injection devices.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Further clinical studies with benralizumab are planned.
