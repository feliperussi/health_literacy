Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have different types of cancer.
Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of different doses of
MEDI9197 in participants with advanced cancer that was no longer responding to standard
treatment. The cancer could be either solid tumor cancers or a type of cancer that affects the skin
called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL. They also wanted to learn about the safety
of MEDI9197 when it was taken together with other cancer treatments. The researchers also
wanted to know if the participants had any medical problems during the trial.
When cells become abnormal, they can grow out of control and form tumors. This is also called
cancer. MEDI9197 is designed to work by stimulating the immune system to identify and kill the
abnormal tumor cells. There are other studies with similar drugs to MEDI9197, that suggest that
advanced cancers may respond well to this type of treatment.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants’ safety results change after taking MEDI9197?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that
help find out if MEDI9197 improves the health of people with advanced cancer that was no
longer responding to standard treatment.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced cancer that is no longer
responding to standard treatment. Everyone in the study was 25 to 85 years old when they
joined. The participants had previously received treatment that did not work or was no longer
working when they enrolled in this study.
