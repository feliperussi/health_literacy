Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if MEDI0382 helps improves the health of people who have obesity.
What treatments did the participants take?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors,
or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking. Some studies are done
this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the
study. When the study ended, the research sponsor created a report of the study results.
There were 3 different treatment groups in this study. In each group, the participants took either
MEDI0382 or a placebo once a day as an injection under the skin. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the
effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Overall, 36 participants took MEDI0382 and 15 participants took a placebo:
• In Group 1, 12 participants took MEDI0382 and 3 participants took a placebo.
• In Group 2, 12 participants took MEDI0382 and 6 participants took a placebo.
• In Group 3, 12 participants took MEDI0382 and 6 participants took a placebo.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants who took MEDI0382 took increasing doses throughout the study. The doses
were measured in micrograms, also known as μg.
