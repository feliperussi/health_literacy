What is happening with the study now?
The study started in November 2017 and ended in January 2018. The study

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers need to do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
Different forms of the study drug, MEDI0382, are being developed to treat people
with type 2 diabetes. In this study, the researchers wanted to compare how 2 of
these forms acted in the blood in healthy participants. They also wanted to find out
if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
