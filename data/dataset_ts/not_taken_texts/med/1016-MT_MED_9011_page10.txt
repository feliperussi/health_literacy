Clinical Study Results
The researchers collected information on all serious adverse reactions that led
to the death of any participants. There were 0.2% of participants who died from a
serious adverse reaction during the study. This was 11 out of 4,736 participants.
• 0.3% of participants in the dapagliflozin group died from a serious adverse
reaction. This was 6 out of 2,368 participants.
• 0.2% of participants in the placebo group died from a serious adverse reaction.
This was 5 out of 2,368 participants.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
Because the researchers did not collect information about all medical problems in
the study, they could not calculate how many participants had adverse reactions
overall.
The researchers collected information on all adverse reactions that led to any
participants stopping their study treatment. There were 1.7% of participants who
stopped taking their study treatment because of an adverse reaction. This was 79
out of 4,736 participants.
• 1.7% of participants in the dapagliflozin group stopped taking their study
treatment because of an adverse reaction. This was 40 out of 2,368
participants.
• 1.6% of participants in the placebo group stopped taking their study treatment
because of an adverse reaction. This was 39 out of 2,368 participants.
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
Because the researchers did not collect information about all medical problems in
the study, they could not calculate the most common adverse reactions overall.
