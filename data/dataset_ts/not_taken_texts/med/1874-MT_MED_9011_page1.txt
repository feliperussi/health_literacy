Drug studied: AZD8871
Short study title: A study to learn if AZD8871 helps people with chronic

Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drug AZD8871. You and
all of the participants helped researchers learn more about AZD8871 to help
people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share
the results of the study with you and the public. An independent, non-profit
organization called CISCRP and a medical writing organization called
Synchrogenix helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it
helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to about 4 months. But
the entire study took about 9 months to finish. The study started in December
2016 and ended in August 2017.
The study included 42 participants at 2 study sites in Germany and the United
Kingdom. Even though 42 participants joined this study, only 31 participants
completed the study. Researchers could not always use the information from the
participants who did not complete the study. This means that some of the results
in this summary are only from 31 participants.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
