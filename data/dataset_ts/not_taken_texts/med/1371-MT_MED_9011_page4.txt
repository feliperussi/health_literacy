What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions the
researchers wanted to answer can be found on the website listed at the end of this
summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on this website.
Some of the participants left the study before it was completed, so the researchers
weren’t able to study some of the results for all 276 of the participants.
Which treatment did participants prefer to treat their constipation?
The researchers wanted to learn if the participants preferred taking naloxegol or
PEG 3350 to treat their constipation. So, the researchers gave the participants a
questionnaire after they completed both treatment periods and asked them if they
preferred naloxegol or PEG 3350, or had no preference between the 2 treatments.
Overall, a similar number of participants preferred naloxegol to PEG 3350.
Of the 246 participants that the researchers could study the results for:
• 50.4% of the participants preferred naloxegol. This was 124 of the 246 participants.
• 48.0% of the participants preferred PEG 3350. This was 118 of the 246 participants.
• 1.6% of the participants had no preference between the 2 treatments. This was 4 of
the 246 participants.
