Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI3902 affect the number of participants who developed
bacterial pneumonia?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were differences in the percentage of
participants who developed bacterial pneumonia among the treatment groups. But,
the researchers did not consider these differences to be meaningful.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of participants in
each treatment group who developed bacterial pneumonia within 3 weeks of
getting treatment. Then, they calculated the percentage in each treatment group
and compared the results.
Overall, the researchers found that the treatment group that got 1,500 mg of
MEDI3902 had the highest percentage of participants who developed bacterial
pneumonia. The researchers also found that the treatment group that got 500 mg
of MEDI3902 had the lowest percentage of participants who developed bacterial
pneumonia.
The researchers found that 3 weeks after treatment:
• 12.5% of participants who got 500 mg of MEDI3902 developed bacterial pneumonia.
This was 2 out of 16 participants.
• 22.4% of participants who got 1,500 mg of MEDI3902 developed bacterial pneumonia.
This was 19 out of 85 participants.
• 18.1% of participants who got the placebo developed bacterial pneumonia. This was
15 out of 83 participants.
