Clinical trial results
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to 15 weeks. One
participant did not follow the treatment visit schedule and was only present
for 3 of the 6 treatment periods. This participant did not complete the study.
Before the study started, researchers did tests to check your health and
asked you questions to make sure you could join the study. Researchers did
a physical examination, which included checking your height, weight, and
body temperature. Researchers tested samples of your urine and blood to
check your overall health, and they did an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to
check your heart health. Researchers also asked about your medical history,
how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
In this study, participants got 2 different types of inhalers. The first type of
inhaler delivers medicine in a dry powder form. The second type of inhaler
delivers medicine in a spray form.
The abediterol treatments were given in micrograms, or μg. This is a
widely accepted scientific unit of measurement. You and all of the other
participants got all 6 inhaler treatments listed below in random order.
• 0.156 μg of abediterol in Inhaler 1
• 2.5 μg of abediterol in Inhaler 1
• 0.05 μg of abediterol in Inhaler 2
• 0.156 μg of abediterol in Inhaler 2
• 2.5 μg of abediterol in Inhaler 2
• Placebo
