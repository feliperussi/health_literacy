Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with asthma. The
participants in this study were 18 to 83 years old when they joined. The participants
were already taking a steady dose of asthma treatment including inhaled
corticosteroid, also called ICS. But, they were still having asthma symptoms.
The study included 806 participants in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Poland,
South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can
be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
it works and how safe it is.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow. This makes it
difficult to breathe. People with asthma may wheeze, cough, and have
shortness of breath and chest tightness. There are treatments that can help
control asthma symptoms, but these may not fully control asthma for some
people.
Asthma treatments are usually taken through an inhaler. The study drug,
AZD7594, is an inhaled treatment and works by reducing inflammation in the
breathing tubes to allow more air into the lungs. Researchers think this will
make it easier for people with asthma to breathe.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD7594 works in
participants with asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had
any medical problems during the study.
