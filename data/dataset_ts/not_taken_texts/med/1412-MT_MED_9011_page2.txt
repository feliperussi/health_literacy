Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. “Advanced”
usually means that the cancer keeps growing even with treatment. The cancer may
also be “metastatic”. This means that it has spread to other parts of the body or
has grown beyond the organ where it started. Normally, cells in the immune system
help stop tumors from growing. But in people with advanced solid tumors, the
tumor cells can interact with certain proteins on the immune cells. This may stop
the immune cells from recognizing the tumor cells and then attacking them.
The study drugs in MEDI9090, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were each
designed to stop the tumor cells from interacting with some of these proteins. This
lets the immune cells recognize and attack the tumor cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of both
durvalumab on its own and MEDI9090 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did any of the participants have immune reactions to MEDI9090 within the first
30 days of getting treatment?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if MEDI9090 helps improve the health of people with advanced
solid tumors.
