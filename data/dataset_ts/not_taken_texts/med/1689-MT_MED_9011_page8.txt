What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
To answer this question, the study doctors kept track of the “adverse events” that
the participants had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants
have during a study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in
studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study
treatments.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section is
a summary of all the adverse events, whether or not they might be related to
the study treatments. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
Of the 188 participants in this study, there were 4 participants who did not receive
treatment. This was because they did not meet the study guidelines or the study
doctors accidentally found out the treatment given to them. So, the below results
are for only 184 of the 188 participants.
