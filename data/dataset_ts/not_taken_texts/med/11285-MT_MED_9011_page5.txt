Lung function over 24 weeks:
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together
had increased lung function before taking a treatment dose than participants who took
formoterol fumarate by itself. They were able to exhale an average of 39 mL more air than
participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself.
• The participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together
had increased lung function before taking a treatment dose than participants who took
formoterol fumarate by itself. They were able to exhale an average of 34 mL more air than
participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself.
