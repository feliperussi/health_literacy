Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
combination of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate, also called AB/FF. You
and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about using AB/FF to help
people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical
research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 5 weeks. But, the entire study
took about 6 months to finish. The study started in December 2017 and ended in
June 2018.
The study included 20 participants in China.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
