Clinical Study Results
Did the participants’ safety results change after they started study
treatment?
No. Overall, the participants’ safety results did not change throughout the study.
To answer this question, the researchers did the following throughout the study:
• performed physical examinations and checked participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• checked participants’ heart health using an ECG
There were some changes in the results of these tests throughout the study, but these
changes were too small for the researchers to consider them meaningful.
The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities, also called DLTs,
that the participants had during the study. A DLT is a medical problem that is serious
enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant’s study treatment dose.
Overall, the researchers found that:
• None of the participants in Group 1 had DLTs during the study.
• 20.0% of the participants in Group 2 had DLTs during the study. This was 4 out of
20 participants.
The number of DLTs was too small for the researchers to know if the DLTs were related
to the study treatment.
In this study, the researchers also collected information about how many adverse events
the participants had. An adverse event is any medical problem that happens during the
study. Adverse events are considered “serious” when they are life-threatening, cause
lasting problems, or require hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by
the study drugs.
What serious adverse events did the participants have?
There were 73.9% of participants who had serious adverse events during the study.
This was 17 out of 23 participants.
