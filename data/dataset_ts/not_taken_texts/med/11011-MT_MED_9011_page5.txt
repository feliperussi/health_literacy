Clinical Study Results
Overall, the researchers found that after the participants got both forms of AZD7594:
• The total amount of AZD7594 in the blood during the study was higher for the
inhaled form compared to the IV form.
• The total amount of AZD7594 in the blood at the end of the study was higher
for the inhaled form compared to the IV form.
• The highest amount of AZD7594 in the blood during the study was higher for
the IV form compared to the inhaled form.
What medical problems did the participants
have during the study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps to protect their identities.
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors
think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems,
or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the
study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse
reaction.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how AZD7594 acts in the body.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD7594 are planned.
