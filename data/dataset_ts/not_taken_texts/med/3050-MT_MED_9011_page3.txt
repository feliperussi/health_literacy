Clinical Study Results
Researchers wanted to find out if AZD8871 was safe to take for the Japanese
participants in this study. So, they checked the health of participants several times
throughout the study. In general, the researchers found that participants who took the
different doses of AZD8871 had about the same number of medical problems as the
participants who took the placebo. No participants had any medical problems that the
researchers thought were serious.
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think
might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions.” An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study
drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary. Because
there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps
protect their identities. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other
information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn if AZD8871 was safe to take for the Japanese
participants in this study.
The results presented here are for a single study. Researchers look at the results of
many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary
shows only the main results from this 1 study. Other studies may provide new
information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment
changes.
Further clinical studies with AZD8871 are planned.
