Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
To see if the participants could join the study, the doctors did a physical examination by
checking their height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. The doctors took
blood and urine samples and also asked about the medical history of the participants, how
they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
All of the participants in this study took both naloxegol and PEG 3350. Some of the
participants took naloxegol first, and some of the participants took PEG 3350 first.
The study treatments are listed below:
• 25 milligrams, also known as mg, of naloxegol
• 17 grams of PEG 3350
Naloxegol was taken in pill form. PEG 3350 was taken as a powder that the participants
mixed into a liquid and drank.
All of the participants who completed the study visited their study site 5 times.
The participants in the study took either the naloxegol or the PEG 3350 treatment once a
day for 2 weeks. Then, they had a “washout period” of 1 week. During the washout period,
the participants were not allowed to take certain medications. These medications included
the study drugs and any other medications that help with constipation. A washout period
means that their bodies had time to process the medications in their blood and wash out
remaining medications before they took the next treatment.
After the washout period:
• the participants who had taken naloxegol then took PEG 3350 once a day for 2 weeks
• the participants who had taken PEG 3350 then took naloxegol once a day for 2 weeks
Throughout the study, the doctors checked the health of the participants.
