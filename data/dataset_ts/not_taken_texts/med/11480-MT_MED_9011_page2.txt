Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat inflammation in people
who have type 2 diabetes. Before a drug can be approved for people to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe
it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took different combinations of AZD9567,
prednisolone, and a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not
have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did AZD9567 affect how much glucose got into the participants’
blood compared to prednisolone?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that taking AZD9567 decreased
how much glucose got into the participants’ blood compared with
taking prednisolone. “Glucose” is also known as blood sugar.
X What medical problems happened during this study?
There were 2.4% of participants who had medical problems that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments
during the study. The only medical problem was having high levels of
blood glucose.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this
summary.
