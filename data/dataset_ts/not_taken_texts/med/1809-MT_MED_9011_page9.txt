Clinical Study Results
The most common DLTs were a decrease in the number of a type of white blood
cell called neutrophils, and a decrease in the number of blood-clotting fragments
called platelets.
Did the participants’ safety results change after taking adavosertib and
olaparib?
This was the main question that the researchers wanted to answer in Part B. This
is because all of the participants in Part B took 200 mg of adavosertib once daily
for 6 days per cycle and 200 mg olaparib twice daily.
To help answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the
participants’ vital signs and blood tests before and after the participants took study
treatment in Part B.
Overall, the researchers found that there was no change in the participants’ vital
signs before and after treatment in this part.
They found that there were some changes in the participants’ blood cell counts,
blood proteins, and blood minerals compared to before they took study treatment.
These changes were similar to results in earlier studies with adavosertib and
olaparib.
Adverse events
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had in Part
B. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do
not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. This section is a
summary of all the adverse events in Part B, whether they might be related to the
study treatments or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is
life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
