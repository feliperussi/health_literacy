The researchers found that 7 hours after the allergen challenge, the participants’
eosinophil levels increased by an average of:
> 0.8% for the participants who got benralizumab
> 6.5% for the participants who got the placebo

Benralizumab Placebo
Did benralizumab affect the amount of air the participants could
breathe out after an allergic trigger?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the
amount of air the participants could breathe out in both groups of participants.
But, these differences were too small for the researchers to know if benralizumab
affected the participants’ breathing compared with the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the average amount of air the
participants could breathe out in 1 second.
