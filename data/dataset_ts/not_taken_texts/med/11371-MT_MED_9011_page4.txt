What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
X Did acalabrutinib when added to BSC help the participants stay alive and
breathe without help?
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions were important to know before doing other
studies to find out if acalabrutinib helps improve the health of people with
COVID-19.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got either:
X acalabrutinib and “best supportive care”, also called BSC
X BSC only
BSC was decided for each participant by their study doctor. The participants who
got acalabrutinib took it as a capsule by mouth. The doses of acalabrutinib were
measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got study treatment while they were already in the hospital
because of COVID-19.
