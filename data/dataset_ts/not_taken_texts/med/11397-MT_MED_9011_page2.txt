Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 21 to 54 years old when they joined.
The study included 39 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to treat the coronavirus disease, also called
COVID-19. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COVID-19 can cause swelling in the airways and lungs. This can lead to lung
damage, difficulty breathing, and other medical problems. If the swelling is severe,
people who have COVID-19 may have a breathing tube inserted and may not be
able to swallow a pill. They may also have increased stomach acid while they have
a breathing tube in.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of cancer. Based on
a study in a small number of people with COVID-19, researchers thought that
acalabrutinib might be able to decrease swelling in the lungs and airways. Some
people with COVID-19 who go to hospital may need a tube and ventilator to help
them breathe.
People who are breathing with a ventilator are often given antacids to prevent
ulcers. Earlier studies in healthy volunteers have shown that when there is less
stomach acid, it is harder for acalabrutinib to get into the blood. Researchers
in that small study gave the participants flat Coca-Cola with their dose of
acalabrutinib. The Coca-Cola added some acid to the stomach to help
acalabrutinib get into the blood.
The researchers in this study wanted to learn more about how acalabrutinib and
its metabolite acted in the blood in healthy participants when given this way. A
metabolite is a substance that the body makes when it breaks down a drug. The
body removes metabolites through fluids, such as urine or sweat.
