Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced HNSCC. Before a drug
can be approved for people to use as a standard treatment, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how effective and safe it is. Researchers already did studies that
showed durvalumab reduced the size of tumors and helped the participants with
lung cancer who were in those studies live longer.
When this study started, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab and
tremelimumab together worked in a large number of participants with HNSCC.
They also wanted to find out if the participants had any adverse reactions during
the study. After this study had started, another study showed that durvalumab
and tremelimumab together were not any more effective for most participants
with HNSCC than durvalumab by itself. Because of this new information, the
researchers updated the goal of this study to measure how well durvalumab alone
worked in participants with HNSCC. Even though the goal of the study changed,
the researchers continued to collect information about how well tremelimumab
works, how safe it is and about how the participants felt while they were getting it.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. When cancer progresses to a late stage, tumors spread to
other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started. Sometimes
the tumors are too difficult to remove by surgery because of where they are in the
body or because there are too many of them.
Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing. But, in people
with head and neck cancer, the proteins on the tumor cells can interact with
certain proteins on the immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from being
able to attack the tumor cells.
