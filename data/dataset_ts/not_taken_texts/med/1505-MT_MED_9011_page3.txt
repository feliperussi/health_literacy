Clinical Study Results
The researchers wanted to learn if MEDI9314 is safe to take for patients with AD.
So, they studied the medical problems that the participants had during the study.
The researchers then compared the medical problems in the participants who got
MEDI9314 to the medical problems in the participants who got the placebo.
What medical problems did participants have?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors
think might be related to the study drugs are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems,
or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary.
Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information
out helps protect their identities. The website listed at the end of this summary may
have other information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn if MEDI9314 is safe to take for patients with AD.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a
doctor before making any treatment changes.
Further clinical studies with MEDI9314 may be planned in the future.
