Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma that is not well
controlled. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
Asthma is a disease that causes the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs
to become inflamed and narrow. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who
have asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
The study drug, tezepelumab, was designed to help reduce inflammation in the
airways in people with asthma. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out
if tezepelumab works in Japanese participants with asthma. They also wanted to
find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
