What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did the participants’ glycogen levels in the liver change after receiving
MEDI0382?
X What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out how MEDI0382 works in the liver in people with T2DM who
were likely to have NAFLD/NASH.
What treatments did the participants
receive?
The participants received MEDI0382 or a placebo through a needle under the
skin, also called an injection. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they
see in the participants who received the drug are actually caused by the drug.
The doses of MEDI0382 were measured in micrograms, also known as “µg”.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant received. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants,
researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each
participant was receiving.
Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are receiving can affect the results of the study. When the study
ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so
they could create a report of the study results.
