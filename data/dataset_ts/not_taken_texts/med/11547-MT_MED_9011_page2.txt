Overview of this trial
Why was the research needed? Page 4
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat low blood iron levels in
people with chronic kidney disease. After a drug is approved for people to
receive, researchers do more clinical trials to keep looking at how it works
and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants
receive? Page 6
The participants in this trial received roxadustat or another treatment called
recombinant human erythropoietin, which is also called “rHuEPO”.
What were the results of this trial? Page 9
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this trial was:
X Did roxadustat affect how much iron got into the participants’
blood compared with rHuEPO?
Overall, the differences between the groups were too small for the
researchers to know if roxadustat affected how much iron got into the
participants’ blood compared with rHuEPO.
More details about the results of this trial are included later in this summary.
What medical problems did the doctors report as
possibly related to the trial treatment? Page 10
There were 4.0% of participants who had medical problems that the trial
doctors reported as possibly being related to the trial drug. This was 1 out
of 25 participants. This participant had received roxadustat.
More details about the medical problems from this trial are included later in
this summary.
