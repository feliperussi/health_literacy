What medical problems happened during the
study?
In clinical studies, researchers keep track of the medical problems that
participants have that study doctors think might be related to the study
treatments. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
In this study, the researchers only wanted to learn if the participants taking
dapagliflozin had specific adverse reactions and to learn about all serious
adverse reactions. They did not require information on all adverse reactions to
be collected.
This section is a summary of these specific adverse reactions and all serious
adverse reactions that the study doctors thought might be related to
dapagliflozin. In this summary, these are called “adverse reactions of interest”
and “serious adverse reactions”.
These adverse reactions of interest and serious adverse reactions may or may
not be caused by dapagliflozin. When the participants had these adverse
reactions of interest and serious adverse reactions, the study doctors did not
know if they were taking dapagliflozin or the placebo.
There were 3 participants in each treatment group who left the study before
receiving study treatment. So, the results below include information for 4,298 of
the 4,304 participants.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
