As the researchers expected, they found the following results:
• The average and highest amounts of anifrolumab in the blood were
higher in participants who got a 600-mg infusion pump than in those
who got a 300-mg injection.
• The average amount of anifrolumab in the blood was higher in
participants who got 300 mg in an IV needle than in those who got
300 mg through an injection.
