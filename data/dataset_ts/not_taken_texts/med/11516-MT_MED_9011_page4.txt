The patients were also planned to get a proton pump inhibitor at least 2 days
before starting the acalabrutinib treatment. The study doctors decided the most
appropriate dose and the best way to give the proton pump inhibitor for each
patient.
What happened during this study?
The study started in September 2020 and ended early in November 2020.
This study ended early because of information available from other studies in
patients with COVID-19. The information showed that acalabrutinib did not help
the patients in other studies. Because the study ended early, some of the patients
did not get all of their study treatment.
Before the patients got study treatment, the study doctors visited them in
the hospital 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 3 days. At this visit, the
study doctors made sure the patients could join the study. They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the patients’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X did tests for COVID-19
X took blood and urine samples
X checked the patients’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an
“ECG”
X checked the patients’ lung health by looking at their oxygen use or need for a
ventilator
X if needed, took videos of the patients’ hearts and their heart chambers using
a tool known as an echocardiogram
X if needed, took X-rays or CT scans of the patients’ chests
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the
study.
While the patients got study treatment, they were supposed to get their
study treatment at the hospital for a total of 14 days, or until they were discharged
from the hospital. Because the study ended early, some of the patients did not get
all of their study treatment.
