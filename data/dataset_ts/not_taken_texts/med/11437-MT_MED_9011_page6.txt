Did flat Coca-Cola and rabeprazole affect how much acalabrutinib and
its metabolite got into the blood?
Yes. To answer this question, the study doctors measured:
X the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during treatment
X the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during treatment
The researchers compared the results for the participants who took acalabrutinib
with water and those who took rabeprazole and acalabrutinib with flat Coca-Cola.
Overall, the researchers found that the average total and average highest amounts
of acalabrutinib and its metabolite were lower in the participants who took
rabeprazole and acalabrutinib with flat Coca-Cola.
