Clinical Trial Results
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to about 15 weeks.
To see if you could join the study, study doctors did a physical examination by checking your
height, weight, and temperature. Study doctors took blood samples and checked your heart
health using an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Study doctors also asked about your medical
history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
In this study, participants took small, medium, and large particle sizes of AZD7594 through
an inhaler. Participants took all 3 treatments but in a random order.
During the study, you visited a study site 5 times. Study doctors did more physical
examinations, including checking your height, weight, and heart health. Study doctors
asked again about how you were feeling and what medicines you were taking.
There was a “washout period” of 21 to 28 days between taking each of the 3 treatments.
During the washout periods, participants did not take any drugs. This helped get rid of any
effects from previous treatments.
The figure below shows how the study was done.
