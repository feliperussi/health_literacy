Clinical Study Results
How long the participants lived after starting the study
To find out how long the participants lived after starting the study, the researchers used the
median length of time they lived.
The researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab alone lived longer after starting
the study compared to the participants who got SOC treatment. But, the difference between the
2 groups was too small for the researchers to consider this difference to be statistically
significant.
Overall, the researchers found that after starting the study:
• The participants who got durvalumab alone lived for a median of about 16.3 months.
• The participants who got SOC treatment lived for a median of about 12.9 months.
The figure below shows these results.

Did the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab together live longer
compared to the participants who got SOC treatment?
No. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab
together did not live significantly longer than the participants who got SOC treatment.
To answer this question, the researchers compared:
• the “hazard ratio” between the 2 groups
• how likely it was that the participants would be alive 2 years after starting the study
• how long the participants lived after starting the study
