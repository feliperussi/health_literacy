Clinical trial results
Part B
Overall, researchers found that:
• In Part B, participants who got the higher dose of AZD8871 had improved breathing.
• In Part B, participants’ breathing improved quickly and stayed improved for up to 36 hours
when they got AZD8871.
• In Part B, participants’ breathing improved more when they got both the 400 μg and 1800 μg
doses of AZD8871 compared to the placebo. Part B participants’ breathing improved more
when they got the 1800 μg dose of AZD8871 compared to both of the similar drugs.
How did AZD8871 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to learn how the study drug acted in the body. They wanted to know:
• The average amount of AZD8871 in the blood
• The highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood
• How long it took for AZD8871 to reach its highest amount in the blood
• The total amount of AZD8871 that left the body through urine in Part A
Part A
Overall, researchers found that:
• In Part A, participants who got higher doses of AZD8871 had higher average amounts of the
drug in the blood. Researchers thought this increase of AZD8871 was directly related to how
much of the study drug the participants got.
• In Part A, the highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood was generally greater when
participants got higher doses of the study drug. This highest amount was greatest for the
participants who got the 1800 μg dose. Researchers thought this increase of AZD8871 was
directly related to how much of the study drug the participants got.
• In Part A, it took between 0.9 to 1.5 hours for the AZD8871 doses to reach their highest
amount in participants’ blood.
• In Part A, the amount of AZD8871 eliminated from the body through urine was about 0.4% of
the AZD8871 dose that participants got. Researchers considered this to be a very low amount.
Part B
Overall, researchers found that:
• In Part B, participants who got higher doses of AZD8871 had higher average amounts
of the drug in the blood.
• In Part B, the highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood was greater when participants
got the 1800 μg dose compared to the 400 μg dose.
• In Part B, it took between 45 minutes to 3 hours for AZD8871 to reach its highest amount
in participants’ blood for the 400 and 1800 μg doses of the study drug.
