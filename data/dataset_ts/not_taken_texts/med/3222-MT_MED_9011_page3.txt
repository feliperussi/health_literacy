Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the doctors checked the overall health of the participants to
make sure that they could join the study. The doctors took blood and urine samples
from the participants. They also checked the heart health of the participants using an
electrocardiogram, also known as ECG.
During treatment, the participants visited the study site 4 times. At each site
visit participants stayed in the study center from the day before the treatment until
2 days after. Participants left the study center on the morning of day 3. The health of
participants was checked again and blood samples were taken to measure levels of the
drug in their body.
All participants took part in all 4 treatment periods where they took selumetinib either
as a capsule or as a granule, but in different orders. Treatments were measured in
milligrams, also known as mg.
In each of the 4 treatment periods during the study, participants received either:
• 25 mg, as a granule, without food
• 50 mg, as a capsule, without food
• 25 mg granule, with food
• 50 mg capsule, with food
All participants also took a single dose of acetaminophen with each dose of selumetinib.
Acetaminophen is a drug usually used to treat pain. But, in this study it helped
researchers measure how much selumetinib was taken up by the body.
All participants completed Part 1 of the study before Part 2. In Part 1, selumetinib was
taken without food. In Part 2, selumetinib was taken with food.
After treatment, the participants visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the doctors
checked the overall health of the participants.
