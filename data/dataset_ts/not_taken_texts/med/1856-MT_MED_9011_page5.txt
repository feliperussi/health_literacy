Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants received study treatment, they visited their study site one time.
At this visit, the study doctors checked their overall health and medical history to make sure they
could join the study. The study doctors:
• took blood and urine samples
• checked participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• used a needle to take a sample of the tumor tissue, also called a tumor biopsy
• did a physical exam and checked vital signs
• did imaging scans, including CT and MRI
During the study, the participants visited their study site at least 4 times. They received study
treatment based on what group they were in.
The study doctors checked the participants’ overall health, heart health, and vital signs and took
blood and urine samples throughout the study. They did this again after the last dose.
At the visit during week 4 of the study, the study doctors took a tumor biopsy.
After receiving the last dose, the participants visited their study site at least another 3 times
for at least 2 months.
At these visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ health and measured the size of their
tumors using a CT scan of the chest.
For the participants in Part 1, these visits continued every month until the participant started a
different treatment, their cancer got worse, or they left the study. For the participant in Part 2,
there was one more visit that happened after 6 months. For the participants in Part 3, these visits
continued every 12 weeks until the participant started a different treatment, their cancer got worse,
or they left the study.
