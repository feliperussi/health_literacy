Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before a
drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. Normally, the immune system fights infections or anything
it does not recognize, and can help stop tumors from growing or surviving. But in
people with advanced solid tumors, a protein on the tumor cells can interact with
certain proteins on the immune cells. This stops the immune cells from attacking
the tumor cells.
Durvalumab was designed to stop the tumor cells from interacting with some
of these immune cell proteins. This lets the immune cells stop the tumor from
growing. AZD9150 was designed to stop the tumor cells from surviving. It works
by suppressing the genes that help the tumor cells to survive.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD9150
alone or with durvalumab in Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors.
