Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants or the researchers
knew which treatment the participants took in each treatment period. Some studies are
done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect
the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
treatment each participant took in each treatment period so they could create a report
of the study results.
During the study, participants took either AZD6094, placebo, or moxifloxacin during each
treatment period. A computer program was used to randomly choose the order each
participant took these treatments. This helps make sure the treatments are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as
possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants started treatment, the doctors checked their overall
health and their heart health to make sure they could join the study. The doctors:
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
• checked the heart health of participants by doing a test called an electrocardiogram,
also known as an ECG, which is a recording of the heart’s rhythm
• took blood and urine samples
• did a physical examination
During the study, the participants visited the study site 3 times. At each visit, the
participants checked in to the study site the day before taking their assigned treatment.
They stayed at the site for at least 3 nights per visit. During each visit, the doctors
checked their overall health and their heart health as they did before.
Participants took 1 of the study treatments during each visit. Each visit was 14 days
apart. This allowed for any treatment that the participants were taking to be “washed
out” of their bodies before they continue taking the other treatments in this study.
