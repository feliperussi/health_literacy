best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Some of the participants left the study during Part 1 before they received any of the
study drug MEDI0382. So, the results below are for only 21 participants.
Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ body weight?
Yes. To answer this question, the study doctors checked the participants’ body
weight at the start of Part 2, and after they finished treatment in Part 2. Then, the
researchers calculated the percent change in the participants’ body weight.
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who were given MEDI0382
in Part 2 had a larger percent decrease in their body weight compared to the
participants who were given the placebo.
At the end of Part 2, the researchers found that:
• The participants who were given MEDI0382 had a 4.0% decrease in their body
weight. These results were for 14 participants.
• The participants who were given the placebo had a 1.4% decrease in their body
weight. These results were for 7 participants.
