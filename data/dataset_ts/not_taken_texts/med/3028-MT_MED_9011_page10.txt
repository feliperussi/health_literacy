Did the participants feel that durvalumab alone or together with
tremelimumab, with chemotherapy, affected their symptoms and quality
of life?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants in all treatment groups felt that
some specific symptoms improved after getting study treatment. The researchers
also found that the participants felt that their quality of life did not get worse
during the study.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete 2
different questionnaires. These were:
> The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
Life Questionnaire – Core 30, also known as EORTC QLQ-C30
> The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
Life Questionnaire – Lung Cancer 13, also known as EORTC QLQ-LC13
The answers to each questionnaire received a “score” based on the severity of
their symptoms or the quality of life. The main answers the researchers wanted to
compare were about fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, low appetite, and chest
pain. The researchers measured how much the participants’ scores changed over
1 year. A bigger change in score means that the symptoms got better.
