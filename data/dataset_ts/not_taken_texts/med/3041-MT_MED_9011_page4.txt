What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin as a tablet by mouth once a day. The treatment
doses were measured in milligrams, also written as “mg”.
Some of the participants in this study had T2D and healthy kidneys. The other participants did
not have T2D, but had low functioning kidneys. Throughout the study, the participants who had
T2D continued taking any treatments for T2D that they were on before the study.
The researchers also planned to include participants who had T2D and low functioning kidneys.
But, the researchers were not able to find enough of these participants to join this study. So, this
study did not include participants who had T2D and low functioning kidneys.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking.
The chart below shows the treatment the participants took.

What happened during the study?
The study started in July 2017 and ended in March 2020. The researchers ended the study early
before all planned participants joined the study.
During the study, the participants were given meals that contained the same amount of sodium.
The researchers did this so that the results were as accurate as possible. Throughout the study,
the participants who had T2D continued taking any treatments for T2D that they were on before
the study.
