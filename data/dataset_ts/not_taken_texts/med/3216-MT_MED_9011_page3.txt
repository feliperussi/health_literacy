Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
In this study, there were 4 treatment periods. Each treatment period was 7 days
long.
The participants took 1 dose of olaparib as a tablet on the first day of each
treatment period. There were 4 different doses of olaparib. It was planned that
during the study, each participant would take each of the 4 different doses.
They would take a different dose during each treatment period. The doses were
measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
These were:
• Dose A: 25 mg
• Dose B: 100 mg
• Dose C: 150 mg
• Dose D: 250 mg
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that each participant
took each dose. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each dose is as accurate as possible.
