Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who were already in
the hospital and were on breathing machines. These participants were at risk of
developing bacterial pneumonia. The participants were 22 to 89 years old when
they joined.
The study included 188 participants in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech
Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat bacterial pneumonia. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if MEDI3902 worked in participants
who were at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia. They also wanted to find out if
the participants had any medical problems during the study.
A common cause of pneumonia is breathing in harmful bacteria. These bacteria
can cause lung damage and other medical problems, such as coughing, wheezing,
and difficulty breathing.
Some people have a high risk of getting bacterial pneumonia and the medical
problems it can cause. This includes people who are in the hospital and on
machines to help them breathe.
