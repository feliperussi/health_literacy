Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat lupus. Before a drug can be approved for
patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if anifrolumab works in a large number of
participants with lupus. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems possibly related to the drug during the study.
Lupus is a disease of the immune system. This means that the body’s natural defense
system attacks healthy tissues. Lupus causes inflammation in the joints, in the skin
and in other organs. Researchers think that specific proteins in the body called “type 1
interferon” are involved in the inflammation that is caused by lupus. Anifrolumab stops the
type 1 interferon proteins from sending signals through the body. Researchers think that
this could reduce inflammation in patients with lupus.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out if giving the participants anifrolumab with
their current lupus treatment would reduce their lupus symptoms.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did anifrolumab improve the participants’ lupus symptoms that were the focus of the
study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women
with moderate to severe active lupus, which was based on many different measures of
lupus disease activity. They were already getting lupus treatment that did not reduce their
symptoms. Patients with lupus who had other diseases that can affect the study results
were not included. The participants in this study were 18 to 69 years old.
