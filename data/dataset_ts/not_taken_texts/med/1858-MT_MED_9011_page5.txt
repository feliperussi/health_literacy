Clinical Trial RESULTS
Average amount of AZD9567 in the blood
Researchers measured the average amount of AZD9567 in participants’ blood in nanomole
hours per liter of blood (h•nmol/L). This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.
After being swallowed by participants, AZD9567 was taken up quickly into the blood. This
process took about 1 hour.
AZD9567 also disappeared quickly from the blood. Roughly 5 hours after participants got
AZD9567, the original amount of the study drug in participants’ blood was cut in half.
The figure below shows this amount for the 8 AZD9567 treatment groups.
