Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 21 to 59 years old when they joined.
The study included 24 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with dyslipidemia. Before
a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
Dyslipidemia happens when people have high or abnormal levels of cholesterol
and other fats in their blood. This can lead to serious health problems such as
heart and blood vessel disease.
Researchers think that the study drug, AZD6615, could help people with
dyslipidemia.
What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of AZD6615 in
healthy participants.
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies
can be done to find out if AZD6615 helps improve the health of people with
dyslipidemia.
