To do this, the researchers kept track of any dose-limiting toxicities the participants
had during the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is a medical problem that is
serious enough to stop the study doctor from increasing a participant’s dose of
study treatment or give this or higher doses of study treatment to future study
participants.
This information may help researchers find out which doses of MEDI7247 to give
to future study participants.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
> Did any dose-limiting toxicities happen during the study?
> What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if MEDI7247 improves the health of people who have AML,
DLBCL, or MM.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got MEDI7247 through a needle into a vein. This is
known as an intravenous infusion, also called an IV infusion.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what dose of MEDI7247 each participant was
getting.
This was also a “dose-escalation” study. This means that some of the participants
started out getting a low dose of MEDI7247. The study doctors looked at the
results for these participants. Then, the researchers decided whether to increase
the dose of MEDI7247 in the next group of participants.
