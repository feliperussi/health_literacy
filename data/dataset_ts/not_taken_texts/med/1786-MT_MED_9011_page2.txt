Clinical Trial RESULTS
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in August 2015 and ended in August 2016. It included
51 participants at 5 study sites in the United States. When the study ended,
the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is
a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers were interested in better understanding the benefits of
Symbicort, a medicine used to treat COPD. COPD is a lung disease that causes
inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This may cause air to be trapped
in the lungs. This is known as “hyperinflation” and can make it harder to take
in each breath.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out how much oxygen the body uses
at rest when a participant’s hyperinflation improved after taking a dose of
Symbicort. If participants’ hyperinflation got any better, Symbicort may have
helped their hearts work better and may have helped change the amount of
oxygen their bodies used while at rest.
Researchers compared a single dose, or 2 puffs, of Symbicort with a placebo.
A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.
Researchers use placebos in studies to compare the results for participants
who take study drugs with the results for participants who take no medicine
at all. Researchers wanted to know:
• Was there a link between Symbicort and the amount of oxygen used
throughout the body compared to a placebo?
• Was there a link between Symbicort and a change in the strain on the
heart compared to a placebo?
• What medical problems did participants have after they
took Symbicort?
