Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart attacks. Before a drug can
be approved for people to receive, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if MEDI6012 worked in
participants who were having a heart attack. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
STEMI heart attacks are usually caused by a complete blockage in the arteries that
supply blood to the heart. This causes serious damage to the heart tissue. The
damaged tissue is called an “infarct”.
The main treatment for a heart attack is called “pPCI”, which is a procedure that
aims to quickly remove the blockage and to keep the arteries open. The study
drug, MEDI6012, was designed to be given to patients before pPCI. Researchers
think that MEDI6012 may help protect the heart tissues from becoming damaged
after a heart attack. It also acts to increase the amount of good cholesterol and a
protein called “apoA1” in the blood, which might help to reduce the amount of
cholesterol plaque in the arteries.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if MEDI6012 reduces the size of
infarcts in people who have recently had a heart attack.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did MEDI6012 help to reduce heart muscle damage after a heart attack?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies
can be done to find out if MEDI6012 helps improve the health of people after
a heart attack.
