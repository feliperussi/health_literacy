Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug

to help people who have stable coronary heart disease, also called stable CHD.
MedImmune, LLC, a member of the AstraZeneca group, sponsored this study and
thinks it is important to share the results of the study with the participants and the
public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and
feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak

What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 5 months. But the entire study
took about 11 months to finish.
The study started in December 2017 and ended in November 2018. It included
132 participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
