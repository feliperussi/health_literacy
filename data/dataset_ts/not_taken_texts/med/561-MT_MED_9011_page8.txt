Clinical Study Results
Did the HbA1c levels in the participants’ blood decrease after 1 year?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the HbA1c levels decreased over 1 year
in the participants who took dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin and in those
who took glimepiride and metformin. They found that there was a bigger overall
decrease in the participants who took dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of HbA1c in the
participants’ blood before and after they took treatment in the study. HbA1c is
measured as a percentage. They calculated the decrease in the participants’
HbA1c levels for each treatment after 1 year.
The researchers found that the average decrease in HbA1c levels after 1 year in
the participants’ blood was:
• 1.4% in the participants who took dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin
• 1.0% in the participants who took glimepiride and metformin
This is shown in the graph below.
