What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants either took 1 of 3 different doses of AZD6615,
or they took a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they
see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
All of the participants took a single dose of study treatment as a tablet by mouth.
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what the participants were taking, but the participants
did not.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment and dose each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
