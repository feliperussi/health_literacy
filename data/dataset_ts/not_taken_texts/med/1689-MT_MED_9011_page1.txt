Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study
drug MEDI3902, and to the participantsâ€™ families. All of the participants helped
researchers learn more about MEDI3902 and help people who are on breathing
machines and are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.
MedImmune sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants and their
families understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
