Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had
might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions the researchers wanted
to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. When a full report of
the study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor
before making any treatment changes.
The results below are for 8,509 out of 8,588 participants who took at least 1 dose of study
treatment and had measurements taken.
Did the participants who took BGF MDI have COPD flare-ups less often?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took either dose of BGF MDI had
COPD flare-ups less often compared with the participants who took GFF MDI or BFF MDI.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of times the participants had
COPD flare-ups during the study that led to the participants needing additional treatment or
hospitalization. Then, they calculated what the rate of COPD flare-ups per year would be for a
participant in each of the BGF groups, compared to the other treatment groups. This comparison
is known as the “risk reduction” and is measured as a percentage.
The researchers found that the participants taking the standard dose of BGF MDI had:
• 24.0% less COPD flare-ups than the participants taking GFF MDI
• 13.0% less COPD flare-ups than the participants taking BFF MDI
The researchers found that the participants taking the low dose of BGF MDI had:
• 25.0% less COPD flare-ups than the participants taking GFF MDI
• 14.0% less COPD flare-ups than the participants taking BFF MDI
