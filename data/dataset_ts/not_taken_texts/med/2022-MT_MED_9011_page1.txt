Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca
Drug Studied: Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
Study Title: A study to learn how sodium zirconium cyclosilicate affects
potassium levels in the blood
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug sodium
zirconium cyclosilicate, also called ZS. You and all of the participants helped researchers
learn more about ZS to help people who have high potassium levels in their blood.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you
understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in March 2017 and ended in February 2018. The study included
267 participants in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and Taiwan.
The study had 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2. The participants who were only in Part 1 were
in the study for up to 10 days. The participants who were in both Part 1 and Part 2 were
in the study for up to 45 days.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with high potassium levels in
their blood. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if ZS works in a number of participants
around the world with high blood potassium levels. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
