7. What were the overall results of the study?
Did the medicines increase the patient’s bone mineral density?
 Your bones are made up of lots of minerals which make them strong. Doctors can
measure the amount of minerals in your bones, also called “bone mineral density”
(BMD), using a special machine called a DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry)
scanner.
 Women taking part in this study had the BMD at their lower spine (also called the
“lumbar spine”), hip and femoral neck (a part of the hip bone) measured at the start
and the end of the study.
 For each woman in the study, researchers calculated how much the BMD at the lower
spine, hip and femoral neck changed between the start of the study (baseline) and the
end of the study (month 12). The size of this change was calculated as a percentage
relative to baseline.
 Researchers then compared the average increase in BMD over 12 months, at the
lower spine, hip and femoral neck, in each treatment group (denosumab and
zoledronic acid).
