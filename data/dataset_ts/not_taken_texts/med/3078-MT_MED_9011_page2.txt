Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have breast cancer.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how AZD9496 works in participants
with a type of tumour called an oestrogen receptor-positive tumour, or ER-positive
tumour. This type of tumour grows in response to the oestrogen hormone in the
body.
The researchers also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
In this study, the researchers compared AZD9496 with a treatment called
fulvestrant. This treatment is used for women with breast cancer who have the
oestrogen receptor on their tumours.
Both AZD9496 and fulvestrant are designed to work by attaching to the oestrogen
receptor on the surface of tumour cells and helping to remove it. Researchers think
this could slow the growth of the tumour.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants getting AZD9496 have fewer oestrogen receptors on their
tumours than the participants getting fulvestrant?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if AZD9496 improves the health of people with ER-positive
breast cancer.
The researchers asked for the help of women with ER-positive breast cancer.
These participants’ tumours did not have a protein called “human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2”, which is found on the surface of some breast cancer cells. This
protein is also called HER2.
Everyone in the study was 52 to 87 years old when they joined and had stopped
getting their monthly periods.
