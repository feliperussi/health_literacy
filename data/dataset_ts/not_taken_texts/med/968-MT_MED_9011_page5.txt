Clinical Study Results
Researchers found that:
• Participants who took dapagliflozin and participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin had a similar average decrease in their BMI. Participants who took
glimepiride had a smaller average decrease in their BMI.
• Participants who took dapagliflozin and participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin had fewer instances of their blood sugar being too low than participants
who took glimepiride.
• Participants who took dapagliflozin and participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin had a similar average decrease in their weight. Participants who took
glimepiride had a smaller average decrease in their weight.
• Compared to the other 2 treatment groups, participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin had the greatest decrease in their blood sugar levels when they took their
treatment without food.
• Participants who took dapagliflozin and participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin had a similar decrease in their risk of needing insulin injections because
of low blood sugar. This decrease in risk was greater for these 2 treatment groups
than for the group that took glimepiride.
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem, so
researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants had during the study.
These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
