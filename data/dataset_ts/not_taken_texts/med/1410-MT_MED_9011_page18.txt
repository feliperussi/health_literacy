Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs in Parts 2 and 3. This
section is a summary of all the adverse events in Parts 2 and 3, whether they might
be related to the study drugs or not. An adverse event is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs
hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the drugs in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
