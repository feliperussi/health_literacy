What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took either dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug
are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
taking. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants took so they
could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took dapagliflozin or the placebo as a tablet by mouth once a
day, for 16 weeks. The dose of dapagliflozin was 10 milligrams, also called mg.
The chart below shows the number of participants in the study and what
treatments they were given. There were 3 participants who joined the study but
did not take any study treatment.
