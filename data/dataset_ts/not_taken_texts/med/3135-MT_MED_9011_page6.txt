What happened during this study?
The study started in February 2018 and ended in March 2019.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time. This part of the study lasted for up to 3 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors
made sure the participants could join the study.
They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood, urine, and saliva samples
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
X took pictures of the participants’ tumors using computed tomography scans, also
known as CT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging scans, also known as MRI
scans
X if needed, took a sample of the participants’ tumors using surgery, also known
as a biopsy
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the
study.
While the participants in Part 1 got study treatment, they visited their
study site:
X 3 times in the first week, then
X once a week or once every 2 weeks, for 18 weeks
At these visits, the study doctors gave the participants their doses of study
treatment and checked their health. If the doctors thought the study treatments
were helping the participants, they could keep getting study treatment for longer.
