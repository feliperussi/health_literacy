What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got AZD9150 and durvalumab. Some
participants also got chemotherapy. This was an “open-label” study. This means
the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each
participant was getting.
This study happened in 2 parts. In Part 1, the participants got AZD9150
and durvalumab through a needle directly into the blood, also known as an
intravenous or “IV” infusion.
Most of the participants in Part 1 also got different types and doses of
chemotherapy, depending on what the study doctors thought was best for each
participant.
In Part 2, the participants got durvalumab as an IV infusion, and AZD9150 either
as an IV infusion or through a needle under the skin, also called an injection.
A computer program was used to randomly choose whether a participant got
AZD9150 as an IV infusion or injection. This helps make sure the groups are
chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment
is as accurate as possible.
