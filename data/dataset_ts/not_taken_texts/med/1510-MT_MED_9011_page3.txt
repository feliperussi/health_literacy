Clinical Study Results
What happened during this study?
The participants in this study were located in 1 of 2 world locations:
• The northern hemisphere – The half of the earth north of the equator. The
equator is an imaginary line around the middle of the earth.
• The southern hemisphere – The half of the earth south of the equator.
The researchers chose participants in these 2 locations because RSV causes
infections mostly during the autumn and winter. These seasons happen at different
times in the 2 hemispheres. The researchers wanted to learn how the study drug
worked in both places.
The participants in the northern hemisphere were in this study for up to about
11 months.
The participants in the southern hemisphere were in this study for up to about
8 months.
Some of the participants left this study before it was completed.
To see if the participants could join this study, the doctors did a physical
examination, including checking the height, weight, and the oxygen level in the
blood of the participants. The doctors also asked about the medical history of the
participants, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
During this study, there were 2 treatments given once during the second visit:
• 946 participants got a MEDI7510 injection and a flu vaccine injection
• 948 participants got a placebo injection and a flu vaccine injection
The participants went back to their study site 3 more times after the second visit.
The participants who developed a respiratory illness went back approximately
twice for each illness.
Throughout this study, the doctors continued to check the overall health of the
participants and ask how they were feeling. Once a month, the doctors also called
the participants to ask questions about their health.
After this study ended, the doctors called the participants to tell them whether they had
gotten MEDI7510 or the placebo, and to ask the participants about their health again.
