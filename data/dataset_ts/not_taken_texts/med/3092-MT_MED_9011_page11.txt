Did durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab help the
participants live longer than standard treatment?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab
and the higher dose of tremelimumab lived longer compared with the
participants who got standard treatment.
To answer this question, the researchers counted how many months the
participants lived with their cancer after starting trial treatment. They calculated
the average number of months for each group.
The average number of months that the participants lived after starting trial
treatment was:
X 16.4 months for the participants who got durvalumab and the higher
dose of tremelimumab
X 13.8 months for the participants who got the standard treatment
