How much of acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when
given as a capsule or as a tablet?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the
participants throughout the study.
In these samples, the study doctors measured:
X the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during the study
X the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during the study
Then, the researchers compared the results when the participants got
acalabrutinib as a tablet mixed in water during Treatment 1 with when they got it
as a capsule mixed in flat Coca-Cola during Treatment 2.
Overall, the researchers found that both the average total and average highest
amounts of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were similar when the
participants got Treatment 1 and Treatment 2.
