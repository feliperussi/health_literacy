Clinical Study Results
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site 4 more times for
follow-up visits over the course of about 2 weeks. During these visits, the doctors
checked the health of the participants again. The doctors asked how the participants
were feeling and what medicines they were taking.
The graphic below shows how the study was done.

What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from the study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

What medical problems did participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
