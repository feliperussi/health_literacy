There are many different types of breast cancer. Breast cancers with high levels
of a protein called HER2 are called “HER2-positive”. In HER2-positive cancer,
HER2 causes the cancer cells to grow quickly. Breast cancers with normal levels
of HER2 are called “HER2-ve”. Drugs have been designed to treat HER2-
positive breast cancer, but researchers are looking for better ways to treat HER2-
ve breast cancer.
Tumor cells are normally able to fix their own DNA when it gets damaged, which
lets them stay alive and grow. The trial drug, olaparib, was designed to kill tumor
cells by stopping them from fixing their damaged DNA. Other trials have shown
that olaparib worked well for the trial participants who had advanced HER2-ve
breast cancer and changes in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. A change in a
gene is also called a “mutation”.
In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out more about how olaparib works
and how safe it is.
What was the purpose of this trial?
This was a “Phase 3” trial. In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if
olaparib worked in a large number of participants with advanced breast cancer.
They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during
the trial.
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this trial were:
X How long did the participants live without their cancer becoming worse
after they started taking olaparib?
X How long did the participants live after they started taking olaparib?
X What medical problems did the doctors report as possibly related to the
trial treatment?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other trials can be
done to find out if olaparib helps improve the health of people with advanced
breast cancer.
