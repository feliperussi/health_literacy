Clinical Trial Results
How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
needs hospitalization. One participant in this study died from a heart attack. Study doctors did not
think the heart attack was related to study treatment.
In this study, 3.8% of participants, or 5 of 132 participants, had serious medical problems:
• Worsening of COPD in 1 participant while taking the placebo
• Multiple injuries in 1 participant while taking 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler
• Blocked artery in 1 participant while taking 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler
• Heart attack in 1 participant while taking 12 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer
• Lung cancer in 1 participant while taking 40 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer
Study doctors did not think any of the serious medical problems were related to study treatment.
What were the most common non-serious medical problems in the study?
Headache was the most common medical problem in the study. The table below shows the most
common medical problems that happened in 2 or more participants in any treatment group during
