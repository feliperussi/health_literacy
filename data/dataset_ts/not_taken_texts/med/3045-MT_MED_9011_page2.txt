Clinical Study Results
Researchers already did studies that showed how the MEDI3250 vaccine worked. In this
study, the researchers wanted to find out more about how MEDI3250 acted in children
who got 1 of 3 different types of the MEDI3250 vaccine.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Which vaccine increased antibodies to each flu strain the most?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of 200 healthy
young male and female children. The children in this study were between 23 and
48 months old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants, doctors, or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting. Some studies are
done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect
the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which
vaccine each participant got so they could create a report of the study results.
The participants in this study got 1 of 3 different types of MEDI3250 vaccine. Each type o f
the MEDI3250 vaccine had different strains of the flu virus in it.
