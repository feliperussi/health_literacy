Clinical Study Results
What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the study results.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors recorded the results of the participants’
tests and measurements that were done throughout the study. The researchers
looked at the results for each part of the study.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the results of
these tests and measurements. But, they did not consider these changes to be
meaningful.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do
not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. This section is
a summary of all the adverse events, whether or not they might be related to
the study treatments. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
