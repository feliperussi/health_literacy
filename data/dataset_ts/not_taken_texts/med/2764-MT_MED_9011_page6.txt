Clinical Trial RESULTS
The figure below shows the median time RDEA3170 took to reach the highest amount in the blood and
the highest amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood after a single 12 mg dose of RDEA3170 and after
multiple 12 mg doses of RDEA3170.

How did RDEA3170 act in the body when taken with and without food?
In Part 3 of the study, researchers took blood samples on Days 1 and 8 about 30 minutes before
participants took RDEA3170. Then, researchers took more blood samples every few hours for 3 days.
Researchers compared what happened when participants took the same 6 mg dose of RDEA3170 with and
without food. The amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood was the same in both groups, but it took
longer for RDEA3170 to reach the highest amount after eating a high-fat, high-calorie meal.
The figure below shows the median time RDEA3170 took to reach the highest amount in the blood and
the highest amount of RDEA3170 in participants’ blood after fasting and after eating a high-fat, high-
calorie meal.
