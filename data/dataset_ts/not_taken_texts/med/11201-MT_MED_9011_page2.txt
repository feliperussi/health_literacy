Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much AZD5718 got into the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if AZD5718 helps improve the health of people with heart disease.
What treatments did the participants take?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
In this study, all of the participants took AZD5718 as tablets by mouth. The doses of
AZD5718 were:
• Dose 1 - low
• Dose 2 - medium
• Dose 3 - high
There were 6 different groups of participants in the study. Each group took each of the 3 doses in
a different order.
A computer programme was used to randomly choose the order in which each group of
participants took these doses. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants stayed overnight at their study site for a total of 12 days. During this time, they
took 3 single doses of AZD5718. The chart below shows when they took these doses:
