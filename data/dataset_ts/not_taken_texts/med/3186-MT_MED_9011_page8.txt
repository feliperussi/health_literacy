Did the participants feel their quality of life changed after taking BGF MDI?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took either dose of BGF MDI felt
that it helped their quality of life compared to those who took GFF MDI or BFF MDI.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to answer 2 questionnaires
about their COPD symptoms and quality of life:
• St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, also called SGRQ
• Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool, also called EXACT
For each questionnaire, the study doctors calculated scores from 0 to 100 based on the
participants’ responses. The higher the score, the more a participant’s COPD symptoms were
affecting their quality of life.
