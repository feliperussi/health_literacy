Did the participants feel that durvalumab and the higher dose of
tremelimumab affected their symptoms and quality of life compared
with standard treatment?
To answer this question, the trial doctors asked the participants to complete 2
different questionnaires. These were:
X The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
Life Questionnaire – Core 30, also known as EORTC QLQ-C30
X The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality
of Life Questionnaire – Hepatocellular Carcinoma 18, also known as EORTC
QLQ-HCC18
The researchers gave the participants a “score” based on their answers to
each questionnaire about the severity of their symptoms or quality of life. The
researchers measured how much the participants’ scores changed during the
trial. Then, they compared the scores of the participants who got durvalumab
and the higher dose of tremelimumab to those who got standard treatment.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire showed that:
X The participants who got durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab
had a meaningful improvement in quality of life, ability to do daily tasks,
appetite, fatigue levels, and nausea compared with those who got standard
treatment.
The EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaire showed that:
X The participants who got durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab
had less shoulder pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal swelling than those
who got standard treatment.
