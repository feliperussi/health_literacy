Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical problems
are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life
threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had a serious adverse reaction.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
None of the participants had an adverse reaction.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how much air the participants with asthma could breathe
out after taking different doses of AS MDI.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and
are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may
provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AS MDI are planned.
