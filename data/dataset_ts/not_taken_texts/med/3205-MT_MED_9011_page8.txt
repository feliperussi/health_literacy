Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ calorie intake?
Yes. To answer this question, the study doctors kept track of how many calories
the participants took in during lunch throughout Part 2. The study doctors focused
on these results at the start of Part 2, about 2 weeks into Part 2, and at the end
of Part 2.
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who were given MEDI0382 in
Part 2 had a larger decrease in their calorie intake compared to the participants
who were given the placebo.
