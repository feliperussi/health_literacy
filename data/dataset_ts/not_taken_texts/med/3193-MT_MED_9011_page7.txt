What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got benralizumab and their regular oral
corticosteroid treatments for asthma.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The participants got benralizumab through a needle under the skin, also called an
injection. The dose was measured in milligrams, also known as “mg”.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
