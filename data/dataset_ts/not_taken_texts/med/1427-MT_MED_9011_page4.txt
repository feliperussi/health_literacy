Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with cancer of the bladder or urinary
system that had spread and could not be removed by surgery. The men and
women in this study were 32 to 89 years old when they joined.
The participants had not had chemotherapy before they joined the study. They
had at least 1 tumor measuring at least 1 centimeter, which is just under half
an inch. They were able to do at least some light physical activity or work. The
participants who joined the study were expected to live for at least 12 more weeks
at the time that they joined.
The study included 1,032 participants in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, South Korea, Spain,
Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer of the bladder or urinary
system that has spread and cannot be removed by surgery. Cancer of the bladder
or urinary system is also called urothelial cancer. Before a drug can be approved
for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how
it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. When cancer progresses to a late stage, tumors spread to
other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started. Sometimes
there are too many tumors or they are too difficult to remove by surgery.
Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing. But in people
with urothelial cancer, the proteins on the tumor cells can interact with certain
proteins on the immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from recognizing
the tumor cells and being able to attack them.
