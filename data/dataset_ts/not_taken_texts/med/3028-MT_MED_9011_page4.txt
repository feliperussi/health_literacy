Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with ES-SCLC. The
participants in this study were 28 to 88 years old when they joined. All of the
participants had tumors that were large enough to measure using CT or MRI
scans. Most of the participants were current or previous smokers.
Overall, the study included participants in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria,
China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan,
Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.
Most of the participants in the study from China and Taiwan joined the study later
than the participants in the rest of the world. This group of participants is known as
the China Part. The results for these participants are in a different summary.
The main report this summary is based on is for 805 participants in the rest of the
world, including 6 participants in China and Taiwan. This group of participants is
known as the Global Part.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with ES-SCLC. Before a
drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how durvalumab alone or
together with tremelimumab, with chemotherapy, worked in a large number of
participants with ES-SCLC. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra
cells can form tumors. When cancer progresses to a late stage, tumors spread to
other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started. Sometimes
there are too many tumors or they are too difficult to remove by surgery.
