Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the same amounts of drugs from the dapagliflozin/metformin tablets made in the mainland
United States get into participants’ blood as the tablets made in Puerto Rico?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the study was 18
to 50 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means that the researchers and the participant knew what
the participant was taking.
This study had 4 parts. Each participant was only in 1 of these parts. In each part, 72 participants
took dapagliflozin/metformin tablets. Doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
In Parts 1 and 2, the participants took tablets that had 5 mg of dapagliflozin and 500 mg of
metformin. These tablets are called 5/500 mg tablets.
In Parts 3 and 4, the participants took tablets that had 10 mg of dapagliflozin and 1,000 mg of
metformin. These tablets are called 10/1,000 mg tablets.
In each part, the participants took 1 tablet that was made in the mainland United States, and
1 tablet that was made in Puerto Rico. But the participants took these in a different order.
In Parts 1 and 3, the participants took the tablets with food. In Parts 2 and 4, they took the tablets
without food.
The table below shows a summary of the different parts.
Part Amount of drug With or without food
1 5/500 mg With food
2 5/500 mg Without food
3 10/1,000 mg With food
4 10/1,000 mg Without food
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that each participant took the
treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
