Did the participants feel that cediranib and olaparib helped their
overall well-being?
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete
2 different questionnaires about their health and well-being throughout the
study. This is also known as an assessment of the participants’ quality of life.
The questionnaires used were the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30, also called the EORTC
QLQ-C30, and the EORTC QLQ-OV-28 for ovarian cancer.
The questionnaires asked the participants to rate how their symptoms affected
their health and well-being in different ways. Each participant’s “score” was
calculated based on their responses. The researchers then compared the scores
before and after the participants took the study treatment, throughout the study.
Overall, the participants did not find that taking cediranib and olaparib helped
their well-being.
