Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what participants
were taking, but the participants did not.
In this study, participants took different doses of AZD8871 or a placebo in an inhaler.
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the
drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make sure the
participants could join the study. They also took blood and urine samples and checked
the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG.
Throughout the study, the doctors continued checking the health of the participants and
taking more blood and urine samples.
After this first visit, participants stayed at their study site for about 3 weeks. During this
visit, participants took several doses of either AZD8871 or the placebo in an inhaler.
Three different AZD8871 dose amounts were used in the study.
About 1 week after the participants went home, they visited their study site for a follow
up examination. Then, they visited their study site again a few days later for a final
follow-up examination.
