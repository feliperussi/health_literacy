What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment change.

How much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood?
The researchers wanted to find out how much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood
when it was taken in different forms in the same amount. To do this, the researchers
measured how much ticagrelor was in the blood at different times during the study.
The body breaks down ticagrelor into a substance called a metabolite. This metabolite
also acts like ticagrelor in the body. So, the researchers also measured how much of the
metabolite was in the blood at different times during the study.
The amount of ticagrelor and the metabolite was measured in hours times nanograms
per milliliter of blood, also known as h•ng/mL.
