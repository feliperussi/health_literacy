Clinical Study Results
The researchers also measured the overall amount of durvalumab in the participants’
blood over the 4 weeks after their first dose. This was measured in days multiplied by
μg/mL, also called day•μg/mL. The amounts of durvalumab in the blood were about
the same whether durvalumab was given alone or with tremelimumab. For durvalumab
alone, the amount was 4,250 day•μg/mL. For durvalumab given with tremelimumab, the
amount was 4,060 day•μg/mL.
How did tremelimumab act in the blood when given with durvalumab?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the level of tremelimumab in the
participants’ blood after their first dose and at steady state. The researchers found that
the highest level of tremelimumab in the blood after the first dose was about the same as
the amount at steady state. The level of tremelimumab in the blood just before the next
dose was higher at steady state than after the first dose.

The researchers also measured the overall amount of tremelimumab in the participants’
blood over the 4 weeks after their first dose, which was 174 day•μg/mL.
What medical problems did the participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical problems
are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is
life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
