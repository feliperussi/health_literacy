Why was the research needed?
The flu is a virus that can cause a lot of medical problems, including fever and muscle
aches. There are many different types of flu viruses, but this study focused on 2 types .
Each type of virus has 2 different groups of strains.
• Type A virus: A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains
• Type B virus: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria strains
The vaccine in this study, called MEDI3250, was made to defend the body against
different strains of the flu virus. The MEDI3250 vaccine has weak versions of certain
strains of the flu virus in it. Vaccines cause the body to make antibodies.A ntibodies are
proteins in the body that fight infection and help prevent disease in the future.
