Clinical Study Results
The researchers in this study wanted to learn how AZD5718 affects people with CAD who are
also taking rosuvastatin. To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the
help of healthy volunteers.
The main question researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• How did rosuvastatin act in the body when taken alone compared to when taken
with AZD5718?
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the study doctors and the participants knew what
the participants were taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the
results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
There were 5 drug doses in this study. Each participant took all 5 doses, but in a different
order. The participants in this study visited their study site 7 times.
Before the study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make sure the participants
could join the study. They also checked their heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG. The doctors also asked about participants’ medical history, how they were
feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
The study doses are listed below. The doses were taken either in pill form or in liquid form by
mouth. Some doses were taken with food, and some doses were taken without food:
• Dose 1: rosuvastatin alone
• Dose 2: rosuvastatin combined with AZD5718
• Dose 3: AZD5718 only
• Dose 4: AZD5718 only
• Dose 5: AZD5718 only
There was a “washout period” of 7 days in between the 5 treatment periods. During the
washout period, participants were not allowed to take certain medications. This means that
their bodies had processed all of the medications in their blood, and the medications were
“washed out” of their bodies.
