What happened during the study?
The study started in March 2020 and ended in September 2020. The participants
were in the study for about 10 weeks. After the study started, it was paused due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, there was a delay of about 4 months between the
study starting and the participants taking any study treatment.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This part of the study lasted for 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors
checked the participants’ health to make sure they could join the study. The study
doctors:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
> took blood and urine samples
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements during the study visits.
