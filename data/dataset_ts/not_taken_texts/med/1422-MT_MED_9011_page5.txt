Clinical Study Results
For Group 1, the researchers were not able to get as many participants to join the study
as they had originally planned for. Because of this, the researchers did not think there
were enough participants in Group 1 to determine if the study results for this group
were meaningful. So, for the first question below, the researchers only studied the
results from Group 2.
For Group 2, the researchers were not able to gather all of the study results for 2 of
the 20 participants. So, the researchers could only study some of the results below
for 18 out of the 20 participants in Group 2.
Did the tumors of the participants in Group 2 shrink after getting
durvalumab and AZD5069?
No. Overall, the participants in Group 2 did not have their tumors shrink after getting
durvalumab and AZD5069.
To answer this question, the researchers studied participants’ tumors throughout the
study. They did this by measuring the size of the tumors, using CT scans and MRIs to
scan the tumors, and taking tissue samples from the tumors.
For Group 2, the researchers found that 5.6% of the participants had their tumors
shrink. This was 1 out of 18 participants. After about 18 weeks, this participant’s tumor
started to grow again.
The figure below shows these results.
