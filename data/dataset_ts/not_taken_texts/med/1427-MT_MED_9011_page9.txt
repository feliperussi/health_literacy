Did MEDI4736 with tremelimumab help the participants live longer than
chemotherapy?
Overall, the researchers found that the difference between the participants who
got MEDI4736 with tremelimumab and those who got chemotherapy was small. It
was too small for the researchers to know if MEDI4736 with tremelimumab helped
the participants live longer.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of months the
participants lived with their cancer after getting study treatment. They calculated
the median number of months for each group. A median is the middle number in
a set of numbers. It is between the lowest and highest numbers.
The median number of months that the participants lived for after study treatment
was:
> 15.1 months for the participants who got MEDI4736 with tremelimumab
> 12.1 months for the participants who got chemotherapy
