Who took part in this study?
.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid
tumors, including small-cell lung cancer. The participants had already tried other
treatments for their cancer, but it was still getting worse. The participants in this
study were 38 to 81 years old when they joined.
The study included 72 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before a
drug can be approved for people to use, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
These cells can form tumors. When a tumor starts in an organ of the body, it
is known as a solid tumor. An “advanced” tumor usually means that it keeps
growing despite treatment.
Treatments for cancer do not help everybody. So, researchers are looking for new
ways to treat cancer. The study drug, AZD2811, was designed to be toxic to tumor
cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD2811 in
participants with advanced solid tumors.
