Did MEDI4736 alone help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live
longer than chemotherapy?
The researchers wanted to know how MEDI4736 alone affected participants with
a certain type of urothelial cancer called PD-L1 high. This is because people with
this type of cancer have a large amount of the PD-L1 protein on their tumor cells.
There were 209 participants who got MEDI4736 and 207 participants who got
chemotherapy who had PD-L1 high cancer.
Overall, the researchers found that in the participants with PD-L1 high cancer,
the difference between those who got MEDI4736 alone and those who got
chemotherapy was small. It was too small for the researchers to know if MEDI4736
alone helped these participants live longer.
To answer this question, the researchers counted how many months the
participants lived with their cancer after getting study treatment. They calculated
the median number of months for each group.
The median number of months that the participants with PD-L1 high cancer lived
for after study treatment was:
> 14.4 months for the participants who got MEDI4736 alone
> 12.1 months for the participants who got chemotherapy
Did the participants getting MEDI4736 alone or with tremelimumab
have less severe symptoms?
The researchers found that the participants getting MEDI4736 alone had less
severe symptoms during treatment compared with those getting chemotherapy.
They found that the participants getting MEDI4736 with tremelimumab did not
have a change in symptoms compared with those getting chemotherapy.
