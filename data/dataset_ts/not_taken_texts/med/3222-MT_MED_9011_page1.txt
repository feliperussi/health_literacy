Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
selumetinib. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how
different forms of selumetinib are taken up by the body in healthy participants.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of
the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their
important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
