Clinical Study Results
Researchers measure HbA1c by using a percentage. In this study, the researchers calculated
the change in the participants’ HbA1c after 14 weeks of treatment. This is also called the LS
mean method. In this study, the LS mean method helped the researchers accurately measure
the change in the participants’ blood sugar levels and weight.
The researchers compared the results for the participants who got MEDI0382 to the results for
the participants who got the placebo. The results for the participants who got liraglutide are also
presented below, but those results were not the main focus of the study.
Overall, the researchers found that after 14 weeks of treatment:
• The participants who got 100 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their blood sugar
levels of 1.01%.
• The participants who got 200 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their blood sugar
levels of 1.22%.
• The participants who got 300 μg of MEDI0382 had an LS mean decrease in their blood sugar
levels of 1.09%.
• The participants who got 1.8 mg of liraglutide had an LS mean decrease in their blood sugar
levels of 1.22%.
• The participants who got the placebo had an LS mean decrease in their blood sugar levels
of 0.18%.
The figure below shows these results.
