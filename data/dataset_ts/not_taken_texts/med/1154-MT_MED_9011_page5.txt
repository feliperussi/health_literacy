Clinical Trial RESULTS
Did more participants have other vaccine side effects within 7 days of getting
the 3 strain vaccine, compared to the placebo?
Yes. Overall, more participants who got the 3 strain vaccine reported tiredness,
runny nose, muscle aches, sore throat, and headache, compared to those who
got the placebo. The frequency of these side effects is comparable with those
seen in previous experiments and is thought to be a sign of the body making
a protective response. The body protects itself by creating antibodies, which
are formed to fight these types of side effects.
The table below shows how many participants had at least 1 flu symptom.
