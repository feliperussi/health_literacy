Clinical Trial RESULTS
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in January 2016 and ended in April 2016. It included 15 men
at one study site in the United Kingdom. All of you were healthy and between
the ages of 18 and 55. When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data
and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be given to patients, the company developing the
treatment must do research studies to show that it is safe and effective. The first
step in studying a new drug in people is to test it in healthy people, or people
without any serious health problems. The study drug, AZD7986, is currently
being developed to treat COPD.
Researchers in your study tested AZD7986 in combination with two approved
drugs, verapamil and itraconazole.
Verapamil is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain, and
certain heart rhythm disorders. It works by relaxing the muscles of your heart
and blood vessels. Itraconazole is a medication that fights infections caused
by fungus, which can affect any part of the body including the lungs, mouth,
throat, toenails, or fingernails.
In this study, researchers wanted to know how the body absorbs, breaks down,
and removes AZD7986 when taken in combination with the two approved
drugs. The main questions researchers asked in your study were:
• How did AZD7986 act in the body when taken by itself versus when taken
with other drugs?
• What medical problems did participants have after they took AZD7986?
What kind of study was this?
This study was an “open label” study. This means that both the participants and
the study staff knew what study drugs each participant took. All 15 participants
were put into one group throughout the entire study.
