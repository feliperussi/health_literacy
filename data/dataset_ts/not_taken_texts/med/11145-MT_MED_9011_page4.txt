Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men with prostate cancer.
The participants in this study were 53 to 90 years old when they joined. The study
included 59 men in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat prostate cancer. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to receive, researchers do clinical studies to
find out if it works and how safe it is.
In people with prostate cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of
abnormal prostate cells. These extra cells can form tumors in the prostate gland
that can spread to other parts of the body.
The participants in this study had received other standard types of treatments for
prostate cancer before the study started. But, these treatments were no longer
working for them, and other treatment options that work in different ways were
needed.
The body’s immune system can help attack cancer cells. But, sometimes tumors
decrease the immune system’s activity. This is called “immune suppression”.
Stopping immune suppression can allow the immune system to help attack tumor
cells again. AZD4635 was designed to stop the immune suppression caused by
tumors.
AZD4635 may work better when it is combined with other types of treatments like
durvalumab and oleclumab. Both durvalumab and oleclumab were designed to
boost the immune system’s activity and ability to attack cancer cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD4635 with durvalumab or
oleclumab worked in a small number of participants with prostate cancer. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
