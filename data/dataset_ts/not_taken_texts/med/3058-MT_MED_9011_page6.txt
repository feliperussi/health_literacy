What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know if a drug causes a medical problem. So
when researchers study new drugs, they keep track of all the medical problems
that participants have during the study. These problems are called “adverse
events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
During this study, 5 out of the 28 participants (17.9%) had at least 1 medical
problem after taking Dose A. None of the participants had medical problems
after taking Dose B. None of the participants left the study because of medical
problems.
