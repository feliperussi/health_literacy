Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The doses of MEDI3902 were measured in milligrams, also called mg. The chart
below shows the treatments the participants got. Of the 188 participants in this
study, there were 4 participants who did not receive treatment. This was because
they did not meet the study guidelines or the study doctors accidentally found out
the treatment given to them. So, the below treatment groups show 184 of the 188
participants.

The participants were in this study for up to about 8 weeks. But, the entire
study took over 3 years to finish. The study started in March 2016 and ended in
December 2019.
Before the participants got treatment, the study doctors visited them 2 times
over the course of about 1 week. During this time, the study doctors checked to
make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants’ vital signs
• took blood samples
• checked to confirm that the participants had harmful bacteria in their body, but had not
developed pneumonia
• asked the participants or their legal guardians about the participants’ medical history,
how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking
