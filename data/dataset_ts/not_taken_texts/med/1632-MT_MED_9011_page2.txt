Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew what
the participant was taking.
All participants in this study took fexofenadine and osimertinib. Both of the drugs were taken
by mouth in tablet form.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the study doctors did a physical examination to make sure
participants could join the study. They also took blood and urine samples and checked the
participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram also known as an ECG.
This study had 2 parts. All participants were in both parts.
Part 1 lasted 4 days, and all the participants visited their study site 5 times. They visited
once on the day before Part 1 began, and then once each day during the 4-day period
of Part 1. They took 1 dose of fexofenadine alone at their first visit. Then, study doctors
checked the health of participants at each of the next 4 visits.
Part 2 lasted 42 days, and all the participants visited their study site 12 times. They
took doses of osimertinib alone and both drugs together during these visits. Study doctors
checked the health of participants during these 12 visits.
About 1 month after Part 2 ended, participants visited their study site once for a follow-up
examination.
