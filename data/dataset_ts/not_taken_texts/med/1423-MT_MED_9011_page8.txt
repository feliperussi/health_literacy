Clinical Study Results
Hazard ratio
For the hazard ratio, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab and
tremelimumab together were 15% less likely to die during the study compared to the participants
who got SOC treatment. But, the researchers did not consider this 15% difference between the
2 groups to be statistically significant.
How likely it was that the participants would be alive 2 years after starting the study
The researchers found that:
• There was a 35.4% chance that the participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab
together would still be alive 2 years after starting the study.
• There was a 22.7% chance that the participants who got SOC treatment would still be alive 2
years after starting the study.
The figure below shows these results.
