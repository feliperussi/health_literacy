The most common serious adverse events were a high fever and severe inflammation because
of an infection, also called cytokine release syndrome.
The most common adverse events were high fever and fatigue.
Dose-limiting toxicities
The study doctors also counted the number of dose-limiting toxicities the participants had during
the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is also called a DLT. A DLT is an adverse event that is severe
enough to stop the study team from increasing the dose of study treatment.
There were 3 participants who had a DLT during this study:
• 1 participant who received 0.037 mg MEDI9197 had a DLT. This happened in Group 1 in Part 1 of
the study. This DLT was due to high fever and severe inflammation because of an infection called
cytokine release syndrome.
• 1 participant who received 0.055 mg MEDI9197 had a DLT. This happened in Group 5 in Part 1 of
the study. This DLT was due to cytokine release syndrome, which resulted in severe inflammation
because of an infection. Because of this DLT, the researchers decided not to give this dose to any
more participants in Part 1.
• 1 participant who received 0.012 mg MEDI9197 and 1500 mg of durvalumab had a DLT. This
happened in Group 9 in Part 3 of the study. This DLT was due to heavy bleeding and caused the
body to shut down due to a lack of oxygen. This participant died as a result of this DLT.
