Why was the research needed?
Researchers in this study wanted to find a new way of treating sickle cell disease.
This disease causes pain when red blood cells get stuck in small blood vessels in your
body. Normally, red blood cells are flexible and round and can move through your
blood vessels easily to deliver oxygen to organs in your body. But if you have sickle
cell disease, your red blood cells are curved and stiff. These abnormal red blood cells
are called “sickle cells”. When they get stuck, they slow down or block the flow of
blood. This causes pain and can damage your organs and tissues.
The study drug, ticagrelor, is being tested for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
Researchers wanted to learn if taking ticagrelor could ease the pain in people with
sickle cell disease. Another type of blood cell, called a “platelet”, can get stuck along
with sickle cells. Ticagrelor may make this happen less. In this study, researchers
want to know if two different doses of ticagrelor could reduce the number of days
with pain in participants with sickle cell disease more than a placebo. A placebo
looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine. Researchers use placebos
to compare the results for participants who take study drugs with the results for
participants who take no medicine at all.
