Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma that is not
controlled well with treatments that are already available. Before a drug can be
approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is
and how it works.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did benralizumab reduce the estimated number of asthma attacks that
the participants would have experienced over 1 year?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab reduced the estimated
number of asthma attacks that the participants would have experienced over 1
year compared with the placebo.
X Did the participants feel that benralizumab helped their health-related
quality of life and helped them control their asthma symptoms?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got benralizumab
felt that it helped their health-related quality of life and helped them control
their asthma symptoms compared with the participants who got the placebo.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 14.0% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most
common medical problem was headache.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
