Clinical Trial Results
During the study, study doctors did a physical examination by checking your height,
weight, and temperature again. Study doctors took more blood and urine samples
and checked your heart health using an ECG. Study doctors also checked your skin for
AD symptoms and asked about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what
medicines you were taking. Study doctors checked how you were feeling 6 weeks and
then 12 weeks after your last treatment. They asked you what other medicines you were
taking, if you had any new medical problems, and what your symptoms were like.
During the follow-up period, study doctors used the same scoring system to look at
how severe participantsâ€™ AD symptoms were. This period lasted 22 weeks. Study doctors
asked if you had any new medical problems and what your symptoms were like.
