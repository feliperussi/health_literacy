The researchers in this study wanted to learn more about acalabrutinib and its
metabolite in healthy participants and whether acalabrutinib as a tablet was
affected by stomach acid. A metabolite is a substance that the body makes when
it breaks down a drug. The body removes metabolites through fluids, such as
urine or sweat.
In this study, the researchers wanted to compare how much acalabrutinib got into
the blood:
X when given as a capsule or as a tablet
X when given as a tablet with and without a proton-pump inhibitor called
rabeprazole
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How much of acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when given
as a capsule or as a tablet?
X Did rabeprazole affect how much of acalabrutinib given as a tablet and its
metabolite got into the blood?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The researchers wanted to learn the answers to these questions before doing
other studies to learn if acalabrutinib could help people who have COVID-19.
This study was planned to have 2 parts. When Part 1 ended, there was information
available from other studies in patients with COVID-19. This information showed
that acalabrutinib did not help those patients. So, the researchers did not continue
to Part 2 of the study.
