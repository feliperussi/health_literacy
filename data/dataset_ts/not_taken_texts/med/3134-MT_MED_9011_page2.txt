Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a drug
can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got tezepelumab or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
The participants in this study had been taking asthma treatments called oral
corticosteroids before they joined the study. Oral corticosteroids are also known
as “OCS”.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did tezepelumab reduce the amount of OCS needed to control
asthma symptoms?
Overall, the researchers found that the percentage of participants who
could reduce their OCS dose was similar in the tezepelumab group and in
the placebo group. The difference between the groups was too small for
the researchers to know if tezepelumab could reduce the amount of OCS
needed to control asthma symptoms better than the placebo.
> Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped their quality of life
or helped them to control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got
tezepelumab felt that study treatment helped their quality of life and their
asthma more than those who got the placebo.
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 4.7% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This
was 7 out of 150 participants.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
