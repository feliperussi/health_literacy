Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did fewer participants who took ticagrelor have a stroke or die within 30 days of
taking study treatment?
• What serious medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know to find out if ticagrelor helps
improve the health of people who are at increased risk of having strokes.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either ticagrelor or a placebo. A placebo looks like
a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make
sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused
by the drug. All of the participants also took an existing treatment for strokes called
acetylsalicylic acid in addition to ticagrelor or the placebo. Acetylsalicylic acid is also
called ASA.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study
doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking. Some
studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking
can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out
which treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took ticagrelor and ASA or the placebo and ASA as tablets by mouth for
30 days. The doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg. The participants’ dose
of ASA was either based on the participants’ normal dose if they were already taking ASA
before the study, or based on what the study doctor recommended for each participant.
