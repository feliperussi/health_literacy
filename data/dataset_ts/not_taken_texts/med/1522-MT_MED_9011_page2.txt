Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with advanced solid tumors.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if tremelimumab works in a small
number of participants with advanced solid tumors. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. An “advanced”
solid tumor usually means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
Researchers have found that sometimes, the body’s own immune system may control
tumor growth by killing cancer cells. Some treatments may help the immune system to
slow down or stop tumor growth. The study drug, tremelimumab, was designed to work
in this way.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how tremelimumab affected participants
with advanced cancer of the bladder, breast, or pancreas. There are currently not many
treatment options for people with these types of advanced solid tumors. A treatment
called durvalumab is being developed to treat solid tumors that also works on the
immune system, but in different way than tremelimumab.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did any participants have their tumors shrink enough after getting tremelimumab?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and
women with advanced cancer of the bladder, breast, or pancreas. There were 32
participants who had bladder cancer and 20 participants who had pancreatic cancer.
There were 12 participants who had a type of breast cancer known as “triple negative”
breast cancer. The participants in this study were 41 to 85 years old when they joined.
