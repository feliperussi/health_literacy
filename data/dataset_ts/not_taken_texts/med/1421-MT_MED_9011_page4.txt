Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did durvalumab help participants’ tumors shrink or disappear when the drug
was given either alone or given together with tremelimumab?
The researchers wanted to learn if durvalumab and tremelimumab help participants with
pancreatic cancer. A small number of participants in both treatment groups had their tumors
shrink, but researchers could not tell if these changes were related to the study drugs.
