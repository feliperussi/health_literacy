Clinical Study Results
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had during the
study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An adverse
event is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or
the participant needs hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the
treatments in the study.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
