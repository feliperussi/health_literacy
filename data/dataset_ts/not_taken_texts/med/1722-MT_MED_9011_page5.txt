How did MEDI6012 affect the amount of good cholesterol in the blood?
The researchers found that MEDI6012 increased the amount of good cholesterol in the
participantsâ€™ blood.
The researchers measured the amount of good cholesterol in the blood before treatment,
during treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after treatment. They also measured the
amount of other substances that play a role in removing bad cholesterol from the blood.
To find out how MEDI6012 affected the amount of these substances in the blood, the
researchers focused mainly on the amount in the blood during the 4 days after the last
dose compared with the amount in the blood before treatment.
They found that the amounts of these substances increased in the participants who got
MEDI6012 in a 1-hour IV infusion compared with the participants who got a placebo. The
differences between the lowest dose of MEDI6012 and the placebo were too small in some
cases for the researchers to know whether the 40 mg dose increased the amount of these
substances in the blood compared to the placebo. The 40 mg dose was the lowest dose
tested in this study.
The amounts of these substances also increased in the participants who got MEDI6012
in the IV push.
