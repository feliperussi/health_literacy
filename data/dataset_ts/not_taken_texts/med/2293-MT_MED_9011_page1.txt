What is happening with the study now?
Participants were in the study for up to 68 weeks. But, the entire study took about

study included 815 participants in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Germany,
Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Two participants left the study before they took any medicine. This summary
