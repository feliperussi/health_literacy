Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the adverse events the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These adverse
events are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
Adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
