Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have nasal polyps.
Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
treatment but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did benralizumab shrink the participants’ nasal polyps and reduce how
blocked their nose was?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab reduced the size of the
participants’ nasal polyps and how blocked their nose was.
X Did benralizumab help improve the participants’ nasal polyp symptoms or
their quality of life?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab helped improve the
participants’ nasal polyp symptoms and quality of life.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 10.5% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study treatments during the study.
This was 43 out of 410 participants. The most common medical problems were
having a fever and feeling tired. These medical problems happened in both the
participants who got benralizumab and those who got the placebo.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
