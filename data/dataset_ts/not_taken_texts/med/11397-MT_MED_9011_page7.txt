Did rabeprazole affect how much acalabrutinib and its metabolite got
into the blood?
No. To answer this question, the study doctors measured:
• the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood over
the course of treatment
• the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood
during treatment
The researchers studied these results for the 17 participants who took both
Treatment 1 with rabeprazole and Treatment 2 without rabeprazole. Then, they
compared the results between the treatments.
Overall, the researchers found that the average total and average highest amounts
of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were similar when taken with or
without rabeprazole.
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to acalabrutinib. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital
care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by acalabrutinib. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for acalabrutinib.
There were 4 of the 39 participants who did not take any treatment. So, the results
below are for 35 of the 39 participants.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
