Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
