Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the caregivers of
the participants knew which treatment their child was getting.
The participants got ticagrelor by mouth as a powder mixed with water. The
ticagrelor doses were given in milligrams per kilogram of body weight, also called
mg/kg.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site with
their caregivers 1 time over the course of about 1 week. At this visit, the doctors
checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
called an ECG
• asked the caregivers about their child’s medical history
During the study, the participants and their caregivers visited their study site
1 time to receive the treatment. At this visit, each participant got 1 dose of
ticagrelor. The treatment groups are listed below.
Group Age Treatment given (1 dose)
Group 1 Less than 0.1 mg/kg
(2 participants) 6 months of ticagrelor
Group 2 6 months to less 0.2 mg/kg
(19 participants) than 21 months of ticagrelor
After the participants got study treatment, the participants and their
caregivers visited their study site 1 more time within 1 week. At this visit, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants.
