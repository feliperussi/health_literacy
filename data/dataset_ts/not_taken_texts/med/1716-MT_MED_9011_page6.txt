Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
Part B of the study that the doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions.” An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. The
