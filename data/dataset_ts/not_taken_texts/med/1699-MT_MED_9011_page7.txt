Clinical Trial Results
Researchers found the following:
• After 12 weeks of treatment during the 16-week study, the blood sugar level
of participants without food decreased by an average of 25.1 mg/dL.
• After 24 weeks of treatment during the 28-week study, the blood sugar level
of participants without food decreased by an average of 40.7 mg/dL.
Average change in blood pressure
Researchers also measured the average change in the blood pressure of
participants throughout the study. There are 2 types of blood pressure. Systolic
blood pressure measures the pressure in the bloodstream when the heart is
beating. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the bloodstream when
the heart is resting. Both types are measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg.
This is a way that researchers can measure pressure.
At the end of the study, researchers found that:
• the systolic blood pressure of participants decreased by an average
of 3.35 mmHg
• the diastolic blood pressure of participants decreased by an average
of 0.15 mmHg
Average change in weight
Researchers also measured the average change in the weight of participants
throughout the study. At the end of the study, they found that the weight of
participants decreased by an average of 0.95 kilograms, or kg.
