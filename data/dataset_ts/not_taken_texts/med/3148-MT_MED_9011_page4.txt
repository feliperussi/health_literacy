Which new formulation of AZD5718 acted the most like the AZD5718 tablets
that were tested in previous studies?
The researchers looked at:
• the amount of AZD5718 in the blood overall
• the maximum amount of AZD5718 in the blood at any time
• the amount of AZD5718 in the blood at 24 hours after taking AZD5718
They compared 4 different formulations of AZD5718 with a formulation that had already
been tested in a previous study. Based on what they learned, the researchers chose
1 of the formulations taken as a 200 mg dose for Part 2 of the study.
Did taking AZD5718 with food change the way AZD5718 behaved in
the body?
No. The researchers found that there was no meaningful difference in the amount of
AZD5718 in the blood when the formulation in Part 2 was taken with food.
