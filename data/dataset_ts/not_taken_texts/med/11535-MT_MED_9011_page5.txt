Clinical Study Results
Was the amount of the two US forms of epoetin alfa in the blood similar over time?
Yes. Although there was a small difference in between the two US forms, the difference was so
small that researchers considered them to be the same.
The researchers used the same method to compare the two US forms as they used to compare
the European and US forms of epoetin alfa.
When comparing Form C to Form D, the researchers found that the average amount of epoetin
alfa in the participants’ blood was 114.3% for Form C.

What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
