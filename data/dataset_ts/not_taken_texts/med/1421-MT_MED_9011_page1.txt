Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug studied: Durvalumab
Study title: A study to learn how durvalumab by itself or durvalumab
together with tremelimumab affects patients with
pancreatic cancer
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drugs durvalumab and
tremelimumab. These drugs are being developed to treat patients with pancreatic cancer,
as well as other types of cancer. You and all of the participants are helping researchers
learn how durvalumab by itself and durvalumab together with tremelimumab can be used
to potentially treat pancreatic cancer and if these drugs cause medical problems.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the
study with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP
and a medical writing organization called Synchrogenix helped prepare this summary
of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your
important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to 1 year. But, the entire study took
almost a year and a half to finish.
The study started in November 2015 and ended in March 2017. The study included 65
participants at 21 study sites in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain,
and the United States.
The study had 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part B did not enroll any participants because
researchers did not think the results for Part A were good enough to proceed to Part B.
So, the study ended after Part A was completed. The sponsor reviewed the data collected
in the study and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
