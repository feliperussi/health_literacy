X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
Medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the
treatments the participants got during the study are called “adverse reactions”.
• There were 60.3% of participants who got durvalumab with tremelimumab
who had adverse reactions during the study. This was 246 out of 408
participants.
• There were 45.5% of participants who got durvalumab alone who had
adverse reactions during the study. This was 92 out of 202 participants.
• There were 93.9% of participants who got standard treatment who had an
adverse reaction during this study. This was 184 out of 196 participants.
The most common adverse reaction was a rash.
