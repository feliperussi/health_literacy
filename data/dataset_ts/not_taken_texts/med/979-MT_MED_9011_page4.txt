Clinical Study Results
Part 2
Once the participants joined Part 2 of this study, they took either dapagliflozin
or the placebo once a day for 24 weeks. Each dapagliflozin dose contained 10
milligrams, also known as mg, of the drug.
At the end of this study, the participants went back to the study site for another
visit. The study doctors did a physical examination to check the overall health of
the participants. The study doctors also took more blood samples and checked
the kidneys of the participants.
The figure below shows how this study was done.

What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed
at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can
also be found on these websites.
Of the 321 participants in this study, 11 participants left this study early. Most
of the participants who left early took different amounts of insulin than they were
allowed to during this study. This means the researchers could not be sure if the
results they collected from these participants were from the study drug or
the insulin. So, the researchers could not use all of the results for these
11 participants.
