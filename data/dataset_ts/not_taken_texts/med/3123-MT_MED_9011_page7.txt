Clinical Study Results
None of the participants stopped taking treatments because of adverse reactions they
had during the study.
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
The most common adverse reactions were feeling jittery and having tremors. The
table below shows the most common adverse reactions that happened in 2 or more
participants taking either AS MDI or Proventil. The researchers thought that these
adverse reactions were related to the study treatment. There were other adverse
reactions, but these happened in fewer participants.
Most common adverse reactions during the study
AS MDI Proventil
(out of 45 participants) (out of 46 participants)
Feeling jittery 6.7% (3) 13% (6)
Tremors 4.4% (2) 4.3% (2)
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how AS MDI affects the breathing of people with
asthma, and how safe it is for them to take. The researchers found that the amount of air
that participants could breathe out was similar when participants took AS MDI compared
with Proventil.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AS MDI are planned.
