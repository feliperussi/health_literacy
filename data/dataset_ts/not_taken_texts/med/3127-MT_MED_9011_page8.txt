What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 3 participants in the placebo group who did not get any study
treatment. So, the results below are for the 410 participants who got at least 1
dose of study treatment.
Did benralizumab shrink the participants’ nasal polyps and reduce how
blocked their nose was?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab reduced the size of the
participants’ nasal polyps and how blocked their nose was.
To find out if the participants’ nasal polyps shrank during the study, the study
doctors used a special camera to take pictures of the participants’ nasal polyps.
Then they gave the participants a “score” from 0 to 4 for each nostril. A score
of 0 meant no polyps and a score of 4 meant large polyps that were completely
blocking the nostril. Because the participants had a score for each nostril, their
total score could range from 0 to 8. This was the participants’ “nasal polyp score”,
also called NPS. A higher NPS meant more nasal polyps or larger nasal polyps.
The researchers compared the participants’ NPS at the start of the study to their
NPS after 40 weeks of treatment. The researchers then calculated the average
change in NPS in the participants who took benralizumab and in the participants
who took the placebo.
