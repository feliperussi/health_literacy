What treatments did the participants receive?
In this study, the participants received either MEDI6012 or the placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who receive the
drug are actually caused by the drug.
None of the participants or the sponsor knew what treatment each participant
was receiving. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment
the participants are receiving can affect the results of the study. When the study
ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants received
so they could create a report of the study results. The study staff knew which
treatment each participant received, but they tried to make sure that the study
doctors did not find out this information so that it did not affect the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
received. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants received MEDI6012 or the placebo through a needle into a vein,
also known as an IV infusion. The dose of MEDI6012 was measured in milligrams,
also known as “mg”.
