What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants in Group
3 had during this study that the study doctors thought might be related to
the study drugs. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An
adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the study drugs.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
