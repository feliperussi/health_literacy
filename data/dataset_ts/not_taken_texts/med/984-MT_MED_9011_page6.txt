What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.

drug reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse drug reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. The
