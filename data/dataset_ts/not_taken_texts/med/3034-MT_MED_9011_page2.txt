Clinical Study Results
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how AZD9898 acted in the body. Researchers
think AZD9898 can stop the process of swelling in the breathing tubes. AZD9898 is also
expected to speed up the recovery from the symptoms of asthma.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answer to this question is important to know before other studies can be done that help find
out if AZD9898 improves the health of people with asthma.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. Everyone in the study was
between 18 and 50 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This study was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what participants were
taking but the participants did not. In this study, participants took either AZD9898 or a placebo.
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the study drug are
actually caused by the study drug. The study tested different doses of AZD9898 measured in
milligrams, called “mg” for short. The lowest dose tested was 3 mg and the highest was 45 mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
