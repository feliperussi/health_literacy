WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
Before starting this study, study doctors asked about each participant’s medical history, did a
physical exam and other tests, and took blood and urine samples to make sure each participant
could participate.
Part A lasted 5 weeks. Eight participants were assigned to 1 of the 8 treatment groups:
• 5 milligrams (mg) of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 25 mg of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 100 mg of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 200 mg of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 400 mg of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 800 mg of AZD9977 or a placebo
• 800 mg of AZD9977 in split doses or a placebo
• 1200 mg of AZD9977 in split doses or a placebo
Two participants withdrew from Part A of the study before it began. Out of each group of
8 participants, 6 participants took their assigned dose of AZD9977 and 2 participants took a placebo.
The first 6 participants who took AZD9977 got the 5 mg dose, and the last 6 participants got the
1200 mg dose.
Part B lasted 6 weeks. Eight new participants who were not in Part A were in this group and
they got 2 doses of AZD9977:
• First dose: all 8 participants took 40 mg of AZD9977 inside an IntelliCap capsule
• Second dose: the 7 participants who finished the study took 40 mg of AZD9977
