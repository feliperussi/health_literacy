Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with ovarian cancer. The participants
in this study were 35 to 91 years old when they joined.
Most of the participants had already received a type of cancer treatment known as
“platinum-based” chemotherapy that had shrunk their ovarian cancer completely
or partly.
The study included 272 participants in Canada and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to stop ovarian cancer from getting worse or
coming back after it has been treated with chemotherapy. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how well it
works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well olaparib worked in a
small number of participants with ovarian cancer. In people with cancer, the body
is not able to control the growth of cells. These cells can form tumors. In people
with ovarian cancer, tumors typically form in the ovaries, or they may form in other
nearby places, such as:
X the lining of the inside of the abdomen
X the lining of the uterus
X the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus
In adults with ovarian cancer, it is rare for tumors to form outside of the ovaries.
The study drug, olaparib, was designed to help stop tumor cells from repairing
themselves when they are damaged. This makes it harder for tumor cells to grow
and survive.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if olaparib helped stop the
participants’ cancer from coming back or getting worse after it had been treated
with chemotherapy. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
