Clinical Study Results
The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to know
if participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had more increased lung function before taking a treatment
dose compared with participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.

Lung function over 24 weeks
Researchers measured the participants’ average lung function over the course of
treatment.
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function before taking
a treatment dose compared with participants who took formoterol fumarate by
itself using MDI. They were able to exhale an average of 31 mL more air than
participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function over the
4 hours after taking a treatment dose compared with participants who took
budesonide by itself using MDI. They were able to exhale an average of
181 mL more air than participants who took budesonide by itself using MDI.
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together had a similar increase in lung function before taking a
treatment dose and at 4 hours after taking a treatment dose compared with
participants who took 400 µg of budesonide and 12 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using TBH.
