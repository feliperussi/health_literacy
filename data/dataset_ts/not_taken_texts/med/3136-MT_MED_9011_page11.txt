How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study is ongoing. The results so far have helped researchers learn more about
olaparib for women with ovarian cancer who had already received chemotherapy
that had worked partly or completely.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with olaparib are planned.
