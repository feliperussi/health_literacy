What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took either AZD9977 or spironolactone as
capsules by mouth.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took their randomly chosen study treatment once a day for 4
weeks. The doses of AZD9977 and spironolactone were measured in milligrams,
also called mg.
> For the first 2 weeks of the study, the participants took 100 mg AZD9977 or
25 mg of spironolactone.
> For the last 2 weeks of the study, the participants took 200 mg of AZD9977 or
50 mg of spironolactone.
The study doctors monitored each participant’s blood potassium during the study.
If it got too high, the participant stopped taking the study treatment and left the
study.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
