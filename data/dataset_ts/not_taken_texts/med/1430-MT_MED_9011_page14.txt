What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for Group 2 of this study were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participants’ tumors?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before larger studies can
be done to find out if adavosertib with carboplatin help improve the health of
people with ES-SCLC.
What treatments did the participants get?
All of the participants in Group 2 of this study got adavosertib with carboplatin.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The participants took adavosertib as capsules by mouth and got carboplatin
through a needle in a vein, also known as an IV infusion. The dose of adavosertib
was measured in milligrams, also known as mg. Each participant’s dose of
carboplatin was as recommended by the study doctors.
The researchers planned for the participants to get study treatment for at least
9 weeks. Then, the participants could continue to get study treatment until they
left the study, or until the study doctors thought the treatments were no longer
helping them.
The chart below shows the treatments that the participants in Group 2 got.
