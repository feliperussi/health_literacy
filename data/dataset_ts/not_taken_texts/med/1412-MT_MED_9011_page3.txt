Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants got MEDI9090, which is a combination of the study drugs
durvalumab and tremelimumab. Some participants also got durvalumab by itself
after they got MEDI9090. Durvalumab and MEDI9090 were each given through a
needle into a vein, also known as an IV infusion.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The study had 2 treatment periods. In the first treatment period, all of the
participants got an IV infusion of MEDI9090 once every 4 weeks. This treatment
period lasted for 4 months.
In the next treatment period, some of the participants got an IV infusion of
durvalumab every 4 weeks. The participants continued getting these infusions until
any of these happened:
• their cancer got worse
• the study doctor decided that study drug was no longer helping the participants
• they left the study for other reasons
The table below shows the treatments the participants got during the study:
