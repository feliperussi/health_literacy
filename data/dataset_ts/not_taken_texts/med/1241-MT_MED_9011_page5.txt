A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got benralizumab or the placebo as an injection into the skin.
They got 1 dose every 4 weeks for a total of 3 doses. The dose of benralizumab
was 30 milligrams, also known as mg.
In this study:
> 23 participants got benralizumab
> 23 participants got the placebo
What happened during the study?
Each participant was in the study for about 6 months. But, the entire study took
3 years to finish.
The study started in October 2016 and ended in October 2019.
At different points throughout the study, the study doctors measured the
participants’ allergic responses by triggering a controlled allergic reaction. This
is known as an “allergen challenge”. This is done in a safe environment with
doctors around in case there are any medical problems.
