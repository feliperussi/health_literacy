Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results
of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment
participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
The participants in this study either took RDEA3170 and febuxostat together, or they
took placebos. Each placebo looked like one of the study drugs but did not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see
in participants who take a treatment are actually caused by the treatment.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the doctors checked the overall health of the participants to make
sure that they could join the study. This included taking blood and urine samples, and
using a magnetic resonance imaging scan, also called an MRI, to check the kidney
and heart health of the participants. Doctors also checked the heart health of the
participants using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
If the doctors found that a participant was able to join the study, they asked them not
to change any medication they were already taking to keep their kidneys healthy. This
helped the doctors make sure any effects they saw during treatment were due to the
treatment in this study.
During treatment, the participants visited their study site 5 times. At the first visit,
the participants were given either RDEA3170 and febuxostat capsules, or the placebo
capsules.
The participants took 2 capsules every day. Each RDEA3170 capsule was 9 milligrams,
also known as mg. Each febuxostat capsule was 80 mg.
At each visit, the doctors or study staff took blood and urine samples. Before the last visit,
the doctors used another MRI to check the heart and kidney health of the participants.
After treatment, the participants visited their study site 1 time for a follow-up visit. At
this visit, the doctors took blood and urine samples from the participants and asked how
they were feeling.
