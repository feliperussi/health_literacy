Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD8871.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about AZD8871 to help people who have
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand
and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 7 months. But the entire study took about
10 months to finish.
The study started in October 2018 and ended in August 2019. It included 73 participants in
Germany and the United Kingdom.
When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the collected data and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
