During the study, study doctors did another physical examination and checked each
participants’ height, weight, and temperature. The study doctors also tested participants’
blood and urine to make sure that participants were still healthy, and asked participants
how they were feeling. Study doctors also checked each participant’s heart health using
an ECG.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during
this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies
to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies
with MEDI6012 are currently planned.
Did MEDI6012 increase the amount of good cholesterol in participants’ blood more
than the placebo?
Researchers wanted to know how the study drug affected the body. They wanted to
see if MEDI6012 treatment increased the amount of good cholesterol in the blood
of participants. Researchers found that the amount of good cholesterol in the blood
increased in the first 96 hours after treatment with MEDI6012. Participants who got the
placebo didn’t have these increases.
