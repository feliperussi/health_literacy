What happened during this study?
The study started in July 2017 and ended in March 2021. The study was ended
early because the study sponsor made a business decision to stop studying
AZD2811 in blood and bone marrow cancer.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 28 days. At this visit, the study
doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X checked how the participants were able to do their daily activities
X took blood samples
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
X took a sample of the participants’ bone marrow
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site up
to 8 times in the first cycle, up to 6 times during the second cycle, and at least 2
times every cycle until they stopped getting study treatment. At these visits, the
participants got AZD2811 and the study doctors checked their health. Some of
the participants also got chemotherapy.
After the participants stopped getting study treatment, they visited their
study site up to 2 times. The last visit could be replaced by a phone call for some
participants. This part of the study lasted for up to 1 month. At these visits, the
study doctors checked the health of the participants.
