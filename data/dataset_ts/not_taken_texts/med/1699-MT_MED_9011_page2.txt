Clinical Trial Results
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in January 2016 and ended in January 2017. It included
110 participants at 16 study sites in South Korea. When the study ended, the sponsor
reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers wanted to learn more about exenatide, a medicine used to treat
type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the body does not use insulin
normally. This makes the amount of sugar, or glucose, in the blood too high.
Exenatide was a new drug that works like a natural substance in the body called
glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1. GLP-1 helps keep blood sugar at healthy levels.
For people with type 2 diabetes, the GLP-1 in their body either doesn’t work well or
doesn’t work at all. Exenatide helps the body release its own insulin when needed
to reduce blood sugar level.
In this study, researchers wanted to see how safe exenatide is and how well it works
in people with type 2 diabetes.
Researchers wanted to learn:
• How many and what type of medical problems did
participants have when taking exenatide?
• How did the body react to exenatide treatment?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was an “open-label” study. This means that all of the participants, study
doctors, and staff knew what treatment each participant got. In this study, all
participants got exenatide.
Your study had 110 participants at 16 study centers in South Korea. All of the men
and women who participated were between the ages of 22 and 72 years.
