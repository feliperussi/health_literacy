Clinical Study Results
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how dapagliflozin, saxagliptin,
and metformin worked in participants with T2DM compared with glimepiride and
metformin.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with dapagliflozin are planned, but not with saxagliptin.
