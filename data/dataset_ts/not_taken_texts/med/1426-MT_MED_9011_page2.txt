Clinical Study Results
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how durvalumab acts in the
blood. The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did durvalumab act in the blood when given alone?
• How did durvalumab act in the blood when given with tremelimumab?
• How did tremelimumab act in the blood when given with durvalumab?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if durvalumab and tremelimumab improve the health of patients with
advanced solid tumors.
The researchers asked native Chinese men and women with advanced solid tumors
whose cancer had not gotten better with other treatment to participate in this study.
Everyone in the study was 33 to 76 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was getting.
In Part A, the participants were given 1 of 2 treatments:
• 20 milligrams of durvalumab per kilogram of body weight, or mg/kg
• 20 mg/kg of durvalumab and 1 mg/kg of tremelimumab
What happened during the study?
The participants got either durvalumab alone, or durvalumab and tremelimumab. Both
of these treatments were given through a needle placed into a vein. This is called an
intravenous infusion, also called an IV.
• 13 participants got durvalumab once every 4 weeks until their tumor grew.
• 13 participants got durvalumab and tremelimumab once every 4 weeks for up to
16 weeks. After that, they kept getting durvalumab once every 4 weeks until their
tumor grew.
