Overall, the researchers found that the number of viable tumor cells was reduced
in some participants who got durvalumab alone or with another treatment. They
also found that slightly more people who got durvalumab and another treatment
had a major pathological response, compared to those who got durvalumab
alone. But, the overall number of participants who received durvalumab alone or
durvalumab and another treatment was too small to know if the study treatments
definitely reduced the number of tumor cells.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for durvalumab, oleclumab, monalizumab, and danvatirsen.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
