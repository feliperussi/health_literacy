Clinical trial results
Part B
Part B of the study included 38 male and female participants with COPD who were 52 to 78
years old.
Part B of the study was “double-blind”. This means that none of the participants or study staff
knew what treatment each participant took.
What happened during the study?
Part A
Participants in Part A were in the study for up to about 3 months.
In Part A, participants visited the study site 5 times and had a follow-up phone call after the 5th visit
to check on the participants’ health. One Part A participant left the study before it was completed.
The first visit was a screening visit to make sure you and all the other participants were healthy
enough to take part in the study.
Part A had 2 groups, with 8 participants in each. The different doses of the study drug were given in
micrograms, or μg. This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.
The 8 participants in Group 1 got 3 treatments out of 50, 400, or 1800 μg of AZD8871 or a placebo.
Some participants got only AZD8871 treatments, and some participants got 2 AZD8871 treatments
and 1 placebo treatment.
The 8 participants in Group 2 got 3 treatments that were 200, 900, or 2100 μg of AZD8871 or a
placebo. Some participants got only AZD8871 treatments, and some participants got AZD8871 and
placebo treatments.
There was a “washout period” of 7 to 21 days between treatments. During the washout periods,
participants did not take any drugs. This helped get rid of any effects from previous treatments. The
figure below shows how Part A of the study was done.
