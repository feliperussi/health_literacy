Clinical Trial RESULTS
What’s happened since my study ended?
The study started in August 2016 and ended in October 2016. The entire
study took about 2 months to complete. It included 28 participants at 1 site
in the United States. When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data
and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Gout is a type of arthritis, or inflammation of the joints, that can cause pain
and stiffness. Even though you and the other participants in this study didn’t
have gout and were considered healthy, researchers believe that the results of
this study will help patients who do have gout.
In healthy people, uric acid is made when your body breaks down certain
substances. It usually leaves your body through urine. But gout can happen
when uric acid does not leave your body properly and instead builds up in the
blood and joints. The study drugs lesinurad and allopurinol are both used to
treat gout by helping reduce uric acid in your body. The sponsor wanted to
find out if it is effective to combine the 2 drugs into 1 tablet.
In this study, researchers wanted to know:
• Did similar amounts of lesinurad and allopurinol stay in
participants’ blood when taken with food as 1 combined
tablet compared to separate tablets?
• Did participants have medical problems during the study?
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants and study staff
knew what study drug each participant took.
