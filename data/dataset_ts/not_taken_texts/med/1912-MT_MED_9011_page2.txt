Clinical Trial RESULTS
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in February 2016 and ended in August 2016. It included 96
participants at 1 study site in the United Kingdom. When the study ended, the
sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary
of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before patients can take a new drug, the company developing it must do research
studies to show that it is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new drug is
to test it in healthy people. This means people without any serious health problems.
Your study drug, AZD5718, is being developed to treat heart disease.
Leukotriene B4, which is also called LTB4, is a substance your body makes naturally,
and it leaves the body through urination. LTB4 can cause inflammation, which can
result in redness, warmth, swelling, or pain in the body. Inflammation can cause heart
disease or make heart disease worse if you already have it. So far, research has shown
that AZD5718 lowers the amount of LTB4 your body makes. This could also lower
inflammation and help those with heart disease.
In this study, researchers compared 2 forms of AZD5718, Liquid 1 and Liquid 2.
Both liquids had AZD5718 in them, but the AZD5718 in Liquid 1 had a different
chemical makeup than the AZD5718 in Liquid 2. Researchers compared the 2 liquids
to each other and to a liquid taken with placebo. Placebo looks like the study drug
but contains no real medicine. Researchers wanted to know:
• What was the highest dose of AZD5718 that was safe to take?
• What medical problems did participants have after they got AZD5718?
• How did AZD5718 affect the body?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was “single-blind”. This means that the study staff knew which drug the
participants took, but the participants did not. Study staff found out which drug each
participant took after the participants’ last visit. You and other participants got either
AZD5718 or placebo.
All of the study participants were healthy men who were between 19 to 50 years old.
