Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical
problem. So, when new drugs are studied, researchers keep track of all
medical problems that participants develop during the study. These
medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be
caused by the study drug.
How many participants developed medical problems during the study?
The table below shows how many participants in each treatment group
had medical problems. None of the participants stopped taking the
study drug because of a medical problem. Researchers do not think the
study drug caused any of the medical problems.
