Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if MEDI9447 helps improve the health of people who have
advanced cancer.
What treatments did the participants get?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
In this study, the participants got 1 of 2 MEDI9447 treatments through a needle into
a vein. This is also known as an intravenous infusion, also called an IV infusion.
The 2 treatment doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg:
• 1,500 mg of MEDI9447
• 3,000 mg of MEDI9447
