Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• checked the blood sugar levels and weight of the participants
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During treatment, there were 2 treatment groups. Participants in both groups were
given either MEDI0382 or a placebo through a needle under the skin. There were 39
participants in Group 1 and 26 participants in Group 2.
Throughout the treatment period, the researchers checked all participants’ blood sugar
levels and weight and asked them how they were feeling.
In Group 1, 26 participants were given MEDI0382 and 13 participants were given the
placebo. The MEDI0382 doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg. The
participants visited their study site 8 times over the course of 7 weeks and were given the
below doses in order:
• 50 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 1 week
• 100 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 1 week
• 200 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 1 week
• 300 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 4 weeks
In Group 2, 20 participants were given MEDI0382 and 6 participants were given the
placebo. The participants visited their study site 6 times over the course of 7 weeks and
were given the below doses in order:
• 50 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 2 weeks
• 100 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 2 weeks
• 200 μg of MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day for 2 weeks
