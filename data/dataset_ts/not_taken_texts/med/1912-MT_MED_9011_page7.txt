How did AZD5718 affect the body?
Researchers also wanted to know how AZD5718 affects the body. Researchers
wanted to see if the drug lowered LTB4 in the body. So they tested blood samples
from you and other participants to find out. They found that:
• Participants who got higher doses of AZD5718 (Liquid 1) had less
LTB4 in their blood. LTB4 also left the blood faster.
• LTB4 left the blood faster in participants who got 100 or
300 mg of Liquid 1, compared to 100 or 300 mg of Liquid 2.
