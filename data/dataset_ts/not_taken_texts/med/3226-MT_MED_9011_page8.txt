The researchers looked at 6 types of inflammatory cells. All of these cells are part
of the immune system that helps to protect the body from infections. The 6 types
of cells that the researchers looked at are called:
X eosinophils
X neutrophils
X CD3+ cells
X CD4+ cells
X tryptase+ mast cells
X chymase+ mast cells
Overall, the researchers found that the number of eosinophils per square
millimeter decreased more in the participants who got tezepelumab than in those
who got the placebo. For all the other cell types, the researchers found that the
changes in cell numbers were similar in both treatment groups. The results were
too similar for the researchers to know if tezepelumab affected the numbers of
these inflammation cells.
The list below shows the results. A ratio lower than 1.00 means that the average
number of cells decreased more or increased less in the participants who got
tezepelumab. A ratio higher than 1.00 means that the average number of cells
decreased less or increased more in the participants who got tezepelumab. The
researchers found that the ratios of cells per square millimeter in the tezepelumab
group compared to the placebo group were:
X 0.15 for eosinophils
X 1.36 for neutrophils
X 1.12 for CD3+ cells
X 1.18 for CD4+ cells
X 0.83 for tryptase+ mast cells
X 1.19 for chymase+ mast cells
