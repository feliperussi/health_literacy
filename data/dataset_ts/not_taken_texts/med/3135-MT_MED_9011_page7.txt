While the participants in Part 2 got study treatment, they visited their
study site:
X 3 times in the first week, then
X once a week for 6 weeks, then
X every 2 weeks for 12 weeks
At these visits, the study doctors gave the participants their doses of study
treatment and checked their health. The participants in Part 2 also kept a diary and
answered surveys about their symptoms and quality of life. If the doctors thought
the study treatments were helping the participants, they could keep getting study
treatment for longer.
After the participants stopped getting study treatment, they visited
their study site 2 times in the first 3 months. The participants whose cancer had
worsened at the time they had stopped getting study treatment ended their
participation in the study after these 2 visits. The participants whose cancer had
not gotten worse continued to visit their study site once every 3 months until their
cancer did get worse. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants.
