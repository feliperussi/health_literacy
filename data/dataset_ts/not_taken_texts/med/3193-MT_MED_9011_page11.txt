Did the participants feel that getting benralizumab while taking a lower
dose of oral corticosteroids or no oral corticosteroids helped them
control their asthma symptoms and helped their quality of life?
To answer this question, the researchers asked the participants to complete 2
different surveys throughout the study. These surveys were called:
X Asthma Control Questionnaire-6, also called ACQ-6
X St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, also called SGRQ
ACQ-6
After the participants completed the ACQ-6 survey, the researchers calculated the
score for each participant based on their responses to the survey. ACQ-6 scores
could range from 0 to 6. A lower ACQ-6 score meant that the participant’s asthma
symptoms were better controlled. The researchers calculated the scores for all of
the participants before they started getting benralizumab and at the end of the
study.
The researchers found that, on average, ACQ-6 scores decreased by 1.04
points after the participants got benralizumab with their lowest dose of oral
corticosteroids or no oral corticosteroids.
The researchers also counted how many participants’ ACQ-6 scores decreased
by at least 0.5 points. The study doctors think that a decrease of 0.5 points
could mean that benralizumab helped control the participants’ asthma symptoms.
Overall, there were 51.5% of participants whose ACQ-6 scores decreased by
at least 0.5 points during the study. This was 308 out of 598 participants. This
means that overall, the participants felt that benralizumab helped control their
asthma symptoms.
