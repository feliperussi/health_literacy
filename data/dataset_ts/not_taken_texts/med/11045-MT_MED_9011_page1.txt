Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study treatments GP MDI, also
called glycopyrronium metered dose inhaler, and FF MDI, also called formoterol
fumarate metered dose inhaler.
You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how GP MDI
and FF MDI may help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also
called COPD.

What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 12 weeks. But, the entire study took about
1.5 years to finish. The study started in December 2016 and ended in May 2018.
The study included 23 participants in Belgium. Some of the participants did not
complete the study. One participant left the study after taking GP MDI only, and
3 participants left the study after taking FF MDI only. All 4 participants left the study
because of worsening COPD.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
