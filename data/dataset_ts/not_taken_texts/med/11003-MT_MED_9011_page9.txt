Clinical Study Results
At 24 weeks:
• Participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had more improved COPD symptoms and ability to do daily
activities compared with participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself
using MDI.
• The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to
know if participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more improved COPD symptoms and ability
to do daily activities compared with participants who took:
- budesonide by itself using MDI
- 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together using MDI
- 400 µg of budesonide and 12 µg of formoterol fumarate together using TBH
• The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to
know if participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more improved COPD symptoms and ability
to do daily activities compared with participants who took either budesonide or
formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
Over 24 weeks:
• The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to
know if participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had improved COPD symptoms and ability to
do daily activities compared with participants who took either budesonide or
formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
• Participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had similar improvement in COPD symptoms and ability to
do daily activities compared with participants who took 400 µg of budesonide
and 12 µg of formoterol fumarate together using TBH.
• The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to
know if participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together had more improved COPD symptoms and ability to do daily
activities compared with participants who took either budesonide or formoterol
fumarate by itself using MDI.
