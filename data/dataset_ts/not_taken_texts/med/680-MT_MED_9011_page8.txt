Did olaparib help the participants live longer with their cancer before it
got worse?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took olaparib lived
longer with their cancer before it got worse compared with the participants who
took the NHA treatments.
To answer this question, the researchers took pictures of the participants’ tumors
using MRI or CT scans. To measure tumor growth, they used a set of rules called
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also known as RECIST. Then, the
researchers counted the number of months between the participants taking study
treatment and their cancer spreading or growing. They compared these results in
the participants who took olaparib and in those who took the NHA treatments.
Overall, the researchers found that the average number of months until the
participants’ cancer got worse was:
> 7.4 months for the participants who took olaparib
> 3.6 months for the participants who took the NHA treatments
