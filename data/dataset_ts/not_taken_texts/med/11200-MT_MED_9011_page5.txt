What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the
available data for these treatments.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
