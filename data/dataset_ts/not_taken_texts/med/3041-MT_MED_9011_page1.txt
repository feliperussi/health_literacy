Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study treatment
dapagliflozin. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about how dapagliflozin
affects people with type 2 diabetes and healthy kidneys, as well as people who do not have type
2 diabetes but have low functioning kidneys. “Low functioning kidneys” are kidneys that remove
lower amounts of sodium in the urine compared to healthy kidneys.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand
and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
study doctor or staff at your study site.
