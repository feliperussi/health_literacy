Clinical Trial Results
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in May 2016 and ended in November 2016. The study included 300
participants at 3 study sites in the United States. When the study ended, the sponsor
reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new vaccine can be approved, research must be done to show that it is safe and
effective. FluMist is a nasal spray vaccine that was developed to treat influenza, which is
commonly called the flu. The flu is caused by a virus that infects your nose, throat, and
lungs. Some symptoms of the flu are fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, stuffy
nose, and tiredness.
Each year, different or new strains of flu can cause illness. So, all flu vaccines have to
be adjusted to protect people against these different or new strains. In this study,
researchers tested 1 strain of the FluMist vaccine.
If the results of this study showed that this 1-strain vaccine is safe, then this 1-strain
vaccine might be able to be combined with other flu strains to make a new FluMist
nasal spray.
In this study, researchers compared the 1-strain vaccine to a placebo. The placebo looked
like the flu vaccine but contained no real medicine. Researchers use a placebo so that
they can compare the results of participants who get study drugs with the results of
participants who get study drugs.
In your study, researchers wanted to know:
• Did more participants who got the 1-strain vaccine have a fever in the first 7 days
after getting the vaccine compared to participants who got the placebo?
• Did more participants who got the 1-strain vaccine have certain symptoms in the
first 7 and the first 14 days compared to participants who got the placebo?
• What medical problems, if any, did participants have after getting the 1-strain
vaccine or the placebo?
