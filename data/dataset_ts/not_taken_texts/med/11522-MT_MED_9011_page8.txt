There was 1 participant who was planned to take ceralasertib with acalabrutinib,
but only took acalabrutinib. The data from this participant is included in the
results below.
Was the amount of ceralasertib that got into the participants’ blood
different when taken by itself compared to with acalabrutinib?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of ceralasertib
and acalabrutinib in the participants’ blood at different times after they had
taken each treatment.
Overall, the researchers found that the amount of ceralasertib in the blood was
similar when ceralasertib was taken by itself and when ceralasertib was taken
with acalabrutinib.
