Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid
tumors. The participants in this study were 21 to 78 years old when they joined.
The study included 38 participants in Australia and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before
a treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. A “solid” tumor is a type of cancer that starts in
an organ of the body. “Advanced” usually means that the cancer keeps growing
even with treatment.
Normally, the immune system fights infections or anything it does not recognize,
and can help stop tumors from growing or surviving. But in some people with
solid tumors, proteins on the tumor cells can interact with certain proteins on the
immune cells. This stops the immune cells from attacking the tumor cells.
The study treatments, MEDI5083 and durvalumab, were designed to stop the
tumor cells from interacting with some of these immune cell proteins. This would
help the immune cells stop the tumor from growing.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI5083
and durvalumab in participants with advanced solid tumors. This was the first time
MEDI5083 was studied in people.
