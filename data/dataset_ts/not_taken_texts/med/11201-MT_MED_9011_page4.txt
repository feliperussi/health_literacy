Clinical Study Results
The study doctors measured:
• the average highest amount of AZD5718 in the participants’ blood
• the average total amount of AZD5718 in the participants’ blood over time
The researchers found that for both measurements, the average amounts of AZD5718 in the
blood corresponded with the levels of doses the participants took. This means they were lowest
when the participants took dose 1 and highest when they took dose 3.
Average highest amount of AZD5718
The average highest amount of AZD5718 was measured in units called nanomoles per litre, also
known as nmol/L. The researchers found that the average highest amount of AZD5718 in the
blood after each dose was:
• 13.4 nmol/L when the participants took dose 1 of AZD5718
• 38.4 nmol/L when the participants took dose 2 of AZD5718
• 157.1 nmol/L when the participants took dose 3 of AZD5718
