How much AZD5718 was found in the participants’ urine and faeces?
To answer this question, the researchers took urine and faeces samples from the
participants before and after they took AZD5718. The researchers collected these
samples for up to 13 days after the participants took the single radioactive dose.
The researchers measured the total amount of radioactivity that was found in the
participants’ urine and faeces. Then, they calculated the percentage from the
original amount of radioactivity that the participants took. This helped them learn
how much AZD5718 had been processed and was found in the urine and faeces.
Overall, the researchers found that:
> 85.2% of the original amount of AZD5718 that the participants took was
found in their urine and faeces.
