What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before
and after the participants took capivasertib. The doctors did physical exams and
tested the participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall health.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the results
of these tests and measurements but, the researchers did not consider these
changes to be clinically important.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had.
