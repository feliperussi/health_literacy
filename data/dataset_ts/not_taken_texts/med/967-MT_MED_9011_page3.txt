Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other study
staff knew what drug treatment each participant took during the study. Some studies are
done this way because knowing what drug treatment the participants are taking can affect
the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which drug
treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
The participants in the study took 1 of 3 drug treatments:
• dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin
• dapagliflozin, a placebo, and metformin
• saxagliptin, a placebo, and metformin
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the
drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the drug treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each drug treatment is as accurate as possible.
All of the drugs in this study were taken in tablet form by mouth.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the participants visited their study site twice over the course
of 3 weeks. During these visits, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the HbA1c levels of the participants
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site up to 4 more times over the
course of 24 weeks.
