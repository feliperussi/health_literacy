What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each

questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the website listed at the
end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found
on the website.
How did different combinations of the study drugs act in the body?
The researchers wanted to learn how different combinations of dapagliflozin,
saxagliptin, and metformin acted in the body when taken with and without food.
Four of the treatments were taken with food:
• 2 of the treatments had different doses of all 3 drugs combined together
• 2 of the treatments had either the approved form of saxagliptin or the approved
form of a drug that had both dapagliflozin and metformin
Two of the treatments were taken without food:
• These 2 treatments also had different doses of all 3 drugs combined together
The researchers compared the average and highest amounts of the 3 drugs in the
blood after the participants took each treatment. They found:
• When taken with food, the 3 drugs in the combined-dose treatments and the
approved-dose treatments reached a similar average amount in the blood.
• The highest average amount of dapagliflozin in the blood was about 38% lower
when the participants took the drug with food compared to when the participants
took it without food.
• The highest average amounts of saxagliptin and metformin in the blood were similar
when the participants took the drugs with food compared to when the participants
took them without food.
