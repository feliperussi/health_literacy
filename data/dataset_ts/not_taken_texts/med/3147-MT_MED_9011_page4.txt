What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if AZD8601 helps improve the health of people who are
having CABG surgery.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got either AZD8601 or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
get the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants,
researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each
participant was getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing
what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study.
When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the
participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got either 3 milligrams of AZD8601 or the placebo as injections
into the heart during their CABG surgery. The participants were unconscious
when they had their surgery and received the injections. There were 7
participants who got AZD8601 and 4 participants who got the placebo.
What happened during this study?
The participants were in the study for up to 9 months. But, the entire study took
3 years and 5 months to finish.
