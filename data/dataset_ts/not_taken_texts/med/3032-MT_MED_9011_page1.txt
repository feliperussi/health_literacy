Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: Ticagrelor
Study Title: A study to learn if different forms of ticagrelor reach
different levels in the blood in healthy volunteers
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study
drug ticagrelor.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in July 2017. The study included
44 participants in Germany.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created
a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat sickle cell disease. Before a drug can be
approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and
how it works.
People with sickle cell disease have fewer red blood cells than normal. This can cause
pain and other severe symptoms. Ticagrelor is already approved to treat people with
other diseases. The researchers wanted to know if ticagrelor could help people with sickle
cell disease.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much ticagrelor reached the blood of
participants when the drug was taken in different forms in the same amount.
