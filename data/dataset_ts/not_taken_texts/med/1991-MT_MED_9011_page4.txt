Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Up to 28 days before the participants took study treatment, they visited the study
site at least 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants’ overall
health to make sure that they could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked about the participants’ health and any medications they were taking
• measured the participants’ blood pressure. The participants were also given
blood pressure meters to check their blood pressure at home.
The study doctors also took pictures of the participants’ tumors using computed
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Computed tomography is
also known as “CT” and magnetic resonance imaging is also known as “MRI”.
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
