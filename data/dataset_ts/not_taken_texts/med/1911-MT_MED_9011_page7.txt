Clinical Trial Results
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
About the same number of participants had medical problems after taking abediterol or
AZD7594 alone and after taking the study drugs in separate inhalers. Fewer participants had
medical problems after taking abediterol and AZD7594 together in 1 inhaler. Two participants
(6.3%) stopped taking the study drugs because of medical problems. Study doctors felt these
medical problems were not related to AZD7594 or abediterol.
The table below shows how many participants had medical problems in this study.
