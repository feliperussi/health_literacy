Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make
sure the participants could join the study. They checked the heart health of the
participants using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG. The doctors
also asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking.
The participants checked in at the study site 1 day before the study started and
stayed overnight.
During the study, the participants stayed at the study site overnight for the
entire treatment visit. Each participant took his treatment once a day during this
treatment visit.
Treatment lasted 10 days for the first 2 groups.
The researchers ended the treatment early for Group 3. One of the participants in
this group had a medical problem. For safety reasons, the researchers decided to
stop treatment for the whole group.
To find a dose that causes fewer medical problems, the researchers started Group
4, and the treatment in this group lasted for 14 days. This group took a low dose
that was higher than the Group 1 dose but lower than the Group 2 dose.
During these visits, the study doctors took blood and urine samples. They checked
the heart health of the participants using an ECG. They also asked how the
participants were feeling and what medicines they were taking.
Participants in each group took either AZD4831 or the placebo:
• 2 participants took the placebo and 8 participants took the lowest dose
of AZD4831 in Group 1.
• 2 participants took the placebo and 8 participants took the high dose
of AZD4831 in Group 2.
• 2 participants took the placebo and 5 participants took the highest dose
of AZD4831 in Group 3.
• 2 participants took the placebo and 8 participants took the low dose
of AZD4831 in Group 4.
Participants left the study site 2 days after their last dose.
