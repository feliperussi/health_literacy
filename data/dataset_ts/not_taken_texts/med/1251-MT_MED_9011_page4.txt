Clinical Trial RESULTS
The figure below shows how the study was done.
Day 1 Follow-up visits on Days
5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 42, 57, and 85
300-mg anifrolumab
injection (6 participants) (6 participants)
300-mg anifrolumab IV
(6 participants) (6 participants)
600-mg anifrolumab infusion
pump (6 participants) (6 participants)
placebo injection or IV
(12 participants) (12 participants)
Up to 16 weeks
During the study, researchers checked each participant’s blood pressure, pulse
rate, and temperature. They also took blood for testing, and checked the heart
using an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Researchers also asked participants how
they were feeling, and if they had any pain where they got the injection.
After the treatments were over, participants returned to the study center for
follow-up visits 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 42, 57, and 85 days after getting anifrolumab
or a placebo. During these visits, researchers continued to take blood and urine
samples, and to ask participants how they were feeling. Researchers also did an
ECG to check participants’ heart health, and did a full physical exam at the last
visit on Day 85.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers
asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the
results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for
participants. Further clinical studies with anifrolumab are planned in 2017.
