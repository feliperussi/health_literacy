Did durvalumab alone help the participants live at least as long as
standard treatment?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab
alone lived at least as long as the participants who got standard treatment.
The average number of months that the participants lived after starting trial
treatment was:
X 16.6 months for the participants who got durvalumab alone
X 13.8 months for the participants who got the standard treatment
Did durvalumab alone help the participants live longer than standard
treatment?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were some differences between
the groups. But, the differences were too small for the researchers to decide if
getting durvalumab alone helped participants live longer than getting standard
treatment.
The average number of months that the participants lived after starting trial
treatment was:
X 16.6 months for the participants who got durvalumab alone
X 13.8 months for the participants who got the standard treatment
The researchers then did statistical tests on these results that showed that
getting durvalumab alone did not help participants live longer than getting
standard treatment. The results for each participant in a group can be very
different. So, even though the average number of months the participants lived
was higher in the durvalumab group compared to the standard treatment group,
the overall difference between the 2 groups was too small to be significant.
