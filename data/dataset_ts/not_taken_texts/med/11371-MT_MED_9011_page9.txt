The researchers found that after 4 weeks of treatment, the percentage of
participants who stayed alive and could breathe without help was similar between
the 2 groups.
The percentage of participants who were alive and could breathe without help
after 4 weeks of treatment was:
X 80.6% of those who were planned to get acalabrutinib with BSC. This was
25 out of 31 participants.
X 83.9% of those who were planned to get BSC only. This was 26 out of
31 participants.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to acalabrutinib.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care. This summary does not include adverse reactions for the
participants who got BSC only.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by acalabrutinib. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for acalabrutinib.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?
There were 23.3% of participants who got acalabrutinib and BSC who had adverse
reactions. This was 7 out of 30 participants.
There were 6.7% of participants who got acalabrutinib and BSC who stopped
getting acalabrutinib due to adverse reactions. This was 2 out of 30 participants.
