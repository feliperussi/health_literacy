Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ body weight?
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ calorie intake?
• Did MEDI0382 affect how many calories the participants burned off?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if MEDI0382 improves the health of people who have type 2
diabetes and are overweight or have obesity.
What treatments were the participants given?
There were 2 parts to this study. In Part 1, all of the participants were given a
placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. In Part
2, the participants were given either MEDI0382 or a placebo. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who are
given the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Throughout the study, the participants also kept taking metformin.
Part 1 was “single-blind”. This means the researchers, study doctors, and other
study staff knew what the participants were being given but the participants did not.
Part 2 was “double-blind”. This means none of the participants, researchers, study
doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was being given.
Some of the participants either left the study before Part 2 started or did not have
complete results for Part 1. So, only 25 participants started Part 2.
During Part 2, the participants who were given MEDI0382 started at a low dose.
Then, the dose was slowly increased during the study.
Both MEDI0382 and the placebo were given through a needle under the skin,
called an injection. The doses of MEDI0382 were measured in micrograms, also
called μg.
