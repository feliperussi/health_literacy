What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD2811 in
participants with AML or MDS.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What was the highest dose of AZD2811 that did not cause too many
side effects?
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD2811 helps improve the health of people with blood and
bone marrow cancer.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants got AZD2811 through a needle into a vein, also known as an
“IV infusion”. Some of the participants also got different types of chemotherapy,
depending on what the study doctors thought was best for each participant.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
This study was also a “dose finding” study. This means that some of the
participants started out getting a low dose of AZD2811. The study doctors looked
at the results for these participants. Then, the researchers decided whether to
change the dose of AZD2811 in the next group of participants.
Each participant stayed in the same dose group throughout the study. The
participants got AZD2811 in 4-week periods called “cycles”.
