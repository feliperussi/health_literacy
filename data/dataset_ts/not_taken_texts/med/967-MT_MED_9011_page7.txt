Clinical Study Results
What adverse reactions did the participants have that doctors thought were
related to study treatment?
The most common adverse reactions were lowering of kidney function and urinary
tract infection.
The table below shows the most common adverse reactions that happened in at least
3 participants in any treatment group. There were other adverse reactions, but these
happened in fewer participants.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
These results helped researchers learn more about how dapagliflozin and saxagliptin
affect the HbA1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes who are already taking metformin
when the 2 drugs are taken together, compared to when taken separately.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin taken together are not planned.
