What are the safety results of AZD1222?
This is a summary of the safety results from all 4 trials so far. During the trials, the
doctors keep track of the “adverse events” that the participants have. An adverse
event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a trial. Doctors keep
track of all the adverse events that happen in trials, even if they do not think
the adverse events might be related to the trial injections. An adverse event is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the
participant needs hospital care. Adverse events are ”graded” from 1 to 4 based
on their severity. The higher the grade, the more severe the adverse event is.
Adverse events may or may not be related to the trial injections or procedures in
the trial. A lot of research is needed to know whether an adverse event is related
to a trial injection.
Independent reviewers looked at the results to help the researchers decide if a sign or
symptom is an adverse event or serious adverse event. These are professionals who do not
work for the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca, or any other sponsor, and were not involved
in performing the trial. This helps make sure that the results are looked at fairly.
