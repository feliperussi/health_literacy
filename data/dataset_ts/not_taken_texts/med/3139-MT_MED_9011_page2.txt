Clinical Study Results
Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent strokes in people who are at
increased risk of having a stroke. Before a drug can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either ticagrelor or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
drug but does not have any medicine in it. All of the participants also took an existing
treatment for prevention of strokes called acetylsalicylic acid, also called ASA.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did fewer participants who took ticagrelor have a stroke or die within 30 days
of taking study treatment?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that 5.4% of the participants who took ticagrelor
and ASA had strokes or died within the 30 days of taking study treatment. They
found that 6.5% of the participants who took the placebo and ASA had a stroke or
died within the 30 days of taking study treatment.
• What serious medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 1.5% of participants who had serious medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most
common serious medical problems were strokes caused by a blood clot and
problems related to bleeding.
