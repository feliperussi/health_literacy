Clinical Trial RESULTS
During the study, doctors checked each participant’s blood pressure, pulse
rate, and temperature. They also tested participants’ blood and urine to make
sure the participants were still healthy, and asked participants how they
were feeling. Finally, study doctors checked participants’ hearts using an
electrocardiogram, or ECG.
In between treatments, each group had a two day “washout period”. During
the washout periods, participants did not take any drugs, except for their
rescue inhaler if needed. This helped get rid of any effects from previous
treatments.
What were the study results?
Was there a link between Symbicort and the amount of oxygen used
throughout the body compared to a placebo?
Researchers looked at the amount of oxygen participants’ bodies used to
answer this question.
Researchers compared participants’ oxygen consumption before taking
a dose of Symbicort or placebo to their oxygen consumption after their
dose. The figure on the next page shows this change in participants’ oxygen
consumption in milliliters per minute, or mL/min. This is a widely accepted
scientific unit of measurement.
Researchers found that the increase in oxygen consumption while
taking Symbicort was 10.1 mL/min higher than the increase in oxygen
consumption while taking a placebo. Participants’ oxygen consumption
after taking Symbicort increased by 11.37 mL/min compared to their oxygen
consumption before taking Symbicort. Participants’ oxygen consumption
after taking a placebo increased by 1.25 mL/min compared to their oxygen
consumption before taking a placebo.
