Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or fatty liver. Having T2DM can cause
these conditions. Before a drug can be approved for people to receive,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants receive?
The participants in this study received MEDI0382 or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did the participantsâ€™ glycogen levels in the liver change after
receiving MEDI0382?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the liver glycogen levels,
also called sugar stores that are used as energy in the body, changed
more in the participants who received MEDI0382, compared with
those who received the placebo. Glycogen levels were lower for the
participants who received MEDI0382.
X What medical problems happened during this study?
There were 76.2% of participants who had medical problems that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the
study. The most common medical problem was nausea.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this
summary.
