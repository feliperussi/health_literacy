What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
X How many participantsâ€™ tumors shrank after treatment with MEDI0457 and
durvalumab?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if MEDI0457 and durvalumab help improve the health of people
with HPV-associated head and neck cancer.
