Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat relapsed or refractory high-risk
CLL. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
CLL is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells and bone marrow,
which is the spongy material found inside some bones. In CLL, the bone marrow
produces too many white blood cells, which are not fully developed and do
not work properly. Over time, this can cause problems such as a higher risk of
infections, fatigue, unusual bleeding or bruising, and swollen glands in the neck,
armpits, or groin.
Researchers think that the study drugs, ceralasertib and acalabrutinib, may
be helpful in treating certain types of cancer. They are designed to work by
stopping the cancer cells from growing out of control.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how ceralasertib works and its
safety when taken by itself and with acalabrutinib in participants with CLL.
