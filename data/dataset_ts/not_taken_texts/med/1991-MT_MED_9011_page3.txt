Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did cediranib and olaparib shrink the participants’ tumors?
• Did the participants feel that cediranib and olaparib helped their overall
well-being?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer these questions, the researchers asked for the help of women with
ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer. The participants in
this study:
• were 42 to 80 years old
• had their cancer come back after completing several earlier cancer
treatments, including chemotherapy
Sometimes genetic changes called BRCA mutations are found in patients with
ovarian cancer. The participants in this study did not have these changes in their
genes.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
The participants took cediranib and olaparib as tablets by mouth. The doses were
measured in milligrams, also called mg.
During the study, the participants took:
• 30 mg of cediranib once daily
• 200 mg olaparib twice daily
The participants continued taking the study drugs until their cancer got worse,
they decided to stop taking part in the study, or the study doctors stopped their
participation. So, each participant was in the study for a different period of time.
