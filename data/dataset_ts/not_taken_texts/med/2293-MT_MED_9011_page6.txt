Clinical Study Results
Although the researchers were mainly interested in the participants’ HbA1c levels
after 24 weeks of treatment, they kept measuring the participants’ HbA1c levels
through 52 weeks of treatment. The researchers learned that on average, after
52 weeks of treatment:
• the participants who took 5 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin had a 0.20%
decrease in their HbA1c levels compared with participants who took the
placebo with insulin
• the participants who took 10 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin had a 0.25%
decrease in their HbA1c levels compared with participants who took the
placebo with insulin
The charts below show these results.

What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
