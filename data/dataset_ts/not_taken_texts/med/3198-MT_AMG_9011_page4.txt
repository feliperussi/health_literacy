5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
What investigational medicines were studied?
All participants in this study took cinacalcet. Participants were treated daily with
cinacalcet for 28 weeks. About 4 weeks after their treatment ended, participants visited
their study doctors to see how they were doing after taking cinacalcet:
Cinacalcet was taken every day at about the same time. It could have been taken
different ways based on the dose the study doctor wanted the participant to take, and if
the participants could swallow whole pills (capsules or tablets):
5 mg A rounded pill made of 2 halves (or shells) that can be pulled apart. The
Capsule: capsule is filled with cinacalcet powder. The 2 halves were opened and
devorppA
powder sprinkled onto soft food and eaten, or added to a sugary syrup and
swallowed. The sugary syrup with the cinacalcet could be added to feeding
tubes of participants who could not swallow food or water.
30 mg Tablet: A solid green pill covered in a waxy coating. The tablet could not be crushed
or broken, and was swallowed whole.
6. What Were the Side Effects?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called side effects)?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen when
you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record side effects that they
believe are possibly caused by the investigational medicine each patient is
receiving. These are also called “adverse reactions” and can be considered “related” to
the investigational medicine.
