Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: Pearl Therapeutics, Inc., a member of the AstraZeneca Group
Treatment Studied: Albuterol sulfate pressurized inhalation suspension, also
called AS MDI
Study Title: This study was done to learn how different doses of albuterol
sulfate given in an inhaler worked and how safe it was in people
with asthma
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study of the treatment AS MDI, also called albuterol
sulfate pressurized inhalation suspension. You and all the participants helped researchers
learn more about AS MDI to help people with asthma.
Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand
and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to about 10 weeks. The study started
in December 2017 and ended in March 2018. The study took place in the USA. It included
86 participants; 78 participants completed the study.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with asthma. Before a treatment can
be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AS MDI works in a small number of
participants with mild to moderate asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had
any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow. This makes it difficult to breathe. People
with asthma can have wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. There is
currently no cure for asthma, but there are treatments that can help with the symptoms.
