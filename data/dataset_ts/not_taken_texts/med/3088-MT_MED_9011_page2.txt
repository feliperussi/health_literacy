Clinical Study Results
The body gets rid of potassium in urine through the kidneys. If the kidneys are
not working normally, they might not be able to get rid of extra potassium to
keep the body’s potassium levels normal. ZS is a treatment that may help the
body get rid of extra potassium to help lower these levels.
Researchers also wanted to know how ZS would affect the sodium levels in
the urine of participants. Sodium is a substance found in food. The body needs
sodium to maintain weight and blood pressure. But, too much sodium can cause
weight gain and high blood pressure. The kidneys filter extra sodium out of the
body and get rid of it through urine.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did ZS affect the potassium levels in the body?
• How did ZS affect the sodium levels in the urine?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if ZS can treat Chinese patients with high potassium
levels.
In the study, the researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women.
Everyone in the study was 22 to 53 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants,
doctors, or other study staff knew which treatment each participant received.
All of the participants in the study took 1 of the following treatments:
• 11 participants took 5 grams, also known as g, of ZS
• 11 participants took 10 g of ZS
Participants took ZS by mouth as a powder that was mixed with water.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
