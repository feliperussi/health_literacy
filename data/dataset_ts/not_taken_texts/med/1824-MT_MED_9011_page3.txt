Clinical Trial RESULTS
What happened during the study?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to 16 weeks.
Before the study started, study doctors did tests to check on your
health and asked you questions to make sure you could join the
study. They did a physical examination, which included checking
your height, weight, and body temperature. They also tested
samples of your urine and blood to check your overall health,
and did an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check your heart health.
Researchers also asked about your medical history, how you were
feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
You and all of the other participants who finished the study took
all 5 AZD9496 treatments. Four of the treatments were in capsule
form using 1 of 3 formulas: Capsule A, Capsule B, or Capsule C. The
other treatment was AZD9496 in tablet form. Participants took the 5
treatments in the order listed below:
• Capsule A - 100 milligrams, or mg, of AZD9496
• Tablet - 100 mg of AZD9496
• Capsule B - 100 mg of AZD9496 in a second type of capsule
• Capsule C - 100 mg of AZD9496 in a third type of capsule
• Capsule B - 300 mg of AZD9496
