Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or
other study staff knew what treatment each participant got.
In this study, the participants got either MEDI0382 or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to
help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the drug are
actually caused by the drug.
In this study, both MEDI0382 and the placebo were given through a needle under
the skin, which is called an injection. The MEDI0382 doses were measured in
micrograms, also called μg.
This was also a “dose-escalation” study. This means that the participants who
got MEDI0382 started on a low dose. After the researchers carefully studied the
results, they increased the MEDI0382 doses for these participants.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 2
times over the course of 2 weeks. At these visits, the study doctors checked to
make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• checked the participants’ blood sugar levels
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
