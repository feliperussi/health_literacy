Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems that participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug actually causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary.
Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out
helps protect their identities. The websites listed at the end of this summary may
have other information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate act in the body when taken together in different ways.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate
are planned.
