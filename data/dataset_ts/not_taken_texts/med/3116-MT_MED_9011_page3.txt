Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of male and female adults and adolescents
with severe asthma. The participants in this study were 12 to 80 years old when
they joined.
Before the start of the study, the participants:
> had 2 or more asthma attacks during the last 12 months
> had been taking at least a steroid inhaler plus another treatment to control
their asthma for 3 months or more
The study included 1,061 participants in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
South Africa, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if tezepelumab works in a large
number of participants with severe asthma. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a lung disease that causes the airways to narrow and causes
inflammation in the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have
asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath. Researchers can
check the blood of people with asthma for a certain type of white blood cells
that are a sign of inflammation in the lungs. These white blood cells are known as
eosinophils.
In people with asthma, high levels of eosinophils in the blood mean they are more
likely to have asthma attacks.
