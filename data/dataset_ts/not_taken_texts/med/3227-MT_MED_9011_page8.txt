To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants if their study
treatment helped their symptoms and quality of life. The participants or their
caregivers answered 2 different questionnaires. These were called:
> The Pediatric Quality of Life Sickle Cell Disease Module
> The Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale
The participants or their caregivers also answered surveys that asked about:
> how strong the participants’ pain was during their pain crises
> how many days of school or work they missed because of SCD
> how easy the ticagrelor or placebo tablets were to take
The researchers then scored the participants’ responses to each of the
questionnaires and surveys. They compared the scores between the participants
who took ticagrelor and those who took the placebo.
Overall, the researchers found that the scores were similar between the two
groups. The participants who took ticagrelor and those who took the placebo did
not feel that the study treatment helped their symptoms and quality of life.
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all
of the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
