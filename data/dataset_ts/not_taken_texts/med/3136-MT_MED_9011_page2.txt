Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to stop ovarian cancer from coming back after it
has been treated with chemotherapy. Before a drug can be approved for people to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how well it works and how safe it is.
What treatment did the participants take?
All of the 279 participants in this study took olaparib.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took olaparib, how long did they live with their
cancer before it got worse?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants lived for a median of 9.2
months before their cancer got worse. The median number of months is when
half of the participants are still alive and their cancer hasnâ€™t gotten worse.
X Did the participants have any change in their quality of life when they
took olaparib?
The researchers found that 64.3% of the participants experienced an improved
quality of life at some point during study treatment. This was 160 out of 249
participants. For 42.6% of the participants, their quality of life got worse at
some point during study treatment. This was 106 out of 249 participants.
Participants could have had both an improvement in their quality of life as well
as a worsening while taking olaparib.
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 87.1% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This was
243 out of 279 participants. The most common medical problem was nausea.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
