Average total amount of AZD5718 over time
The average total amount of AZD5718 over time was measured in units called nmol/L per hour,
also known as h•nmol/L. The researchers found that the average total amount of AZD5718 in the
blood over time after each dose was:
• 129.6 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 1 of AZD5718
• 392.7 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 2 of AZD5718
• 1362.0 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 3 of AZD5718
The results for dose 1 of AZD5718 here include only 12 out of the 14 participants. This was
because for 2 participants, the amount of AZD5718 in the blood was too low to be measured.
