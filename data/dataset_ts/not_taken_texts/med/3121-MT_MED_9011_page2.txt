Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with T2D.
The participants in this study were 18 to 65 years old when they joined. The
study included 304 participants in China.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat T2D. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
In people with T2D, the body does not use insulin as well as it should. Insulin is a
hormone that controls the levels of blood sugar, also called “glucose”. T2D can
cause blood glucose levels to rise too high. This can cause medical problems.
Researchers can measure blood glucose levels by looking at a protein in red
blood cells called “hemoglobin”. When red blood cells are carrying glucose, the
hemoglobin changes shape and is called “HbA1c”. Lower levels of HbA1c mean
better control of blood glucose levels.
Dapagliflozin is a drug that may help lower levels of HbA1c by helping the
kidneys remove glucose through the urine. Acarbose is a drug that can help
lower HbA1c and is already approved to treat people with T2D. In this study,
acarbose was used as an “active comparator”. An active comparator is a drug
that is already approved to treat people. In clinical studies, researchers will
sometimes compare how well the study drug works to how well the active
comparator works.
Researchers already did studies that showed that dapagliflozin worked for the
people with T2D who were in those studies. In this study, the researchers wanted
to find out more about how it works.
