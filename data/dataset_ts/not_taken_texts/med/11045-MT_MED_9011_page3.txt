Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order of the treatments each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took both treatments through a metered dose inhaler. A metered dose
inhaler is a device that delivers a certain amount of medicine for the participant to inhale.
The doses of the study treatments were measured in micrograms, also called µg.
Participants took:
• 14.4 µg of GP MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks
• 9.6 µg of FF MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks
The participants took a standard COPD maintenance medicine called Atrovent
HFA for 7 to 21 days before taking the study treatments. This was done so that the
participants would still get a COPD medicine when they stopped taking their usual
COPD medicine. They also took Atrovent HFA between treatments.
If the participants had COPD symptoms that needed treatment right away, they
took Ventolin HFA to relieve their COPD symptoms. This is another standard COPD
maintenance medicine. In this study, it was used as a “rescue medicine” to treat
sudden symptoms of COPD.
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the doctors and nurses did tests to make sure the participants
could join the study. The participants were asked to stop taking certain COPD
medications. This was done so that the researchers could be sure that any effects
seen during the study were due to the study treatment, and not due to other
reasons.
During treatment, each participant was asked to take GP MDI and FF MDI.
First they took GP MDI or FF MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks. After waiting 5 to 21
days, the participants took the other treatment 2 times a day for 2 weeks. This was
done so that the first study treatment they took could leave the body before they
started taking the other treatment. The participants took Atrovent HFA between the
treatment periods to control their COPD.
The doctors and nurses did tests and scans of the lungs to check the participants’
health, breathing, and lungs. They also took blood and urine samples. The participants
answered questions about their smoking, how they were feeling, and what medicines
they were taking.
