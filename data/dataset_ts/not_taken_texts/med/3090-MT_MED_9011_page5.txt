Clinical Study Results
To answer this question, the researchers measured the blood sugar levels and weight of
Group 1 participants before and after study treatment. Then, the researchers compared
these measurements.
The researchers found that:
• The participants who were given MEDI0382 had a 21.5% decrease in blood
sugar levels.
• The participants who were given the placebo had a 6.3% decrease in blood
sugar levels.
• The participants who were given MEDI0382 had a 3.6% decrease in weight.
• The participants who were given the placebo had a 0.2% decrease in weight.
The figure below shows these results.

What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems that both Group 1 and Group 2
participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the
study drug. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
