Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with severe asthma. The participants
had been prescribed benralizumab by their doctors as part of their health care for
their severe asthma. They were about to start their treatment with benralizumab
when they joined the study.
The study included 5 participants in the United Kingdom. Of these, 4 participants
completed the study.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to detect early changes in the well-being
of people with severe asthma who start getting benralizumab.
Researchers already did studies that showed benralizumab worked for the people
with severe asthma who were in those studies. In this study, the researchers
wanted to find out how 3 new smartphone health apps work in detecting these
early changes.
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow and causes
inflammation in the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have
asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
Inflammation in the lungs can lead to high levels of white blood cells called
eosinophils. The study drug, benralizumab, can help get rid of the extra
eosinophils to help control asthma symptoms.
Currently, people taking benralizumab prescribed by their doctors are invited to
fill in questionnaires about their well-being and asthma symptoms. They do this
at a visit with their doctors 4 weeks after getting their first dose of benralizumab.
Changes in well-being that happen before this visit are called “early” changes. If
doctors are able to learn about early changes in well-being, this could improve
health care for people with severe asthma.
