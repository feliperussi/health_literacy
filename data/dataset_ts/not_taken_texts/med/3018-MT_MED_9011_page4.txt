What treatments did the participants get?
This study happened in 2 parts. The researchers planned for there to be 3 parts,
but they stopped the study early because the participants were having medical
problems.
In Part 1, all of the participants got MEDI5083. After getting up to 4 doses of
MEDI5083, some of the participants started getting durvalumab. The results of
Part 1 were used to decide which doses to give in Part 2.
In Part 2, all of the participants got both MEDI5083 and durvalumab at the
same time. After receiving 4 doses of each, the participants continued to receive
durvalumab alone.
The participants got MEDI5083 through a needle under the skin, also known as a
“subcutaneous injection”. They got durvalumab through a needle into a vein, also
known as an “IV infusion”.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
