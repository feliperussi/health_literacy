Clinical Trial Results
How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or needs hospital care. In this study, no participants
developed serious medical problems, and no participants died.
What were the most common non-serious medical problems
in the study?
The table below shows the most common non-serious medical problems
that happened in more than 1 participant in either treatment group
in the study.
Most common non-serious medical problems in this study
Pramlintide and insulin Placebo and insulin
Medical problem (Out of 32 participants) (Out of 28 participants)
Nausea 14 (43.8%) 2 (7.1%)
Headache 8 (25.0%) 1 (3.6%)
Vomiting 6 (18.8%) 0 (0.0%)
Low blood sugar levels 3 (9.4%) 0 (0.0%)
Tremor 1 (3.1%) 2 (7.1%)
Anemia 0 (0.0%) 4 (14.3%)
The low blood sugar category listed above was considered a medical
problem. But, researchers were also interested in how many participants
had even lower blood sugar.
When participants got pramlintide and insulin, 17 out of the 32
participants (53.1%) had lower blood sugar. When participants got the
placebo and insulin, 10 out of the 28 participants (35.7%) had lower
blood sugar.
