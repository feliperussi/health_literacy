Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The website listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during the study.
None of the participants died during the study.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
When participants took the granule form of selumetinib there were 8.3% of participants
who had adverse reactions during the study. This was 2 out of 24 participants. Both
patients had the adverse reaction of dry eyes. The study doctors thought that this
adverse reaction was related to the study drug.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how different forms of selumetinib are taken up by
the body in healthy men.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with selumetinib are planned.
