What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each individual
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatment works best
and is safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

Was the amount of osimertinib in the blood similar for participants with
damaged kidneys and participants with healthy kidneys?
No. The average and highest amounts of osimertinib in the blood were higher in the
participants with damaged kidneys compared to the participants with healthy kidneys.
But, because of the small number of participants in the study, the researchers did not
think these differences were meaningful.
To answer this question, the researchers measured and compared the average and highest
amounts of osimertinib in participants’ blood throughout Part A. The average osimertinib
amount was measured in nanomole hours per liter, also called nmol•h/L. The highest
osimertinib amount was measured in nanomoles per liter, also called nmol/L.
