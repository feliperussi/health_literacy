Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with type 2 diabetes. Before a
drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin and saxagliptin affect the HbA1c levels of the participants?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
that help find out if dapagliflozin and saxagliptin could improve the health of people with
type 2 diabetes who are already taking metformin.
Insulin is a substance that is naturally made by the body. It helps the body use sugar, also
known as glucose, for energy. In people with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make
and use insulin normally. This makes the amount of sugar in the blood too high. High
blood sugar levels can lead to several medical problems.
Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin are drugs that are already approved to treat type 2
diabetes. But some doses of these drugs have not yet been approved to be taken together.
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers measured the levels of HbA1c in
the blood. The HbA1c test measures how much blood sugar is bound to a protein called
hemoglobin, which is found in the red blood cells. Since red blood cells live for about 3
months, the HbA1c test measures the average levels of sugar in the blood for the past
3 months.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with type 2 diabetes who were
already taking metformin for at least 8 weeks before joining the study. Everyone in the
study was 21 to 88 years of age when they joined.
