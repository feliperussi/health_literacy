Clinical Study Results
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants have any DLTs during the study?
• What were the MTDs of the study drugs?
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if the study treatments help improve the health of people
who have relapsed or refractory lymphoma.
What treatments did the participants get?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
This study had 2 parts, called Part A and Part B. Each participant could be in only 1 part.
The participants in Part A got durvalumab and either tremelimumab or AZD9150.
Each of the study treatments was given through a needle into a vein. This is known
as intravenous treatment, also called IV treatment.
The participants who got AZD9150 during Part A started out getting a low dose of
AZD9150. The study doctors carefully reviewed the results for these participants.
Then, they decided whether or not to increase the dose of AZD9150.
The participants in Part B got durvalumab and AZD9150 through IV treatment.
All of the doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram, also called mg/kg.
