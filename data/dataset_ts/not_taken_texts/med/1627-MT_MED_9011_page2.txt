Clinical Trial RESULTS
Whatâ€™s happened since my study ended?
This study started in July 2015 and ended in August 2015. It included
10 participants at 1 study site in the United Kingdom. When the study
ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results.
This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Research studies must be done to show that the drug is safe and
effective, but also to understand how the drug is absorbed, broken
down, and removed from the body. Some cancer medications can be
safely studied using healthy volunteers so that the test results are more
controlled compared to testing in patients. For example, the liver breaks
down many drugs and patients may have diseases or cancer involving
the liver so testing on patients would produce test results which may not
affect other patients.
Researchers in this study tested a drug called osimertinib, which was
developed to treat lung cancer. They wanted to find out how much
of osimertinib reaches the blood in the body when taken as a tablet
compared to when injected directly into the vein. When the drug is taken
by mouth, there is a certain percentage of drug that is not absorbed but
when the drug is injected directly into a vein, 100% of the drug goes in
the blood stream.
