Study Title: A study to learn how sodium zirconium cyclosilicate affects blood
potassium levels in patients who have kidney failure and are
getting hemodialysis
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the drug sodium
zirconium cyclosilicate, also called SZC. All of the participants helped researchers learn
more about SZC to help people who have kidney failure and high levels of potassium in
their blood.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
