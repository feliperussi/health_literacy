What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did SZC affect how many participants could take RAAS inhibitors
without having blood potassium levels that were too high?
No. The researchers found that the differences between the participants who got SZC
and those who got the placebo were small.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the levels of potassium in the
participants’ blood and did other health measurements, such as blood pressure.
Then, they determined whether all of these measurements were in a range that
allowed the participants to get their target dose of RAAS inhibitors.
The researchers calculated how many participants fell into the following 4 categories
after 12 weeks of treatment with SZC or placebo:
• could not take an ACEi, ARB, or ARNI, or could only take less than the target
dose of these drugs, and did not take an MRA
• could take a target dose of an ACEi, ARB, or ARNI, and did not take an MRA
• could take an MRA, but at less than the target dose
• could take an MRA at the target dose
