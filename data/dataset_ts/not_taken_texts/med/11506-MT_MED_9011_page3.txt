Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for more environmentally friendly ways to treat people
who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called “COPD”. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how safe it is and how it works.
COPD is a long-term condition caused by damage to the airways and narrowing
of the airways. This can lead to symptoms such as feeling short of breath,
coughing, and phlegm.
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate are all inhaled drugs
that doctors currently use to help people who have COPD manage their
symptoms. Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate can be given
in combination through different types of inhaler devices. The combination of
these drugs is called “BGF”. One type of inhaler device used to give BGF is a
metered-dose inhaler, also called a “BGF MDI”.
Drugs given through an MDI are carried to the lungs with the help of liquified
gases called “propellants”. These propellants are greenhouse gases that can
contribute to global warming. Researchers are looking for propellants that can be
used to deliver drugs to the lungs without contributing to global warming.
One way of taking budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate is using
an MDI containing a propellant called “HFA”. In this study, the researchers wanted
to compare how much budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate got
into the participants’ blood when taken through BGF MDIs that have HFA or 2
new propellants called “HFC” and “HFO”.
HFA is an approved propellant that is currently used by people with COPD, but
it contributes to global warming. HFC and HFO do not contribute to global
warming as much as HFA. These new propellants would allow people with COPD
to continue taking inhaled treatments, while helping to reduce global warming.
