Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing. But, in people
with ES-SCLC, proteins on the tumor cells can interact with certain proteins on the
immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from recognizing the tumor cells
and being able to attack them.
The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were designed to stop the
tumor cells from interacting with some of these proteins on the immune cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how durvalumab, alone or
together with tremelimumab, worked in participants with ES-SCLC when given
with chemotherapy.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did durvalumab, alone or together with tremelimumab, with chemotherapy
help the participants live longer than chemotherapy alone?
> Did the participants feel that durvalumab, alone or together with
tremelimumab, with chemotherapy affected their symptoms and quality
of life?
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to find out if durvalumab alone
or together with tremelimumab, with chemotherapy, works to help improve the
lifespan of people with ES-SCLC.
What treatments did the participants take?
In the Global Part of this study:
> 268 participants got durvalumab with chemotherapy
> 268 participants got durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy
> 269 participants got chemotherapy alone
