Clinical Trial Results
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem.
Researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study.
These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by
the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
A slightly higher number of participants who got the 1-strain vaccine had medical
problems during the study compared to the number of participants who got the placebo.
No participants stopped taking the drug because of a medical problem.
The table below shows how many participants developed medical problems in the first
7 days and first 14 days of the study.

How many participants developed medical
14 (5.8%) 1 (1.7%)

How many participants had serious medical problems?
A medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or needs hospitalization.
In this study, no participants developed serious medical problems. No participants died
in the study, and no new safety concerns were raised.
What were the most common medical problems in the study that were not
considered serious?
Stuffy nose was the most common medical problem that participants developed in this
study that was not considered serious.
Researchers thought that 13 out of the 18 non-serious medical problems (72.2%) that
happened in the first 14 days after getting treatment were related to the study drug.
The tables below show how many participants developed medical problems that
were not considered serious that happened in the first 7 days and first 14 days after
getting treatment.
