Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of male and female participants with
1 of 2 different types of blood and bone marrow cancer:
X acute myeloid leukemia, also called “AML”
X myelodysplastic syndrome, also called “MDS”
The participants in this study:
X had already tried other treatments for their cancer, but it had come back or
was still getting worse, or
X were not eligible to receive other treatments for their cancer.
The participants in this study were 46 to 89 years old when they joined.
The study included 51 participants in Australia and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer of the blood and bone
marrow. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of
some cells. In healthy people, new blood cells grow in the bone marrow, which is
the soft part inside of some bones. In blood cancers, the blood cells do not form
properly in the bone marrow. These cancer cells then move quickly to the blood.
Acute myeloid leukemia, also called AML, is a blood cancer that affects white
blood cells. Myelodysplastic syndrome, also called MDS, is a bone marrow cancer
that can affect any type of blood cell.
Existing treatments for cancer do not help every patient. The study drug,
AZD2811, was designed to be toxic to cancer cells.
