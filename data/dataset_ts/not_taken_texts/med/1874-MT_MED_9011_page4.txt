How much air could participants exhale after taking different doses
of AZD8871?
The researchers measured how much air the participants could exhale at the
beginning of the study and compared those results to how much they could
exhale after each 14-day treatment period.
In general, the participants could exhale more air after they took AZD8871
compared to when they took the placebo.
On average, the participants:
• could exhale 0.17 more liters of air after taking 100 μg of AZD8871
• could exhale 0.27 more liters of air after taking 600 μg of AZD8871
• could exhale 0.01 more liters of air after taking the placebo
