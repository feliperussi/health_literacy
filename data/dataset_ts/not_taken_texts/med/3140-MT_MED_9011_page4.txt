Clinical Study Results
Did participants’ test results and measurements of safety change during
the study?
Some of the participants’ test results changed during the study, but the changes were
too small for the researchers to know if the study treatments caused the changes.
To answer this question, the doctors looked at the results of these tests:
• vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate
• ECGs
• physical examinations
• blood and urine samples
The doctors did these tests before the participants took the study treatment and
throughout the study.
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of medical problems called “adverse events” that participants
had during the study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom of a medical problem
that participants have. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in
studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study drug.
An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
How many participants had serious adverse events?
None of the participants had a serious adverse event during the study.
How many participants had adverse events?
There were 41.7% of the participants who had an adverse event while taking AZD5718
during the study. This was 10 out of 24 participants.
There were 62.5% of the participants who had an adverse event while taking the
placebo during the study. This was 5 out of 8 participants.
