What happened during this study?
The study started in November 2015 and ended in February 2020.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site.
This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks. At these visits, the study doctors
made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
X took pictures of each participant’s tumors using CT or MRI scans
X took samples of some of the participants’ tumors using a procedure called a
biopsy
X took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were getting study treatment, they visited
their study site up to 10 times in the first cycle and up to 4 times in the second
cycle. After that, they visited up to 3 times every cycle until they stopped study
treatment. At these visits, the participants got AZD2811 and the study doctors
checked their health. Some of the participants also got G-CSF.
After the participants’ last dose of study treatment, they visited their
study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted up to 1 month. At this visit, the
study doctors checked the health of the participants.
Until the end of the study, the participants visited their study site every 6
to 12 weeks, even after they had stopped getting AZD2811. At these visits, the
doctors checked if the participants’ tumors had grown. The doctors also called
the participants who took part in the “dose expansion” part of the study every 12
weeks to check on their health.
