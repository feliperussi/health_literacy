Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did the 3 drugs taken together in different ways act in the body?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if the 3 drugs taken together in different ways can help
improve the health of people with COPD.
COPD is a disease that can cause swelling in the lungs, which can make it difficult
to breathe. Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate are approved
drugs that are taken in an inhaler to treat COPD. In this study, researchers wanted
to learn if these drugs would act differently in the body depending on how people
took them.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
There were 4 treatments in this study. All of the participants took all 4 of the
treatments, but in a different order. The treatments in this study were taken through
an inhaler.
The participants in this study took some of their inhaler treatments with a “spacer”.
Spacers are tubes or masks that are attached to the mouthpiece of inhalers. When
a person uses an inhaler with a spacer, the drug is held inside of the spacer. This
makes it easier to breathe in more of the drug so it ends up in the lungs.
The participants in this study also took some of their inhaler treatments with
charcoal in liquid form through the mouth before and after using the inhaler.
Charcoal stops the study drug from getting into the stomach. Using charcoal in this
study helped the researchers measure the amount of the study drugs that reached
the lungs only.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
