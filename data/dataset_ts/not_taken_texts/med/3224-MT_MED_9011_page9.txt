Clinical Study Results
Airway resistance
When there is less airway resistance in the lungs, breathing becomes easier.
Compared to the start of the study, the researchers found that:
• When the participants took BGF MDI, the airway resistance in their lungs
decreased by an average of 50%.
• When the participants took GFF MDI, the airway resistance in their lungs
decreased by an average of 48%.
