In summary, the researchers found that:
X In the Global group, taking durvalumab together with tremelimumab did
not help the participants live longer compared with standard treatment. The
researchers found that the differences between the 2 treatment groups were
too small to know if durvalumab together with tremelimumab affected how
long the participants lived.
X In the China group, the researchers found that there were some
differences in how long the participants lived after getting durvalumab
with tremelimumab or standard treatment. But, the number of participants
was too small for the researchers to know if durvalumab together with
tremelimumab affected how long the participants lived.
