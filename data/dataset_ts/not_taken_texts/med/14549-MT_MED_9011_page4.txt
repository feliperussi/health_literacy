What is AZD1222?
AZD1222 is a vaccine used to help protect people aged 18 years and older
against COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by a virus called coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
AZD1222 stimulates the body’s natural defenses (immune system). It causes the
body to produce its own protection through antibodies and T cells against the
virus. This could help protect people against COVID-19 in the future. None of the
ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.
How do researchers make AZD1222 and how does it work inside the
body?
There are many different types of vaccines. The vaccine AZD1222 is a “viral
vector” vaccine. This means that genetic information about the protein structure of
SARS-CoV-2 is packaged into a harmless and weakened virus called a viral vector
for the immune system to process. To make AZD1222, the researchers use a type
of common cold virus called “adenovirus” that usually infects chimpanzees but not
humans. It has been made so that it is impossible for this virus to grow in humans
or change our own DNA.
The information that the researchers put inside the weakened viral vector is the
genetic code for the entire SARS-CoV-2 “spike” protein. This is a protein on the
outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that allows it to enter someone’s cells, like a key
to a lock. The spike protein is usually the first part of the virus that comes into
contact with the immune system when someone gets infected. The vaccine does
not contain any other parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cannot cause COVID-19
infection.
