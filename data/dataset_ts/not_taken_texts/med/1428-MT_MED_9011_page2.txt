Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat HNSCC that has come back after
treatment or has spread to other parts of the body. The participants’ cancer could
also not be cured by surgery or radiation therapy. Before a drug can be approved
for people to use as standard treatment, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and if it is effective.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got either:
X Durvalumab with tremelimumab
X Durvalumab alone
X Standard treatment for HNSCC
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live
longer than standard treatment?
The researchers wanted to learn more about how durvalumab affected
participants with a specific type of HNSCC called PD-L1 high cancer. People
with “PD-L1 high cancer” have a large amount of a protein called PD-L1 on the
outside of their tumor cells.
Overall, the researchers found that the participants with PD-L1 high cancer who
got durvalumab alone did not live longer compared with the participants who
got standard treatment.
X Did the participants getting durvalumab with or without
tremelimumab have less severe symptoms and improved
health-related quality of life?
The researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab with
tremelimumab reported having less nausea and mouth pain than the participants
who got the standard treatment. They also found that the participants who got
durvalumab with or without tremelimumab had fewer problems with their taste
and sense of smell than the participants who got standard treatment. There were
no other differences in symptoms between the groups.
