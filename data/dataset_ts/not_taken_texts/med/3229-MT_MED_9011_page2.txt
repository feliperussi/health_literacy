Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have type 2 diabetes
and who are overweight or have obesity. Before a drug can be approved for
patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how
safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how MEDI0382 affects blood sugar
and weight in people who have type 2 diabetes and who are overweight or have
obesity. They also wanted to learn more about the safety of MEDI0382.
In people who have type 2 diabetes, the body does not use insulin as well as it
should. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that controls the levels of sugar
in the blood. If a person’s blood sugar levels become too high, he or she can have
medical problems. High blood sugar can also lead to increased food cravings and
decreased energy levels, which can cause weight gain.
There are treatments for type 2 diabetes that help control blood sugar, but these
treatments may not help control weight gain in some people. The study drug,
MEDI0382, is being developed to help people who have type 2 diabetes control
their blood sugar levels. It was designed to help the body make insulin, control food
cravings, and increase energy levels.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ blood sugar levels?
• Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ weight?
• Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women who had type 2 diabetes and were overweight or had obesity. The
participants in this study were 32 to 77 years old when they joined.
