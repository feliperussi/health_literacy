What happened during this study?
The researchers originally planned for the participants to be in the study for up to
44 weeks. But, because of delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the participants
were in the study for up to 60 weeks. The entire study took 2 years to finish.
The study started in November 2018 and ended in November 2020.
The participants who were still in the study when the COVID-19 pandemic started:
X could get their injections done at home by a healthcare provider so they did
not have to visit their study site
X got study treatment for 44 weeks instead of 28 weeks
X could have a phone call instead of visiting the study site for the final visit
