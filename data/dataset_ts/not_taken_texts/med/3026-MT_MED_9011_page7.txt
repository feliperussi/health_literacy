Deaths due to serious adverse events happened only in Part 2 of the study.
In Part 2, 11.1% of participants who got MEDI3506 died. This was 2 out of
18 participants:
• 1 participant who got MEDI3506 died of a heart attack.
• 1 participant who got MEDI3506 died of lung cancer.
The study doctors did not think these deaths were related to MEDI3506. Both
events happened sometime after the last dose of MEDI3506 was given. Both
participants were current or former smokers, which are known risk factors for heart
attack and lung cancer.
None of the participants who got the placebo in Part 2 died.
