Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI0382. MedImmune, Ltd. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share
the results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in November 2017 and ended in April 2018. The study included
22 participants in the United States at 1 location.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report
of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
The study drug, MEDI0382, is being developed to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes can lead to medical problems, such as heart disease. In people with
heart disease, the body may make too many blood clots. A blood clot is a group of blood
cells that the body makes to stop bleeding. High amounts of blood clots can lead to heart
attacks, strokes, too much bleeding, and other serious medical problems.
In addition, people with type 2 diabetes can also have high blood pressure. Blood
pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels. When this
force is higher than normal in a personâ€™s body, he or she can develop medical problems,
such as having a high heart rate.
