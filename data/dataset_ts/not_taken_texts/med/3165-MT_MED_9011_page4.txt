How did ticagrelor act in the blood?
To find out how a drug acts in the body, researchers measure the amount of the
drug in the blood at different times after participants get treatment.
In this study, the researchers wanted to measure the average amount of
ticagrelor that was in the participants’ blood at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after the
participants got treatment. These amounts were measured in nanograms per
milliliter, also called ng/mL.
The researchers combined the results of these measurements for Group 1 and
Group 2 because the ticagrelor amounts in the blood were similar between the
2 groups.
Group 1 and Group 2 combined results
Overall, the researchers found that after treatment:
• at the end of the first hour, the average amount of ticagrelor in the blood
was 18.6 ng/mL
• at the end of the first 2 hours, the average amount of ticagrelor in the blood
was 21.9 ng/mL
• at the end of the first 4 hours, the average amount of ticagrelor in the blood
was 16.1 ng/mL
• at the end of the first 6 hours, the average amount of ticagrelor in the blood
was 10.3 ng/mL
