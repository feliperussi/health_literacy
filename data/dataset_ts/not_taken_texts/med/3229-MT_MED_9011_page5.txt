Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ blood sugar levels?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got MEDI0382
had a decrease in their blood sugar levels. The researchers also found that the
participants who got the placebo had an increase in their blood sugar levels.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ blood sugar
levels before they got treatment, and at the end of the study. Then, the researchers
compared the percent change in these measurements.
The researchers found that after 7 weeks of treatment, the participants in:
• Group 1, who got the lowest dose, of MEDI0382 had an average decrease in
their blood sugar levels of 39.7%.
• Group 2, who got the middle dose of MEDI0382, had an average decrease in
their blood sugar levels of 31.2%.
• Group 3, who got the highest dose of MEDI0382, had an average decrease in
their blood sugar levels of 37.9%.
• Group 4, who got the placebo, had an average increase in their blood sugar
levels of 2.5%.
