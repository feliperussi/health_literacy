Clinical Study Results
For 14 days before taking study treatment, the participants wore a device to
measure their glucose levels. This was called a continuous glucose monitoring
device, also called a CGM device.
While taking the study treatment, the participants visited the study site 6 times
over 32 days. At the first visit, they stayed overnight. At each visit, the doctors:
• checked the overall health of the participants
• checked their blood pressure
• took blood samples
At home, the participants took their injections once a day in the morning and wore
their CGM device the whole time.
After taking the study treatment, the participants visited their study site 3 times
over 28 days. At these visits, the doctors checked the health of the participants,
took blood samples, and asked about any medical problems.
