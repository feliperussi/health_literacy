Clinical Trial Results
What medical problems did participants have?
This section is a summary of the medical problems participants had during
the study that the doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions.” An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study may or may not be caused
by the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more
information about the adverse reactions that happened in this study.
Even though 42 participants joined this study, only 31 participants completed the
study. Researchers could not always use the information from the participants
who did not finish the study. This means that some of the results in this summary
are only from 31 participants.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants in this study had serious adverse reactions. None of
the participants died during this study.
