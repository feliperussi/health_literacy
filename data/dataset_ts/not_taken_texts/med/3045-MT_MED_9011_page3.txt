Clinical Study Results
A computer program was used to randomly choose the vaccine each participant got.
This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly and that each group is as similar
as possible. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each vaccine is as
accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors did exams to make sure the participants could
join the study. The doctors also made sure the participants did not have the flu.
During the study, the participants visited their study site 11 times. They got 2 doses of
the MEDI3250 vaccine as a nasal spray. The first dose was given on their first visit, and
the second dose was given 28 days later. Each dose was given as 2 sprays. 1 spray was
given into each nostril.
The doctors:
• did exams to check the participants’ health
• collected nasal samples using a swab at all study visits
• took blood samples before each dose and 56 days after the first dose of the vaccine
At each visit and during telephone contacts, the doctors or study site staff asked the
participants’ parents or caregivers about:
• the participants’ health and medical history
• how the participants were feeling
• what medicines the participants were getting
