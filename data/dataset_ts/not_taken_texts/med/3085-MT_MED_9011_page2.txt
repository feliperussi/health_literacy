Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the participants were
taking, but the participants did not.
The participants in this study took either abediterol or a placebo through an inhaler. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make
sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the study treatment are actually
caused by the study treatment.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants took either the abediterol inhaler treatment or the placebo
inhaler treatment once a day for 9 days. Throughout the study, the participants also continued
taking the steroid inhaler treatment they were already taking.
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site 1 more time. During this visit,
the doctors checked the health of the participants again and asked how they were feeling.
