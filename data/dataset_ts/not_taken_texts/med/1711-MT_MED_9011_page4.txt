After the loading doses, the study doctors gave the participants a less frequent
dose of AZD4076 once a week for the rest of the study. This is called a
“maintenance dose”.
It was planned to include another group of participants who would get a higher
dose of AZD4076 after the loading doses. But, the sponsor decided to end the
study early. So, there were only 3 treatment groups.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers studied.
