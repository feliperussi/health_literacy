Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
The main focus of this study was to compare the effects of MEDI0382 given with metformin to
the effects of metformin given with a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure that any of the effects they see in
the participants who get the study drug are caused by the study drug.
Though it was not the main focus of the study, the researchers also wanted to compare the
effects of MEDI0382 given with metformin to the effects of a drug called liraglutide given with
metformin. Liraglutide is a treatment for type 2 diabetes that works by helping the body make
insulin. In previous clinical studies, some people who had type 2 diabetes who took liraglutide
lost weight.
In this study, 612 participants got MEDI0382 through a needle under the skin, also called an
injection. The MEDI0382 doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg.
There were also 110 participants who got liraglutide through an injection. The liraglutide doses
were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
The other 112 participants in this study got the placebo as an injection.
All of the participants continued taking metformin by mouth throughout the study.
For the participants who got MEDI0382 or the placebo, this was a “double-blind” study. This
means none of the participants, doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each
participant got.
For the participants who got liraglutide, this was an “open-label” study. This means the
researchers and the participants knew what the participants were getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the study treatment each participant got. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
