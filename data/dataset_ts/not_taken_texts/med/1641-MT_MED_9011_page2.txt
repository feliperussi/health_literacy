Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with lung cancer. Before
a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how it works and how safe it is.
The body’s immune system can sometimes control cancer growth. But in some
patients with cancer, cancer cells and other cells send signals that stop the body’s
immune system from doing this. Durvalumab is a drug that blocks 1 of these
signals. Researchers are testing therapies like durvalumab to see if blocking these
signals will help the immune system better control cancer growth.
Osimertinib is a drug that targets cancer cells with certain genetic mutations.
Osimertinib blocks a signal that tells these cancer cells to grow and split into new
cancer cells.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of osimertinib
when taken with durvalumab compared to osimertinib alone in patients with lung
cancer.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answer to this question was important to know to help find out if the
combination of osimertinib and durvalumab improved the health of people with
lung cancer. In this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women
who have lung cancers that tested positive for certain genetic mutations. All of
the participants who joined this study had lung cancer that had gotten worse after
treatment with at least 1 other cancer therapy. Everyone in the study was 41 to 80
years old when they joined.
