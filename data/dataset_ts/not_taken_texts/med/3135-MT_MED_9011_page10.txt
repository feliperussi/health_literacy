The study doctors also counted the number of “dose limiting toxicities” the
participants had during the study. A dose limiting toxicity is an adverse event that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant’s dose of
study treatment. A dose limiting toxicity is also known as a “DLT”.
There were 9.4% of participants in Part 1 who had a DLT. This was 3 out of 32
participants.
How much AZD9150 got into the participants’ blood when given in
different ways in Part 2?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples at different times
during the study from the participants in Part 2 and measured how much AZD9150
was in the participants’ blood.
The researchers looked at 2 different measurements of AZD9150 in the blood:
X The average lowest amount of AZD9150 in the blood just before getting
another dose.
X The average total amount of AZD9150 in the blood over time.
Then, the researchers compared the results between the participants in Part 2
who got AZD9150 as an IV infusion and the participants who got AZD9150 as an
injection.
The results shown below are for the participants in Part 2 who got study treatment
and had data that could be calculated. This was:
X 12 participants who got AZD9150 as an injection
X 14 participants who got AZD9150 as an IV infusion
The researchers found that:
X The average lowest amount of AZD9150 in the blood just before getting
another dose was 17% lower for the participants who got AZD9150 as an
injection, compared with the participants who got AZD9150 as an IV infusion.
X The average total amount of AZD9150 in the blood over time was 26%
lower for the participants who got AZD9150 as an injection, compared with
the participants who got AZD9150 as an IV infusion.
