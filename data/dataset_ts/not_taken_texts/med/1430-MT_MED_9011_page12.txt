Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer, also called ES-SCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to
get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Sometimes researchers do a study of a drug in a small number of participants to
decide if they should do a similar study in a larger number of participants.
This small study had 3 groups of participants. Each group got a different
treatment. This summary shows the results from Group 2. The results from
Groups 1 and 3 are in different summaries.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in Group 2 of this study got adavosertib with carboplatin.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for Group 2 in this study
were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participantsâ€™ tumors?
None of the participants in Group 2 had tumors that shrank by at least a third
of its original size after they got adavosertib with carboplatin.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The medical problems that the participants in Group 2 had during this
study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of
participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
