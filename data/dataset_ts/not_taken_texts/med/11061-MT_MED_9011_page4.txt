What happened during the study?
The study started in May 2019 and ended in July 2019.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1
time within a period of 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health
of the participants to make sure they could join the study. The study doctors:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
> took blood and urine samples
While the participants stayed at the study site, the study doctors
repeated most of the tests and measurements done before the participants took
AZD5718. They also took samples of the participants’ faeces during the study. The
participants took a single dose of radioactive AZD5718 on Day 2 of their stay at
the study site.

participants’ health and any medications they were taking.
