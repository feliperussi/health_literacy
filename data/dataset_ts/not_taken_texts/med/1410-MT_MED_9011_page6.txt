What treatments did the participants get
during Part 1?
Participants could enter Part 1 of the study if they had not had an immunotherapy
drug for their HCC before, and had not done well with sorafenib, another
treatment commonly used in advanced HCC. There were 40 participants in Part 1.
All of the participants got durvalumab and tremelimumab. The participants
continued getting study treatment until they left the study or until the study
doctors thought it was no longer helping them.
Part 1 was “open-label”. Open-label means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting.
Durvalumab and tremelimumab were each given as an injection into a vein, also
called an IV infusion. The doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of body
weight, also known as “mg/kg”.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study in Part 1.
Part 1
40 participants
• 20 mg/kg of durvalumab
• 1 mg/kg of tremelimumab
• A combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab
every 4 weeks for 4 doses
• Then, 20 mg/kg of durvalumab once every 4 weeks
What happened during Part 1?
When this summary was made, Part 1 was still ongoing. The participants had been
in the study for up to 51 months. Part 1 started in October 2015.
