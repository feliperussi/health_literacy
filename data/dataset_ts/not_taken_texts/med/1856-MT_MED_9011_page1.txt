Thank you
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for MEDI9197, also called telratolimod. You and all
the other participants helped the researchers learn about using MEDI9197 to help people with
solid tumors or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL.
MedImmune sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results with the
participants and the public. MedImmune reviewed the results of the study when it ended. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with a doctor
or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study included 53 participants in Canada, France, and the United States
Each participant was in the study for up to 12 months. The entire study took place for 36 months
before it was stopped early. The study researchers found that the participants were having a lot
of medical problems and the study results were not as expected. So, the study doctors and the
researchers agreed to end the study early. The study started in November 2015 and ended in
October 2018.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
