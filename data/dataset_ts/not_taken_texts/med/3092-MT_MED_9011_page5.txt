Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced HCC in adults. Before
a treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical trials to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
The extra cells can form tumors. When cancer progresses to a late stage, tumors
spread to other parts of the body or grow beyond the organ where they started.
Sometimes the tumors are too difficult to remove by surgery because of where
they are in the body, or because there are too many of them.
Normally, the immune system can help stop tumors from growing. But, in
people with advanced HCC, the proteins on the tumor cells can interact with
the immune cells. This may stop the immune cells from being able to attack the
tumor cells.
The trial treatments, tremelimumab and durvalumab, were designed to boost
the immune systemâ€™s reaction to HCC tumors. This helps the immune cells attack
the tumor cells, which could stop or slow the growth of the tumor, or shrink it.
