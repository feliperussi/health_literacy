Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants take?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
taking.
It was planned that all of the participants would take both BGF MDI and GFF MDI
at separate times during the study. Some participants would take BGF MDI first
and some participants would take GFF MDI first. They would then take the other
study treatment 3 to 4 weeks later.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order of the treatments
each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible.
The participants took both treatments through a metered dose inhaler. A
metered dose inhaler is a device that delivers a specific amount of medicine for
the participant to inhale. The doses of the study treatments were measured in
micrograms, also called μg.
The participants also took a standard COPD medicine called Atrovent HFA for 7 to
14 days before taking the study treatments. This was done so that the participants
would still get a COPD medicine when they stopped taking their usual COPD
medicine. They also took Atrovent HFA between study treatments.
If the participants had COPD symptoms that needed attention right away, they
took Ventolin HFA to relieve their COPD symptoms. This is another standard
COPD medicine. In this study, it was used as a “rescue medicine” to treat sudden
symptoms of COPD.
