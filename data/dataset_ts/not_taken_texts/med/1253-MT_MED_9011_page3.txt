Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant received. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of
the study. When the study ended, the sponsor found out which treatment the participants
received so they could create a report of the study results.
The participants in this study were given either anifrolumab or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make
sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the study drug are actually
caused by the study drug.
Anifrolumab and the placebo were each given through a needle under the skin, also called
an injection. Doses of anifrolumab were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant was
given. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
There were 4 groups in this study. The table below shows the different groups:
