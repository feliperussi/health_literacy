The doses of normal osimertinib were measured in milligrams, also known as
“mg”. The doses of radio-labelled osimertinib were measured in micrograms, also
known as “µg”.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.

What happened during this study?
The participants could be in the study for up to 15 weeks. But, the entire study
took a little more than 17 months to finish. The study started in October 2018 and
ended in March 2020.
The study was stopped early because the study site closed during the COVID-19
pandemic. So, only 4 of the 8 participants got all of the study treatments. But, the
researchers thought that the data collected was enough to complete the study.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. If all measurements could not be taken during this visit, the participants
visited their study site 1 more time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks.
At these visits, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study.
They also:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
• checked the participants’ blood flow
