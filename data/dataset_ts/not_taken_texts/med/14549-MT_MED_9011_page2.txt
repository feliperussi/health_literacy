Overview
Researchers are studying AZD1222 as a vaccine to prevent the COVID-19
disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also called severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2. The 4 clinical trials described in this summary included
24,422 participants in Brazil, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Each of these
trials compared AZD1222 with a control. The control was either a different vaccine
or salt water. Both AZD1222 and the control were given through 2 injections into
the muscle of the upper arm. In these trials, 2 different dose levels of AZD1222
were given.
The results show that overall, more than 14 days after the participants received
their second injections, AZD1222 was 66.7% effective at preventing symptomatic
COVID-19 confirmed by a positive test. The safety of AZD1222 was similar to
the controls and what researchers already know about the safety of vaccines in
general.
More details about the results of these AZD1222 trials are included later in this
summary. You can also find more information about these trials on the websites
listed on the last page. When full reports of the trial results are available, they can
also be found on those websites.
More results from these trials will be shared when they are available. This includes
looking at how AZD1222 affects participants over time and how it affects older
participants. Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which vaccines
are most effective and are safest. Other trials may provide new information or
different results.
