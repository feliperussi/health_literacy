What medical problems happened during the
study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the
study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse
reaction.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?
There were 4.2% of participants who had adverse reactions during this study. This
was 1 out of 24 participants. This adverse reaction was shaking.
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions.
None of the participants stopped taking study treatment due to adverse reactions.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study was planned to help researchers learn more about how much abediterol
gets in the blood of healthy participants when it was taken through 2 different
nebulizers, or the dry powder inhaler.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with abediterol are not planned.
