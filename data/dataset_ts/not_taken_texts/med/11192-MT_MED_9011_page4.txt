What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did BFF MDI affect how much air the participants could breathe out compared with
BFF DPI?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if BFF delivered through an MDI helps improve the health of
people with long-standing, severe COPD, compared with a DPI.
