Overview
> Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer of the bladder or urinary
system that has spread and cannot be removed by surgery. Before a drug can be
approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works
and how safe it is.
> What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got either:
• MEDI4736 with tremelimumab
• MEDI4736 alone
• Standard chemotherapy
> What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did MEDI4736 with tremelimumab help the participants live longer than
chemotherapy?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got MEDI4736 with
tremelimumab did not live longer compared with the participants who got
chemotherapy.
• Did MEDI4736 alone help the participants with PD-L1 high cancer live
longer than chemotherapy?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got MEDI4736 alone
did not live longer compared with the participants who got chemotherapy.
• Did the participants getting MEDI4736 alone or with tremelimumab have
less severe symptoms?
The researchers found that the participants getting MEDI4736 alone had
less severe symptoms during treatment compared with those getting
chemotherapy. But, they did not find that the participants getting MEDI4736
with tremelimumab had a change in symptoms compared with those getting
chemotherapy.
