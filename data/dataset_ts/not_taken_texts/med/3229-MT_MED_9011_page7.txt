Clinical Study Results
Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the following
tests and measurements. These were done before the study and throughout the
study:
• physical examinations
• blood and urine tests
• ECGs
At the end of the study, the researchers found that there were some changes in
the results of these measurements. But overall, the researchers did not find these
changes to be significant.
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had during
the study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An adverse
event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the adverse events that happened during this study.
