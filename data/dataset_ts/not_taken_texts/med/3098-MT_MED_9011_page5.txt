Clinical Study Results
Did the participants’ blood potassium levels become normal after taking SZC?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that more participants who took SZC had their blood
potassium reach normal levels compared to the participants who took the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ blood potassium
levels throughout the study. Blood potassium levels are measured in millimoles per liter,
also called mmol/L. In this study, the researchers considered normal blood potassium
levels to be between 4.0 mmol/L and 5.0 mmol/L. This is a widely accepted range in the
global scientific community.
The researchers considered a participant’s blood potassium to have reached normal
levels if his or her levels were between 4.0 mmol/L and 5.0 mmol/L at 3 of the 4
hemodialysis visits during the final 4 weeks of treatment. The researchers focused on the
results during this time because the participants who took SZC did not have a change in
their SZC dose during these 4 weeks. The researchers also focused on the participants
who did not need rescue treatment during this time.
The researchers found that during the final 4 weeks of treatment:
• 41.2% of the participants who took SZC and did not need rescue treatment had their
blood potassium reach normal levels. This was 40 out of 97 participants.
• 1.0% of the participants who took the placebo and did not need rescue treatment
had their blood potassium reach normal levels. This was 1 out of 99 participants.
