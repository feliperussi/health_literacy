How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results presented here are from a single study. These results helped the researchers
learn if participants who get constipation from taking opioids for pain not related to cancer
preferred taking naloxegol compared to PEG 3350, and for what reason.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any changes in treatment.
Further clinical studies with naloxegol are planned.
