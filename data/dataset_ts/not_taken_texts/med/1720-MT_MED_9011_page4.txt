3 weeks after the last dose of MEDI4276, the study doctors did a physical exam, took
the participants’ weight, recorded any changes in disease, took a blood sample, recorded vital
signs, checked the participants’ heart health using an ECG, and took pictures of the heart
using an echocardiogram. They repeated these assessments 7 weeks after the last dose of
MEDI4276. About 16 weeks after the last dose of MEDI4276, the study doctors took images of
the participants’ heart and took a final blood sample.
