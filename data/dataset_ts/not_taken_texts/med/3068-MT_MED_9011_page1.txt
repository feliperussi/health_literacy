Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca
Drug Studied: AZD1390
Study Title: A study to learn if AZD1390 can enter the brains of healthy participants
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug AZD1390.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent
non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in October 2017 and ended in January 2018.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat brain tumors. Brain tumors are cancer cells
that grow in the brain. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
The brain is protected by blood vessels that make up the blood-brain barrier, also called the BBB.
The BBB lets some treatments into the brain, but keeps others out. If a treatment cannot cross
the BBB and enter the brain, it might not work. Researchers think that treatments that can cross
the BBB may help treat illnesses in the brain.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did AZD1390 enter the brains of healthy participants?
• Did the participants have any medical problems during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that
help find out if AZD1390 can improve the health of people with brain tumors.
To answer these questions, the researchers asked for the help of healthy participants who did not
have brain tumors.
