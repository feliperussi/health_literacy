Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking.
During the study, the participants took 1 of 2 treatments:
• 80 milligrams, also known as mg, of osimertinib
• 80 mg of osimertinib and 10 milligrams per kilogram, also known as mg/kg,
of durvalumab
Participants took osimertinib in tablet form by mouth once a day. Durvalumab was
given through a needle in the vein every 2 weeks.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the heart health of participants using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG
• took a tumor biopsy sample to test for changes in cancer mutations
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
