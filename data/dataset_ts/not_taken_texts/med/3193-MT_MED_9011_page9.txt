At the end of the main study, the participants were invited to join another part of
the study. During this part of the study, the participants visited the study site once
about 12 to 18 months after the end of the main study. During that visit, the study
doctors checked what treatments the participants had been taking to control their
asthma. The results of that part of the study are not in this summary.
