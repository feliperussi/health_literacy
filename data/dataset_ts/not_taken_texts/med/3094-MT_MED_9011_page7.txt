Clinical Study Results
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
The most common adverse reactions during the study were nausea and vomiting. The
participants who took AZD1775 with food had these adverse reactions about as often as the
participants who took AZD1775 without food.
The table below shows the adverse reactions that happened in at least 2 participants in any
treatment group. There were other adverse reactions, but these happened in fewer participants.

How has this study helped participants and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about AZD1775 and how it works with and without
food in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD1775 are planned.
