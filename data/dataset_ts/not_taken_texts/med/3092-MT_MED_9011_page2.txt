Overview of this trial
Why was the research needed? Page 5
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat hepatocellular carcinoma
in adults. Hepatocellular carcinoma is also known as “HCC”. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical trials
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get? Page 7
The participants in this trial got 1 of the following treatments:
X durvalumab alone
X durvalumab and a higher dose of tremelimumab
X durvalumab and a lower dose of tremelimumab
X standard treatment for HCC
What were the results of this trial? Page 11
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in the trial were:
X Did durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab help the
participants live longer than standard treatment?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got
durvalumab and the higher dose of tremelimumab lived longer
compared with the participants who got standard treatment.
X Did durvalumab alone help the participants live at least as long as
standard treatment?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got
durvalumab alone lived at least as long as the participants who got
standard treatment.
X Did durvalumab alone help the participants live longer than
standard treatment?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were some differences
between the durvalumab and standard treatment groups. But,
the differences were too small for the researchers to decide if
durvalumab alone helped participants live longer than standard
treatment.
