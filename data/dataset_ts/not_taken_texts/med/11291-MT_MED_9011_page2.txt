Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in
this study were 20 to 50 years old when they joined.
The study included 24 participants in Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic kidney disease, also
known as CKD. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
The study drug, verinurad, is being developed as a treatment for CKD. It
decreases blood levels of uric acid by helping the kidneys to excrete the uric acid
from the blood into the urine, instead of reabsorbing it. Uric acid is a chemical
made by the body. Researchers think that levels of uric acid that are too high in
the blood may increase the risk of CKD. They think that limiting the amount of uric
acid that is taken back up in the kidneys may help people with CKD.
When someone has too much uric acid in their blood and takes verinurad alone,
there is a risk that the extra uric acid can form crystals in the kidneys. These
crystals can damage the kidney. So, verinurad is taken together with a type of drug
that decreases the amount of uric acid that the body makes. This means that when
the drugs are taken together, there is less uric acid in the kidneys and a lower risk
that crystals are formed in the kidneys. A drug that decreases the amount of uric
acid made by the body is called allopurinol. It is an approved drug that has been
used in other clinical studies with verinurad.
Before larger studies with verinurad can be done in participants with CKD,
the researchers needed to learn how verinurad affects how the heart beats.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if the amount of verinurad in the
participantsâ€™ blood affected how the heart beats. The participants in this study also
took allopurinol.
