What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the study results.
There were 4 participants in Part 1, and 2 participants in Part 2, who did not get
any doses of study treatment. So, the results below are for 32 participants in Part 1
and 40 participants in Part 2.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during Part 1 of the
study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements
throughout Part 1.
The doctors did physical exams and tested the participants’ blood and
urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check the
participants’ heart health. Overall, the researchers found that there were some
small changes in the results of these tests and measurements. But, the researchers
did not consider these changes to be meaningful.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
