What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and
after the participants got AZD2811. The doctors did physical exams and tested
the participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall health. They also
did ECGs to check the participants’ heart health.
Overall, the researchers found that some of the participants did have some
changes in their blood tests after getting treatment. Some measurements were
too high, and some were too low.
The measurements that were too high were:
X Liver proteins called ALT, AST, and ALP
X Blood sugar
X A protein called bilirubin that is made when red blood cells break down. High
levels of bilirubin could be a sign of liver damage.
X A protein called creatinine that is made by muscles when they move. High
levels of creatinine could be a sign of kidney damage.
