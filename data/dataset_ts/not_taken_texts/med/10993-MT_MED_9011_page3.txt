What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> How much of the combined inhaled study drugs reached the lungs?
> What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know so that researchers can
learn more about how combined doses of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate act in the body of people who have COPD.
What treatments did the participants take?
The researchers in this study wanted to learn how much of a combined inhaled
treatment of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate reached
the lungs in participants with COPD. They also wanted to compare these results
between participants with moderate COPD and participants with severe or very
severe COPD. COPD is called moderate, severe, or very severe depending on
how much it affects a person’s breathing.
In this study, there were 2 groups of participants. Both groups took budesonide,
glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate through an inhaler. The groups were
based on how severe the participants’ COPD was:
> 10 participants had moderate COPD
> 8 participants had severe or very severe COPD
Each group took the same doses of the study drugs during the study. The doses
were measured in micrograms, also called μg. Each participant took 1 dose of
the study drug.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
