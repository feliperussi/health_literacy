Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of Asian men and women with T2DM who
were already taking metformin but were still not able to control their blood
sugar levels. The participants in this study were 31 to 73 years old when they
joined.
The study included 49 participants in Vietnam and Thailand. The researchers
also planned to include participants from China. But, the study was stopped
early before any participants in China joined.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat people who have T2DM who
are not able to control their blood sugar levels, even with treatment. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how it works and how safe it is.
In people with T2DM, the body does not make enough insulin or does not use
insulin as well as it should. Insulin controls the level of blood sugar, which is also
called glucose. T2DM causes blood glucose levels to rise higher than normal.
This can cause medical problems.
Doctors can measure average levels of blood glucose by looking at a protein in
red blood cells called hemoglobin. In people with T2DM, extra glucose in the
blood attaches to hemoglobin, creating a protein called HbA1c. Lower levels of
HbA1c mean lower blood glucose levels.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how dapagliflozin, saxagliptin,
and metformin affected HbA1c levels in Asian participants with T2DM when
taken together. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
