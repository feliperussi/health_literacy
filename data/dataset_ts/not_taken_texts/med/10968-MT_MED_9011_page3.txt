Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with early stage non-
small cell lung cancer, also known as “NSCLC”. Early stage NSCLC meant that
the cancer was under 5 centimeters in size and had not spread beyond the
lymph nodes. The participants all had NSCLC that the study doctors thought
could be removed by surgery. Also, none of the participants had any other type
of treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for their cancer before the
study. The participants in this study were 51 to 87 years old when they joined.
The study included 84 participants in Canada, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain,
Switzerland, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat NSCLC. Before a drug can be
approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works
and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab, alone or in
combination with oleclumab, monalizumab, or danvatirsen, works in participants
with early stage NSCLC. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems, called adverse reactions, during the study.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells.
These “extra” cells can form tumors. NSCLC is a type of lung cancer.
Normally, the immune system fights infections or anything it does not recognize,
and can help stop tumors from growing or surviving. But in some people with
NSCLC, proteins on the tumor cells can interact with certain proteins on the
immune cells. This stops the immune cells from attacking the tumor cells.
