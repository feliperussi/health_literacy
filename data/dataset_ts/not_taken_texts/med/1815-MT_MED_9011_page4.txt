Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments
work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
A full list of the questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the
websites listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is
available, it can also be found on these websites.
What was the maximum tolerated dose of AZD1775 for the
participants?
In this study, the researchers wanted to find the “maximum tolerated dose” for
AZD1775. The maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose of a drug that doesn’t
cause “dose-limiting toxicities”, also called DLTs, in participants. A DLT is a medical
problem that is severe enough to stop the researcher from increasing a participant’s
study drug dose. The researchers also wanted to find out how often participants
could take the AZD1775 maximum tolerated dose without developing DLTs.
In general, the researchers found that:
• Participants in Groups 1 and 2 had a maximum tolerated dose of 125 mg twice
a day for AZD1775.
• Participants in Groups 3 through 10 had a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg
once a day for AZD1775.
• The overall maximum tolerated dose in the study was 300 mg once a day
for AZD1775, taken for the first 5 days of weeks 1 and 2 during the 3-week
treatment cycle.
The researchers also wanted to know how many DLTs participants had. There
were 2 participants who died before receiving enough of the treatment for
researchers to be able to study their DLT results. One of these participants was
in Group 4, and 1 of these participants was in Group 7. So, the researchers could
only study the DLT results for 60 of the 62 participants.
