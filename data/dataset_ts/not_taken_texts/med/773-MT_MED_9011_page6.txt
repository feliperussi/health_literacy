Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had
during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”. An adverse event is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital
care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the study drugs.
The table below shows how many participants had adverse events during the study.
