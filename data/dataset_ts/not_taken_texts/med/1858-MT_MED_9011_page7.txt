Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So, when
new drugs are studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have
during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”. They may or may not
be caused by the study drug.

problems. The AZD9567 group in the table below includes all participants who took
AZD9567, no matter which dose they got. No participants stopped taking the study drug
because of a medical problem.
