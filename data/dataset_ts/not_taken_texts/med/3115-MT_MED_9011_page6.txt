Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had
might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers wanted to
answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. When a full report of the
study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor
before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant who left the study before completing Part 2. The study doctors were also
not able to use the results from 3 other participants. So, the results below include 22 out of 26
participants.
Did dapagliflozin affect the amount of glucose that left the participants’ blood?
No. Overall, the researchers found that compared with the placebo, dapagliflozin did not affect
the amount of glucose that left the participants’ blood.
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the rate at which glucose left the
participants’ blood after they took study treatment for 5 weeks. This is called the “glucose
disposal rate”. The glucose disposal rate is measured in micromoles per kilogram body weight
per minute, also known µmol/kg body weight/min.
The study doctors measured the glucose disposal rate after Part 1 and after Part 2 for each
participant. Then, they calculated the average for all of the participants. The study doctors
compared the results when the participants took dapagliflozin to the results when they took the
placebo.
The researchers found that the average glucose disposal rate was similar between the study
treatments:
• 8.52 µmol/kg body weight/min when the participants took dapagliflozin
• 9.59 µmol/kg body weight/min when the participants took the placebo
