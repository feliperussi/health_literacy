How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how MEDI0382 affects the blood sugar
levels and weight of overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with MEDI0382 are planned.
