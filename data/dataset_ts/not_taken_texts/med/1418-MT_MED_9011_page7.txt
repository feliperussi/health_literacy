Did the study drugs affect how the participants felt about their health?
No. In all 3 treatment groups, the participants had very little change in how they felt about their
health.
To answer this question, the researchers gave the participants surveys throughout the study that
asked them how they were feeling. Each time the participants took a survey, they got a score
based on their responses. Overall, the participants’ survey scores did not change very much
throughout the study. The survey scores were similar between participants in the 3 treatment
groups. This meant that the participants had very little change in how they felt about their health.
What medical problems did the participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may be related to cancer, the study drugs, or neither. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
