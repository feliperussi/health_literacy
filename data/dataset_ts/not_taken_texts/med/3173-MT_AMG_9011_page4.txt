5. Which medicines [or vaccines] were studied?
What medicinal products were studied?
 Patients received denosumab as an injection under the skin or zoledronic acid given
as an infusion into a vein.
 Neither the patient nor the study doctor could choose whether they received
denosumab or zoledronic acid. Patients agreed to be put into one of two treatment
groups (the denosumab group or the zoledronic acid group) by chance (randomised).
This is like flipping a coin or drawing numbers out of a hat, and there is an equal
chance of being placed in either group.
 The different ways denosumab and zoledronic acid are given (denosumab as an
injection under the skin and zoledronic acid as an infusion into a vein) would have told
the patient, the study doctor and the study staff which treatment the patient was being
given.
 If the patient, the study doctor or the study knew which treatment the patient was
being given they might have changed their behaviour on the study. This could have
influenced the results of the study.
 To stop this from happening, patients randomised to receive denosumab also received
a placebo infusion (which did not contain any medicine), and patients randomised to
receive zoledronic acid also received a placebo injection (which did not contain any
medicine). This is shown in Figure 2. devorppA
 These steps ensured that neither the patient nor the study doctor nor his/her study
staff knew which treatment the patient was receiving until after the study was over.
