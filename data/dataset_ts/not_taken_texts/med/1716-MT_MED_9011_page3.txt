Clinical Study Results
In Part B of this study, the participants were given either MEDI0382 or a placebo
as an injection under the skin. A placebo looks like the drug but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they
see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
was given. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is
as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors did a physical examination to make sure
the participants could join the study. They also took blood and urine samples and
checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG.
During Part B of the study, the participants were given either MEDI0382 or a
placebo once a day as an injection under the skin.
The participants getting MEDI0382 were given the below treatments in order:
• 100 micrograms, also called μg, for 4 days at their study site
• 150 μg for 4 days at their study site
• 200 μg for 4 days at their study site
• 200 μg for 28 days at home
• 200 μg for 1 day at their study site
The participants getting the placebo were given their treatment in the same way as
the participants who were given MEDI0382.
At the end of Part B of the study, the participants visited their study site for a
follow-up examination so the doctors could check their health again.
