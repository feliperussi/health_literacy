What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study vaccine.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study vaccine. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a vaccine causes an adverse reaction. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during the study.
