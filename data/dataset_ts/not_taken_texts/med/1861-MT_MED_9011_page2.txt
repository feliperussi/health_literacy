Clinical trial results
What has happened since my study ended?
Your study started in June 2016 and ended in November 2016. The study
included 30 participants at 4 study sites in Germany. When the study
ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results.
This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a new drug can be approved, research must be done to show that
it is safe and effective. The first step in studying a new drug is to test it in
healthy people or in people without any serious health problems. The next
step is to do research studies in people with health problems, also known
as participants.
The study drug, abediterol, is being developed to treat asthma. Asthma
is a lung disease that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and
difficulty breathing. Researchers wanted to know:
• How did abediterol affect the body?
• How did abediterol act in the body?
• How much of abediterol reached the blood?
• What medical problems did participants have after getting abediterol?
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that neither the study
staff nor the participants knew what treatment each participant got.
Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment each
participant is getting can affect the results of the study. This way, the
results are looked at fairly.
In this study, all participants got inhaler treatments of abediterol and a
placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine
in it. Researchers use placebos in studies to compare the results for
participants who get study drugs with the results for participants who get
no medicine at all. There were 5 inhaler treatments of abediterol and 1
inhaler treatment of placebo in this study.
Your study included 30 men and women with asthma who were 32 to 71
years old.
