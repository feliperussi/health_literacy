Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, also called COPD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do
clinical studies to figure out how it works and how safe it is.
COPD is a long-term condition caused by damage and narrowing of the airways. This can lead to
symptoms such as difficulty breathing, phlegm, and coughing.
There are several inhaled treatments that help people manage their COPD symptoms. But these
treatments may not work for some people and may cause medical problems.
The study drug, AZD8871, is being developed as an inhaled treatment to help people who have
COPD manage their symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to compare AZD8871 to a COPD treatment called Anoro
Ellipta and to a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the study drug are actually caused by the study drug.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did AZD8871 help the participants breathe more easily?
• Did AZD8871 help the participants manage their COPD symptoms?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women who
have COPD. The participants in this study were 47 to 80 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other study staff
knew which treatments the participants took. Some studies are done this way because knowing
what treatments the participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study
ended, the research sponsor found out which treatments the participants took so they could
create a report of the study results.
In this study, all the participants took 3 inhaled treatments: AZD8871, Anoro Ellipta, and the
placebo.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the participants took
each treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
