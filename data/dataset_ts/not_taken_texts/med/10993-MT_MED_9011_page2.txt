Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. The participants in this study were 46 to 78 years old when
they joined.
The study included 18 participants in the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD. Before a drug or a
combination of drugs can be approved for people to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
COPD is a long-term condition caused by damage to and narrowing of the
airways. This can lead to symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and
phlegm.
There are treatments that help people manage their COPD symptoms. But,
these treatments may not work for some people. They may also cause medical
problems for some people.
The study drugs, budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate, are
each inhaled treatments that doctors currently use to help people who have
COPD manage their symptoms. But, these study drugs are not available
combined in the same inhaler. Researchers think that combined inhaled
treatments of these study drugs may help people who have COPD to better
manage their symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how budesonide, glycopyrronium,
and formoterol fumarate reach the lungs when they are delivered through
1 inhaler in participants who have COPD. This information may help researchers
find out which combined treatments to give to future study participants.
