How did the participants’ immune systems respond to MEDI7510?
The researchers also wanted to learn how the participants’ immune systems
responded to MEDI7510. So, the researchers took blood samples:
• before vaccination
• about 1 month after vaccination
• during the last study visit
The researchers also took blood samples on about Day 4 and Day 22 if the participants
had a respiratory illness.
Some of the participants gave additional blood about 1 week after dosing. These
blood samples were used to study the body’s immune response to the vaccine.
The researchers learned that the vaccine did cause an immune response in the body
of most of the participants who were in this study. But, that immune response did not
protect them from illness.
