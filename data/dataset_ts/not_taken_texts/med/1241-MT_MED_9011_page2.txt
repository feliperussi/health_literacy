Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are trying to find out how benralizumab works in the body. Before a
treatment can be approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
treatment but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did benralizumab affect the participants’ allergic responses in
their lungs?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that benralizumab did affect some of the
participants’ allergic responses in their lungs compared with the placebo.
> Did benralizumab affect the amount of air the participants could
breathe out after an allergic trigger?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes
in the amount of air the participants could breathe out in both groups of
participants. But, these changes were too small for the researchers to know if
benralizumab affected the participants’ breathing compared with the placebo.
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 8.7% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The
most common medical problem was migraine. More details about the results
of this study are included later in this summary.
