Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drugs Studied: Durvalumab and tremelimumab
Study Title: A study to learn how durvalumab or durvalumab in combination with
tremelimumab acts in the blood of Chinese patients with advanced
solid tumors
Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drugs
durvalumab and durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the
study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
This study started in December 2016. There are 2 parts in this study, called Part A and
Part B. Part A of the study is still ongoing. Part B of the study was canceled before it
started. Part A of the study included 26 participants in China.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected during Part A and created a report of the results.
This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with advanced solid tumors,
which is a form of cancer that grows as lumps. Before a drug can be approved for
patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
When cancer develops in the body, the body’s immune system can sometimes control
cancer growth. But in some patients with cancer, cancer cells and other cells send
signals that stop the immune system from doing this. Durvalumab is a drug that blocks
one of these signals. Tremelimumab is a drug that blocks another one of these signals.
Researchers are testing these treatments to see if blocking the signals will help the
patient’s immune system to control cancer growth.
