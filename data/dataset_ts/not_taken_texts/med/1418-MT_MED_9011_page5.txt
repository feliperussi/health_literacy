Clinical Study Results
Did the participants who received the study drugs live longer compared to the
participants who received SOC treatment?
No. Overall, the participants in Group 1 and Group 2 did not live longer after starting treatment
compared to the participants in Group 3.
To answer this question, the researchers studied the percentage of participants who were still
alive at different time points throughout the study. They also studied the number of participants
who died. The researchers recorded these results until about 2 years after the participants
started treatment.
The researchers found that:
6 months after starting treatment
• 52.9% of participants in Group 1 were still alive
• 58.0% of participants in Group 2 were still alive
• 66.1% of participants in Group 3 were still alive
12 months after starting treatment
• 30.4% of participants in Group 1 were still alive
• 37.0% of participants in Group 2 were still alive
• 30.5% of participants in Group 3 were still alive
18 months after starting treatment
• 21.0% of participants in Group 1 were still alive
• 25.4% of participants in Group 2 were still alive
• 17.8% of participants in Group 3 were still alive
24 months after starting treatment
• 13.3% of participants in Group 1 were still alive
• 18.4% of participants in Group 2 were still alive
• 10.3% of participants in Group 3 were still alive
