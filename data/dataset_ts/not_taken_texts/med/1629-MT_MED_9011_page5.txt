What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took osimertinib as a tablet by mouth once a
day. The standard dose of osimertinib was 80 milligrams, also known as “mg”, but
the participants could take a lower dose if the study doctors thought they needed
to. The participants continued to take osimertinib for as long as the study doctors
thought it was helping them or until they left the study.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
