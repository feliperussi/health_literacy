Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants get?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors,
and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
All of the participants got durvalumab and tremelimumab through a needle into a vein,
also known as an IV infusion. They also got standard chemotherapy treatments by IV
infusion throughout the study.
The researchers planned to study 7 different treatment groups, but participants only
joined 6 of the groups. The groups were chosen based on the types of tumors the
participants had, and the type of chemotherapy they received.
The doses of durvalumab and tremelimumab were based on which group the participants
were in. They were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
The participants got treatment in periods called cycles. The participants got 1 dose of
durvalumab and tremelimumab in each cycle. The participants in Group 4 got 2 doses of
chemotherapy in each cycle and the other groups got 1 dose in each cycle.
Most participants were planned to be in the study for up to 4 cycles. The participants in
Group 6 were planned to be in the study for up to 6 cycles.
