This study had 2 parts. Participants were in either Part 1 or Part 2 of the study.
In Part 1 of the study, the study doctors used the results to help them choose
the right dose of capivasertib for the participants of Part 2 to take. The results
showed that the dose used in Part 1 did not cause too many medical problems,
so the same dose was used in Part 2 without the need to test other doses of
capivasertib.
Each week in both parts of the study, the participants took capivasertib 2 times
a day every day for 4 days and then did not take it for 3 days. Abiraterone and
steroid tablets were taken every day. The participants carried on taking ADT.
The participants took the study treatments in 4-week periods called “cycles”.
The participants were in the study until their cancer got worse, the study doctors
thought they should stop taking study treatment, or they left for another reason.
Because all of the participants took the same doses of capivasertib and
abiraterone, their results will be presented together as a single group. The chart
below shows the treatments the participants took.
