Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with T2DM and heart
failure. The participants in this study were 38 to 88 years old when they joined.
The study included 348 participants in 10 countries. These were Bulgaria, Canada,
Chile, Hungary, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United
States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers already did studies that showed saxagliptin worked for the people
with T2DM who were in those studies. In this study, the researchers wanted to find
out more about how saxagliptin works and if it has any effect on the heart.
In people with T2DM, the body does not use insulin as it should. Insulin controls
the level of blood sugar, which is also called glucose. T2DM causes blood glucose
levels to rise and be higher than normal. This can cause medical problems. In
some cases, high blood glucose levels can cause changes in the heart muscle,
leading to heart failure. Saxagliptin is used as a treatment for T2DM. It works by
helping the body make and use insulin properly.
There are treatments for T2DM, but sometimes these treatments can make heart
failure symptoms worse. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out whether
saxagliptin affected how well the participantsâ€™ hearts worked.
Sitagliptin is another T2DM treatment. It works in the same way as saxagliptin and
has been shown to not make heart symptoms worse. In this study, the researchers
also wanted to learn more about the safety of saxagliptin and sitagliptin compared
with placebo.
