How many participants’ tumors shrank after treatment with MEDI0457
and durvalumab?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ tumors before
the start of study treatment, then every 8 weeks until they left the study, to find
out if treatment with MEDI0457 and durvalumab shrank participants’ tumors.
There were 6 participants who did not get a dose of both study treatments, or
who did not have cancer confirmed to be caused by HPV. The results for these
participants were not included.
The researchers found that tumors shrank in:
X 27.6% of participants. This was 8 out of 29 participants.
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for MEDI0457 and durvalumab.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
