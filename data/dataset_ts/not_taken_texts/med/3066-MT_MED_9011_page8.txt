Did any dose-limiting toxicities happen during the study?
The researchers found that there were dose-limiting toxicities during the study.
A dose-limiting toxicity is a medical problem that is serious enough to stop the
study doctor from increasing a participantâ€™s dose of study treatment or give this or
higher doses of study treatment to future study participants.
Overall, the researchers found that there were 10.4% of participants who had
dose-limiting toxicities. This was 7 out of 67 participants. Some of the participants
had more than 1 dose-limiting toxicity.
None of the participants who had AML had dose-limiting toxicities.
There were 18.2% of participants who had DLBCL who had dose-limiting
toxicities. This was 4 out of 22 participants. These dose-limiting toxicities were:
> decrease in the number of platelets in blood, which means the body cannot
stop bleeding as well as it should
> decrease in the number of neutrophils
There were 16.7% of participants who had MM who had dose-limiting toxicities.
This was 3 out of 18 participants. These dose-limiting toxicities were:
> decrease in the number of platelets in blood
> decrease in the number of neutrophils
> swelling in the prostate
The researchers studied dose-limiting toxicities because they wanted to find
the maximum tolerated dose of MEDI7247. This is the highest dose that does
not result in a high percentage of dose-limiting toxicities. Because there was a
small number of participants who had dose-limiting toxicities in this study, the
researchers were not able to find out the maximum tolerated dose for MEDI7247.
