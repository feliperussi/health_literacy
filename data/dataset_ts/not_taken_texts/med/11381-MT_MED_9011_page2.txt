Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in this study
were 22 to 39 years old when they joined.
The study included 6 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart disease. Before a drug
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
When the body makes too much of a protein called myeloperoxidase, it can
sometimes be a factor in causing heart disease. Myeloperoxidase is also called
“MPO”.
AZD4831 may be able to help reduce the levels of MPO in the body. Having
a lower amount of MPO may help improve the health of patients with heart
disease.
