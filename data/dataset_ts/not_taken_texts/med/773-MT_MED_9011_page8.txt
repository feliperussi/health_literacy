Clinical Study Results
Adverse reactions
This section is a summary of the adverse events the participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These adverse events are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care. These adverse reactions may or may not
be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions shown in the sections below are also included in the adverse events
sections above. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
the adverse events and adverse reactions that happened during this study.
The table below shows how many participants had adverse reactions during the study.
