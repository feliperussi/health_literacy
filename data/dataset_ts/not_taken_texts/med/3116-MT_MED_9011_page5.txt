A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got tezepelumab or the placebo through a needle under the
skin. This is also known as an injection. The dose of tezepelumab was measured in
milligrams, also known as mg.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
