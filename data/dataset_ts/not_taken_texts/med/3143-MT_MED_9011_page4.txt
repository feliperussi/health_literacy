results.
Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
No. Overall, the participants’ safety results did not change during the study.
To answer this question, the researchers performed tests throughout the study.
Then, they compared the results for the participants who took AZD9977 to the
results for the participants who took the placebo. The study doctors:
• performed physical examinations and checked participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples from the participants
• checked participants’ heart health using an ECG
Overall, the participants who took AZD9977 and the participants who took the
placebo had some changes in their test results during the study. But, these changes
were too small for the researchers to consider them meaningful.
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers recorded any medical problems the
participants had during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse
events”. An adverse event is any medical problem that happens during the study.
Adverse events are considered “serious” when they are life-threatening, cause
lasting problems, or require hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be
caused by the study drug.
What serious adverse events did participants have?
None of the participants had serious adverse events during the study.
None of the participants died during the study.
How many participants had adverse events?
There were 22.2% of participants who took AZD9977 who had adverse events
during the study. This was 4 out of 18 participants.
