Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
adavosertib, also called AZD1775.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the
study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in December 2017 and ended in January 2019. The study was stopped
early by the study researchers because not enough participants could be included in the
study. The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 33 participants in the United States.
