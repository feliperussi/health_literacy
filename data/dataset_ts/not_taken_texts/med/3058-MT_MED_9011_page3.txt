Clinical Trial RESULTS
What happened during the study?
There were 28 participants in this study. All participants were healthy adults
between the ages of 18 and 65 years.
Before participants stayed at the study site, study doctors did a physical exam,
took blood and urine samples, and asked about participants’ medical history
to make sure they could participate in the study. They checked participants’
blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Study doctors also did an
electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check participants’ heart health
Participants stayed at the study site up to 26 days. Study doctors checked
participants’ blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Study doctors
also took blood samples to measure the amount of lesinurad and allopurinol
in the blood.
There were 4 groups in the study. Participants were assigned to groups by
chance, like rolling dice.
Participants took study drugs on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22. On
each of these days, they took either Dose A or Dose B:
• Dose A: One combined 200/300-milligram (mg) tablet
of lesinurad/allopurinol given with food
• Dose B: One 200-mg tablet of lesinurad and one 300-mg
tablet of allopurinol given with food
Each participant took Dose A twice and Dose B twice over those 4 days. The
order that the doses were taken was different for each group. The order that each
participant took the doses was decided by chance.
Participants stayed at the study site from Day 1 to Day 26. They went back to
the study site for a follow-up visit around Day 29, about a week after their last
dose of study drug. At this last visit, study doctors did a physical exam, took
blood and urine samples, and did an ECG to check your health. Study doctors
also asked questions about any medical problems participants were having and
other drugs they were taking.
