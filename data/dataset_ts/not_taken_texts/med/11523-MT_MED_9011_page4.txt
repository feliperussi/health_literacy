What treatments did the participants
take?
In this study, all of the participants took acalabrutinib.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
21 participants
Acalabrutinib as a tablet by mouth
Acalabrutinib twice a day
For up to 1 year
Participants could stay in the study for more than 1 year, for as long as the study
doctors thought treatment was helping them, or until the participant’s cancer
got worse.
