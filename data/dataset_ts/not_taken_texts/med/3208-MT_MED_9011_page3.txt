Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took BGF, the doctors checked their overall health to
make sure that they could join the study. This included:
• taking blood and urine samples
• lung function tests
• heart health tests using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The participants also learned how to use the inhaler to take BGF.
During the study, the participants visited the study site 2 times. They stayed
overnight each time. At each visit:
• the participants took 2 inhaler puffs of BGF
• the doctors checked the participants’ health
• the doctors took scans of the participants’ lungs
After taking BGF at each visit, the participants were asked to hold their breath.
In 1 part of the study, they held their breath for 3 seconds. In the other part of
the study, they held their breath for 10 seconds. The order that each participant
completed each part was chosen randomly. By the end of the study, each
participant had completed both parts.
The participants waited about 7 days in between taking study treatment in each
part. This was done so that all of the BGF could leave their bodies before they
took it again.
After the participants took BGF, the doctors called the participants 7 to 14
days after their last dose of BGF to check on their health.
