What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> How many participants had successful tezepelumab injections?
> Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped them control their asthma?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if tezepelumab helps improve the health of people with asthma.
What treatments did the participants take?
This was an “open-label” study. This means that all of the participants, their caregivers,
the researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew that all the participants were
getting tezepelumab. They also knew which injection device each participant was
using.
In this study, all of the participants got tezepelumab through a needle under the skin.
This is also known as an injection. The participants got the same dose of tezepelumab
through 1 of 2 different injection devices. The participants got some of these injections
from the study staff at the study site. The participants or their caregivers also did some
of these injections themselves at home and at the study site.
There were 2 groups of participants. The first group got an injection through a pre-
filled syringe. This syringe had a plunger at its top and a protective layer around the
needle. This type of syringe is known as an “accessorized pre-filled syringe”. Doctors
use accessorized syringes to increase the safety of a syringe and reduce the chance of
injury.
The second group of participants got an injection through an “autoinjector”.
Autoinjectors are devices that deliver injections by a button push or by pressing the
device against the injection site.
