What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did olaparib help the participants live longer with their cancer before it got
worse?
> Did olaparib help the participants’ pain and health-related quality of life?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if olaparib helps improve the health of people with mCRPC.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took either olaparib, enzalutamide, or abiraterone
acetate. Enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate are each a type of treatment called
a “new hormonal agent”, also known as an NHA. Both of these treatments are
already available for the treatment of mCRPC.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose if the participants took
olaparib or 1 of the NHA treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen
fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible. For the participants who took 1 of the NHA treatments,
the study doctors decided if each participant took enzalutamide or abiraterone
acetate.
Each of the study treatments was taken as a tablet by mouth. The doses were
measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
