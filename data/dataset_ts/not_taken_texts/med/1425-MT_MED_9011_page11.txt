In the China Group:
Overall, the researchers found that there were some differences in how long the
participants lived after getting durvalumab with tremelimumab or the standard
treatment. But, the number of participants was too small for the researchers to
know if durvalumab together with tremelimumab helped the participants live
longer.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of months the
participants lived from the start of treatment. The researchers looked at the data
collected until September 2020 to calculate the average number of months the
participants lived.
The researchers were most interested in studying treatment in a group of
participants who had a specific type of tumor. The researchers thought
that the participants with this type of tumor might benefit from treatment more
than others. There were 55 participants with this type of tumor. The results below
are for 26 of the participants who got durvalumab together with tremelimumab,
and 29 of the participants who got the standard treatment.
The researchers found that the participants lived an average of:
X 15.0 months after getting durvalumab together with tremelimumab
X 11.7 months after getting the standard treatment
The researchers also studied how long all of the participants from the China
group lived after getting durvalumab with tremelimumab or the standard
treatment. They studied this in 78 participants who got durvalumab together
with tremelimumab and 82 participants who got the standard treatment.
The researchers found that these participants lived an average of:
X 20.0 months after getting durvalumab together with tremelimumab
X 14.1 months after getting the standard treatment
