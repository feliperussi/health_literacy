Clinical Study Results
All treatments were taken by mouth. Doses were measured in milligrams, also called
mg. Participants took each of the following treatments once, but in different orders:
• 3 tablets of 200 mg AZD6094, for a total of 600 mg AZD6094
• 3 tablets of placebo that looked like AZD6094
• 1 capsule of 400 mg moxifloxacin
At the end of the study, the participants returned to the study site for a follow-up visit.
During this visit, the doctors checked their overall health and their heart health again.
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

Did AZD6094 affect the electrical activity of the heart?
Yes. On average, the participants who took the single dose of 600 mg AZD6094 had the
electrical activity of the heart slow down.
The researchers looked at the participants’ ECG test results to find out how AZD6094
affected the electrical activity of the heart. The participants had an ECG done 15 minutes
before each dose of study treatment. Then they had 12 more ECGs done every
30 minutes and then every few hours until 48 hours after each dose of study treatment.
Researchers found that 3 to 6 hours after taking AZD6094, the electrical activity of the
heart may be slowed down by more than 10 milliseconds compared to the placebo.
