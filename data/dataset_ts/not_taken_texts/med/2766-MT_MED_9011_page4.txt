Clinical Trial RESULTS
Participants were assigned by chance, like flipping a coin, to each group.
Group 1 had 20 participants. Participants went back to their study site after about 4 to
5 days to receive a different treatment and have blood and/or urine samples taken. By the
end of the study, each participant had been given 5 different treatments, the order of which
varied from participant to participant:
• One 300-milligram (mg) dose of allopurinol every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 2.5-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 7.5-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 15-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 600-mg dose of allopurinol every day (either as a 600-mg tablet once a day or
one 300-mg tablet taken twice a day)
Group 2 had 21 participants, including 1 participant who did not complete the study.
Participants went back to their study site after about 4 to 5 days to receive a different treatment
and have blood and/or urine samples taken. By the end of the study, each participant had
been given 5 different treatment assignments, the order of which varied from participant
to participant:
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 5-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 10-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 300-mg dose of allopurinol and one 20-mg dose of RDEA3170 every day
• One 600-mg dose of allopurinol every day (either as a 600-mg tablet once a day
or one 300-mg tablet taken twice a day)
All 41 participants went back to their study site about 2 weeks after their last dose of the
study drugs for a follow-up visit. Study doctors did a physical exam and an ECG, took
blood and urine samples, and answered questions about any medical problems and other
drugs the participants were taking.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked during the
study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to
decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with
RDEA3170 are not currently planned.
How did RDEA3170 and allopurinol together affect people with gout compared
to allopurinol alone?
Researchers wanted to know if taking RDEA3170 and allopurinol together would lower
uric acid in the blood more than taking allopurinol alone.
