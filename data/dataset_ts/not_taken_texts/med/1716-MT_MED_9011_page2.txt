Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 2 diabetes. Before a drug
can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if MEDI0382 can help overweight
and obese people with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels and lose
weight. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
when they were given the treatments.
In people with type 2 diabetes, the body cannot control the levels of sugar in the
blood, which can lead to several medical problems. In many cases, the cause of
type 2 diabetes is being overweight or obese, but few of the current type 2 diabetes
treatments help people to lose weight. The researchers in this study wanted to
learn if MEDI0382 can help the body control blood sugar levels and also help
people lose weight.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did MEDI0382 affect the blood sugar levels and weight of participants?
• What medical problems did the participants have when they were given
each treatment?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of
overweight or obese men and women with type 2 diabetes. The participants
in Part B were 41 to 65 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants,
doctors or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was given.
Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
MedImmune found out which treatment the participants were given so they could
create a report of the study results.
