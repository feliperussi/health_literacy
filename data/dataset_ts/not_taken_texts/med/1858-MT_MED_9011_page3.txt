Clinical Trial RESULTS
Once you joined the study, you were randomly assigned to get one of the 3 treatments
listed below.
During the study, 64 participants were randomly put into 8 groups. Within these 8
groups, participants were randomly assigned to take either AZD9567 or a placebo. The last
8 participants were put into a ninth group and were randomly assigned to take either a
steroid or a placebo. Most of the participants in the study got AZD9567, so all participants
did not have an equal chance of getting AZD9567, the steroid, or a placebo. The study’s
treatment design is listed below:
• 48 participants got AZD9567 in liquid form through the mouth. They got the
study drug in doses of 2, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 125, or 155 milligrams, or mg.
• 16 participants got the placebo in liquid form through the mouth.
• 2 participants got the placebo in pill form.
• 6 participants got 60 mg of the steroid in pill form.
Before treatment, all participants stayed at the study center for 2 days. During treatment, all
participants got their doses on the first day of the study, which was called Day 1. They stayed
at the study center for the 2 days of the treatment period, Day 1 and Day 2, and left on
Day 3. So all participants stayed at the study center for a total of 4 days. Participants came
back to the study center for 1 follow-up visit 7 to 10 days after treatment.
There were 9 groups of participants in this study, and each group had 8 participants.
In the first 8 groups, 6 out of every 8 participants got AZD9567 and 2 out of every
8 participants got the placebo. The doses of AZD9567 per group are listed below:
• Group 1 participants got 2 mg of AZD9567
• Group 2 participants got 10 mg of AZD9567
• Group 3 participants got 20 mg of AZD9567
• Group 4 participants got 40 mg of AZD9567
• Group 5 participants got 80 mg of AZD9567
• Group 6 participants got 100 mg of AZD9567
• Group 7 participants got 125 mg of AZD9567
• Group 8 participants got 155 mg of AZD9567
In the ninth group, 6 out of the 8 participants got the steroid and 2 of the 8 participants
got the placebo.
In the first 8 groups, both the participants who got AZD9567 and the participants who got
the placebo took their treatments in liquid form through the mouth. In the ninth group, both
the participants who got the steroid and the participants who got the placebo took their
treatments in the form of a pill. All participants were given their treatments without food.
