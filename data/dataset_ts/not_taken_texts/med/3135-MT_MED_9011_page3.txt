What was the purpose of this study?
There were 2 parts in this study. The main questions the researchers wanted to
answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have during Part 1 of the
study?
X How much AZD9150 got into the participantsâ€™ blood when given in different
ways in Part 2?
X What medical problems did the participants have during Part 1 and Part 2 of
the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD9150 and durvalumab help improve the health of people
with advanced solid tumors.
