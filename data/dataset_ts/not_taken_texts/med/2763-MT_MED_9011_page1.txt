RDEA3170 is a new drug being developed to treat gout. Gout is a type of arthritis.
Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that causes pain and stiffness. Joints are
where two bones meet, like the knee. Common symptoms of gout are sudden, severe
attacks of pain, redness, and tenderness in joints. This study started in May 2015 and
ended in June 2015. You and all of the 35 participants helped researchers learn how
RDEA3170 acts in the body.
