Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have after they got AZD5718?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So,
when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that
participants have during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”
They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
Part A
Out of the 36 participants who got Liquid 1 of the study drug, 15 (41.7%) had at least
1 medical problem. Out of the 12 participants who got Liquid 2 of the study drug,
2 (16.7%) had at least 1 medical problem. Out of the 12 participants who got placebo
in Group 1, one (8.3%) had at least 1 medical problem. Out of the 4 participants who got
placebo in Group 2, one (25.0%) had at least 1 medical problem.
Part B
Out of the 24 participants who got Liquid 1 of the study drug, 10 (41.7%) had at least
1 medical problem. Out of the 8 participants who got placebo, 4 (50.0%) had at least
