What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took 1 of 3 treatments:
X Olaparib on its own
X Olaparib and ceralasertib
X Olaparib and adavosertib
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took olaparib and ceralasertib as tablets by mouth. They took
adavosertib as capsules by mouth. The participants took study treatments in
21-day or 28-day periods called “cycles”. The doses of the treatments were
measured in milligrams, also known as “mg”.
