How long it took for AZD9567 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Researchers measured how long it took for AZD9567 to reach its highest amount in
participants’ blood.
Overall, researchers found the following:
• Generally, higher doses of AZD9567 led to participants having larger average
amounts and larger highest amounts of the study drug in their blood.
• Generally, it took about an hour for the study drug to reach its highest amount
in the blood.
How did AZD9567 and the steroid each affect participants’ blood sugar levels?
Researchers found the following:
• Participants who got 100, 125, and 155 mg of AZD9567 had higher average
sugar levels in their blood than participants who got the placebo.
• Participants who got the steroid also had higher average sugar levels in their
blood than participants who got the placebo.
• Participants who got 2, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of AZD9567 did not see any
effect on blood sugar levels compared to participants who got the
placebo.
