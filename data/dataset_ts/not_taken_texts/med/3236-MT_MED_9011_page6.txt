The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
At the second visit, the study doctors also checked the participants’ heart and
blood vessel health using a scan called a computed tomography angiography,
also known as a CTA.
While the participants in Part B were receiving study treatment, they
visited their study site 1 time and stayed overnight at their study site for 3 days.
Then, they visited their study site 4 more times over 8 weeks. At some of these
visits, they received their doses of study treatment.
After the participants in Part B received study treatment, they visited
their study site or had a telephone call from the study staff up to 6 times over 3 to
6 months. The exact number of visits or calls depended on the dose of MEDI6570
each participant received. At these visits and calls, the study doctors checked the
health of the participants. At 1 of these visits, the study doctors also did another
CTA scan.
What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study
results.
Because each of the different dose groups of MEDI6570 had a very small number
of participants, the results for each group have been combined into Part A and
Part B. Showing the information this way helps protect the participants’ identities.
Overall, the researchers found that the results for each dose of MEDI6570 were
similar.
