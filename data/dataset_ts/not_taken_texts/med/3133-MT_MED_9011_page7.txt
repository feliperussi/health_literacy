What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study
results.
Because there were a small number of participants in each group, the results for
both groups are combined. This helps protect the participants’ identities.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before
and after the participants got the study treatment. The study doctors did physical
exams and tested the participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall
health. They also did ECGs to check the participants’ heart health.
Overall, the researchers found that there were no significant changes in the results
of these tests and measurements.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if
they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
