Clinical Study Results
How did savolitinib act in the body when taken with famotidine?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants
throughout the study.
In these samples, they measured:
• the average total amount of the study drugs in the blood
• the average highest amount of the study drugs in the blood
The researchers compared the results from when the participants took savolitinib only to
when they took savolitinib and famotidine. This information may help future researchers
determine what other drugs can be given with savolitinib.
The researchers found that the average total amount of savolitinib in the blood was
similar when taken with and without famotidine.
The researchers also found that the average highest amount of savolitinib in the blood
was lower when taken with famotidine. But, the researchers did not consider this
difference to be meaningful.
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the
available data for the study drugs.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
