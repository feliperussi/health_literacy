What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each infant had
might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers
wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. A full
report of the study results is also available on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and
are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Did the infants who got MEDI8897 have a lower risk for getting a serious LRTI?
Yes. The researchers found that fewer infants who got MEDI8897 had LRTIs caused by RSV.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of infants who got a
LRTI associated with RSV that needed medical attention during the first 150 days after
treatment. Any LRTIs associated with RSV that did not need medical attention were not
counted in this study.
