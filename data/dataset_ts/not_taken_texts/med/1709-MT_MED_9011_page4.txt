During the follow-up period, study doctors did another physical
examination, including checking your height, weight, and heart health.
Study doctors asked again about your medical history, how you were
feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the
researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that
researchers and doctors look at the results of many studies to decide
which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical
studies with pramlintide are currently ongoing.
Did pramlintide help lower blood sugar levels more than
the placebo?
Yes. Overall, researchers found that average blood sugar levels in
participants were lower when they took pramlintide than when
participants took the placebo. Researchers measured blood sugar levels
in milligrams per deciliter of blood, or mg/dL. This is a way to measure
the amount of sugar in the blood.
