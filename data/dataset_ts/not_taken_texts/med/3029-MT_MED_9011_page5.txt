In general, the researchers found that after the last treatment dose:
• the participants who took 5 g of ZS had a 12.3% decrease in their blood
potassium levels
• the participants who took 10 g of ZS had a 21.6% decrease in their blood
potassium levels
• the participants who took the placebo had a 0.6% decrease in their blood

The figure below shows these results.

What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. Other
medical problems happened during the study, but the study doctors did not think
those other problems were related to the study drug. A lot of research is needed
to know whether or not a drug causes an adverse reaction.
