Clinical Trial RESULTS
In Part 2 of the study, participants had less uric acid in the blood 24 hours after taking both single and
multiple 12 mg doses of RDEA3170. Multiple 12 mg doses of RDEA3170 helped to reduce uric acid in the
blood more than a single 12 mg dose of RDEA3170. The figure below shows how much less uric acid was
in the blood 24 hours after taking both single and multiple 12 mg doses of RDEA3170.

In Part 3 of the study, participants had less uric acid in the blood 24 hours after taking a 6 mg dose of
RDEA3170 after fasting. They also had less uric acid in the blood 24 hours after taking a 6 mg dose of
RDEA3170 and eating a high-fat, high-calorie meal. Taking a 6 mg dose of RDEA3170 after eating a high-
fat, high-calorie meal helped to reduce uric acid in the blood more than taking a 6 mg dose of RDEA3170
after fasting. The figure below shows how much less uric acid was in the blood 24 hours after taking a 6 mg
dose of RDEA3170 after fasting and after eating a high-fat, high-calorie meal.
