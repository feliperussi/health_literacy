Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat people who have neurofibromatosis
type 1, also known as NF1. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
NF1 is a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow in nerves, which can lead to
multiple health problems. How severe these health problems are can vary from person
to person. The tumors found in patients who have NF1 are usually benign. Benign
tumors do not spread to other parts of the body.
Selumetinib may help block the growth of some tumor cells. Selumetinib is given as a
capsule. Researchers are looking for a way for young children and patients who are
unable to swallow capsules to take selumetinib.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how different forms of
selumetinib are processed by the body. The researchers compared a granule form of
selumetinib to the capsule form of selumetinib. The granule form of selumetinib is a fine
powder, like sugar, which dissolves in water.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Was there a difference in how the two forms of selumetinib were taken up by
the body?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help to find out how the granule form of selumetinib works.
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of healthy
men. The participants in this study were 23 to 44 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was taking.
This study had 2 parts, called Part 1 and Part 2. In Part 1, participants were not allowed
to eat for 10 hours before the treatment and for 4 hours after treatment. In Part 2,
participants were given a low-fat, low-calorie meal 30 minutes before the treatment. The
participants took part in both parts of the study.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order each participant got their
treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
