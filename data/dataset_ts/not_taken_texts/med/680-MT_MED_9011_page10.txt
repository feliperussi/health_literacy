Pain
The researchers found that 12 months after starting study treatment, fewer
participants had their pain get worse in the group that took olaparib than in the
group that took the NHA treatments.
To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete a
questionnaire called “Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form”, also known as BPI-SF. In
this questionnaire, the participants had to rate their pain on a scale from 1 to 10.
The study doctors also counted the number of participants who had to use strong
painkillers to help their pain. The researchers calculated the percentage of the
participants who did not have their pain get worse 12 months after starting study
treatment. They compared the results in the participants who took olaparib and in
those who took the NHA treatments.
Overall, the researchers found that the average percentage of participants who
did not have their pain get worse 12 months after starting study treatment was:
> 76.5% for the participants who took olaparib
> 43.1% for the participants who took the NHA treatments
The researchers calculated the risk of the participants’ pain getting worse after
starting study treatment. They compared the risk between the participants who
took olaparib and those who took the NHA treatments.
The participants who took olaparib had a 56% reduced risk of their pain getting
worse compared with the participants who took the NHA treatments.
