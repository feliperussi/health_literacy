Clinical Study Results
Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can be
approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took AZD7594, a placebo, or an asthma treatment
called fluticasone furoate. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did different doses of AZD7594 affect the amount of air the participants
could breathe out?
The researchers found that at some doses, the participants who took
AZD7594 breathed out more air after 12 weeks. The participants who took the
placebo also breathed out more air after 12 weeks.
• Did the participants feel that AZD7594 helped them control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took AZD7594
felt that it helped them control their asthma compared to the participants who
took the placebo.
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 2.5% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most
common medical problems were a cough and loss of voice. More details about
the results of this study are included later in this summary.
