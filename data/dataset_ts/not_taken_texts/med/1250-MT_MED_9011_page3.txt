Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, doctors or other
study staff knew what treatment each participant received. Some studies are done this
way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of
the study. When the study ended, AstraZeneca found out which treatment the participants
took so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants kept getting their usual lupus treatment, and also got either:
• 300 milligrams, also called mg, of anifrolumab
• 150 mg of anifrolumab
• a placebo
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the
drug are actually caused by the drug.
Anifrolumab and the placebo were each given through a needle into a vein. This is called
intravenous infusion, also called IV infusion. The IV infusion took at least 30 minutes.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
received. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
