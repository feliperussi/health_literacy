Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic kidney disease, also
known as CKD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Verinurad is being developed as a treatment for CKD. Doctors already use
allopurinol to treat kidney-related problems, as well as gout and having high levels
of uric acid in the blood.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of verinurad when
it was taken with allopurinol.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done that help find out if verinurad taken with allopurinol improves the health of
people with CKD.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women of Chinese or Asian
ancestry. Everyone in the study was between 27 and 48 years old when they joined.
