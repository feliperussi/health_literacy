What were the study results?
Did participants who took ticagrelor have fewer days with pain than
participants who took the placebo?
No. The researchers counted the average number of days when participants had
pain after 12 weeks of treatment and compared it to before treatment. Overall, the
researchers found that participants in all three treatment groups had fewer days with
pain on average after treatment. But the difference among the treatment groups was
too small to know if one treatment was better than the other treatments.
Participants who took 10 mg of ticagrelor reported pain on about
• 43% of the days before treatment
• 32% of the days after treatment
Participants who took 45 mg of ticagrelor reported pain on about
• 52% of the days before treatment
• 42% of the days after treatment
Participants who took the placebo reported pain on about
• 50% of the days before treatment
• 32% of the days after treatment
