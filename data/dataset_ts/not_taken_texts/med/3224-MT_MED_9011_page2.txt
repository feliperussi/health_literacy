Clinical Study Results
Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD. Before a drug can be
approved for participants to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took BGF MDI and GFF MDI.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did BGF MDI and GFF MDI affect the participants’ lung airways?
The researchers found that the participants had more airway volume in their
lungs after taking BGF MDI and after taking GFF MDI than at the start of
the study. They also had less airway resistance after taking each of the 2
treatments. When there is more airway volume and less airway resistance
in the lungs, breathing becomes easier.
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 17.4% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. These
medical problems were loss of voice, shortness of breath, itchiness, and
infection of the small airways.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
