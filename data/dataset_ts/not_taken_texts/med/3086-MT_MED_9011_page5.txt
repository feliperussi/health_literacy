Clinical Study Results
On the fifth day the participants took AB/FF:
• It took about 0.1 hours for AB to reach its highest amount in the blood.
• It took about 0.5 hours for the first AB metabolite to reach its highest amount
in the blood.
• It took about 3.0 hours for the second AB metabolite to reach its highest
amount in the blood.
• The average amounts of both AB and the first AB metabolite in the blood were
about twice as high as they were on the first day. These amounts were higher
compared to the second AB metabolite.
• It took about 19.4 hours for half of AB to leave the blood. It took a similar
amount of time for half of the 2 AB metabolites to leave the blood.
• It took about 0.1 hours for FF to reach its highest amount in the blood.
• The average amount of FF in the blood was about 1.5 times as high as it was
on the first day.
• It took about 14.1 hours for half of FF to leave the blood.
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
