Clinical Trial RESULTS
Amount of study drugs that reached the blood
Researchers measured the amount of study drugs that reached participants’
blood using hour nanomoles per litre, or h·nmol/L. This is a scientifically
accepted unit of measurement. They found that:
• participants who took only AZD7986 had an average
of 6697 h·nmol/L of the drug in their blood
• participants who took AZD7986 with verapamil had an average
of 8857 h·nmol/L of the drugs in their blood
• participants who took AZD7986 with itraconazole had an average
of 7615 h·nmol/L of the drugs in their blood
