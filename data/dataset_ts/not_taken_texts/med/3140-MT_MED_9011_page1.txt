Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug AZD5718.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of
the study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in January 2018 and ended in June 2018.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 32 participants in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease, also called
CAD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
CAD can cause the major blood vessels to become thick and narrow. This decreases
or cuts off the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart, which can cause a heart attack.
Researchers think that the drug AZD5718 may be able to help decrease the chance of
a heart attack by making these blood vessels less thick and narrow.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD5718 in healthy
participants.
