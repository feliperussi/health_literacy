Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic
cancer. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if durvalumab combined with other
treatments works in a small number of participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the
study.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells.
These extra cells can come together to form tumors. Tumors can start in any part of the
body. When a cancer is metastatic, it means that the cancer has spread to other parts
of the body to form new tumors.
There are current treatments for metastatic pancreatic tumors. But, many of these
treatments do not stop tumors from growing and can cause other medical problems.
This is because these treatments sometimes attack healthy cells instead of pancreatic
tumor cells. Researchers think that the study drug, durvalumab, may be able to attack
only the tumor cells and stop pancreatic tumors from growing.
In this study, the participants got durvalumab with other cancer treatments.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the tumors of the participants in Group 2 shrink after getting durvalumab and a drug
called AZD5069?
• Did the participants’ safety results change after they started study treatment?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and
women with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The participants in this study were 46 to
74 years old.
