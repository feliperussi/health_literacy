How did the 3 drugs taken together in different ways act in the body?
In general, the researchers found that a higher overall and average amount of the
3 drugs reached the body when the participants took the treatments that included
spacers compared to when they took the treatments without spacers.
To answer this question, the researchers measured:
• the highest amount of the 3 drugs in the blood at any time during the study
• the average amount of the 3 drugs in the lungs over 2 days
The researchers measured the highest amount of the drugs in the blood using
picograms per milliliter, also known as pg/mL. They measured the average amount of
the drugs in the lungs using picogram hours per milliliter, also known as h•pg/mL.
