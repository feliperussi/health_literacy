What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did dapagliflozin with saxagliptin and metformin affect the levels of HbA1c in
the participants’ blood?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies
can be done to find out if dapagliflozin with saxagliptin and metformin helps
improve the health of people with T2DM.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took either 1 of 2 different doses of dapagliflozin
or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in
it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in
the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug. All of the
participants also took both saxagliptin and metformin.
There were 2 main parts to this study. The researchers planned for the same
participants to be in both parts. In Part 1, all of the participants took saxagliptin
and metformin for 8 to 16 weeks, depending on what other treatments they
were already taking. Part 1 was “open-label”. This means the participants,
researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was
taking.
In Part 2, there were 3 groups of participants. Each group took 1 of 2 different
doses of dapagliflozin or the placebo. All of the participants continued taking
saxagliptin and metformin. Part 2 lasted for 24 weeks and was “double-blind”.
This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study
staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took in Part 2. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
