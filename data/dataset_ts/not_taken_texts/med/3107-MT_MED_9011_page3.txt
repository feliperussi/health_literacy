Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
At the beginning of the study, the doctors:
• did a physical examination of the participants’ hands
• asked about the medical history of participants, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
If the participants were healthy enough to join the study, the doctors applied 1 patch
to the back of each hand at the same time during this visit. Participants got 1 of the
2 treatments below:
• the study patch and the approved patch
• the study patch and the placebo patch
After treatment with the patches, the doctors gave the participants a placebo injection
on each hand where they had applied the patches. A placebo injection does not have
any medicine in it.
After this visit, the participants later visited their study site 1 more time and got the
patch treatment that they did not get at the first visit. At the second visit, the participants
got the study patch on the hand that did not get the study patch at the first visit. The
participants got another placebo injection on each hand where the doctors had applied
the patches.
There was a “washout period” of at least 4 days in between the 2 visits. During this
time, the participants were not allowed to take certain medicines. This means that
their bodies processed all of the medicines in their blood, and the study medicines had
“washed out” of their bodies.
The graphic below shows how the study was done.
