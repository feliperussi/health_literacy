Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Drugs studied: Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate
Short study title: A study to learn how budesonide, glycopyrronium, and
formoterol fumarate act in the body when combined in
an inhaler
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs
budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate.
Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results with
you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your
important role in medical research.
If you participated in this study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with this study now?
The participants were in this study for about 6 weeks. But, the entire study took about 4 months
to finish.
This study started in August 2017 and ended in December 2017. The sponsor reviewed the
data collected when this study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary
of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how it works and how safe it is. Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD. COPD is a disease that can cause
swelling in the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during the study. They also wanted to learn how budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol
fumarate act in the body when combined in an inhaler.
This information is important to know before other studies can be done that help find out if the
study treatment can improve the health of people with COPD.
