in healthy participants
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
AZD9977. AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share
the results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in February 2018 and ended in June 2018. The study included 27
participants in the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with heart failure. Before a
drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
if it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of AZD9977 in
healthy participants. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
The study drug, AZD9977, is being developed to treat patients with heart failure.
In people with heart failure, the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This
can cause damage to the heart muscle and make the heart change shape. It can
also cause fluid to build up in the arms and legs. AZD9977 may help treat these
medical problems, which may improve heart health.
