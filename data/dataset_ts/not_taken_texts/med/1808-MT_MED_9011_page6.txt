What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to AZD1775. These medical problems are called “adverse
reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is fatal, life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
There were 27.7% of participants who had serious adverse reactions during the study. This was
26 out of 94 participants.
There was 1 participant who died from a serious adverse reaction during the study. This
participant was in Group 2 and had a low level of white blood cells. This meant that the
participant could not fight off an infection.
