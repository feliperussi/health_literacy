Did the safety results change in participants who took AZD9567?
No. Overall, the researchers found that the safety results for the participants who
took AZD9567 did not change during the study.
To answer this question, the researchers did tests and took measurements
throughout the study. The researchers:
• took blood and urine samples
• did ECGs
• did physical examinations
• studied vital signs
The researchers did these tests and measurements before the participants took
the study treatment, and throughout the study. Overall, the researchers did not find
a meaningful change in these measurements throughout the study.
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”. Adverse events are
considered “serious” when they are life-threatening, cause lasting problems, or
require hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
