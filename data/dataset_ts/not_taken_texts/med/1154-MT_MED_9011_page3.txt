Clinical Trial RESULTS
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the
participants, study doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant
received. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment
each participant is getting can affect the results of the study. This way, the
results are looked at fairly.
Participants got either the 3 strain vaccine or the placebo in a single-dose
treatment. The separating of participants into different groups was done by
chance, like rolling dice.
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to 7 months.
First, to see if you could join the study, researchers did a physical exam, including
checking your height, weight, and temperature. They asked about your medical
history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking. If you are
female, you had a blood or urine test to make sure you were not pregnant.
Once you joined the study, you were randomly assigned to get either the 3 strain
vaccine or placebo. The vaccine or placebo was sprayed into your
nose. For every 5 participants, 4 received the 3 strain vaccine and 1 received
the placebo. Out of 300 participants, 240 got the 3 strain vaccine and 60 got
the placebo.
Study doctors checked how you were feeling for 180 days, or 6 months, after
getting the vaccine or placebo. They called you to learn what other medicines
you were taking and if you had any new medical problems.
