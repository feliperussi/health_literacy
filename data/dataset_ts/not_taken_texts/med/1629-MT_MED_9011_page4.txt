Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with advanced NSCLC.
NSCLC is a type of lung cancer. In people with cancer, the body is not able to
control the growth of some cells. The extra cells can form tumors. “Advanced”
usually means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or has grown
beyond the organ where it started. This is also known as “metastatic”.
The study drug, osimertinib, was designed to stop different proteins in the body
from allowing the tumors to grow. Osimertinib is already available as a treatment
for people with certain types of NSCLC.
Researchers already did studies that showed osimertinib worked for the people with
certain types of NSCLC who were in those studies. In this study, the researchers
wanted to find out more about the safety of osimertinib and how well it worked.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How long did the participants live after taking osimertinib?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
