Clinical Trial Results
Did exenatide make participants feel better or not?
Researchers gave participants a survey that asked how they felt about their disease.
Participants were asked to note whether they felt their disease had “improved”, had
“slightly improved”, was “unchanged”, was “aggravated” or felt worse, or was “unable
to evaluate” if they felt they could not give an answer. Overall, researchers found that
most participants felt their diabetes had “improved” or had “slightly improved” at the
end of their treatment with exenatide.
The table below shows the answers on the survey for the participants in each study.
16-week study 28-week study
Rating on survey (out of 43 participants) (out of 60 participants)
Improved 29 (67.4%) 55 (91.7%)
Slightly improved 7 (16.3%) 4 (6.7%)
Unchanged 5 (11.6%) 1 (1.7%)
Aggravated 1 (2.3%) 0 (0.0%)
Unable to evaluate 1 (2.3%) 0 (0.0%)
Average change in blood sugar levels over the last 2 or 3 months
Researchers measured the average change in blood sugar levels of participants
over the last 2 or 3 months. To do this, researchers measured the percentage of
blood cells that had attached themselves to the body’s blood sugar. This
measurement helps researchers estimate the blood sugar levels of participants
over the last 2 or 3 months.
Researchers found the following:
• After 12 weeks of treatment during the 16-week study, the blood sugar
level of participants had decreased by an average of 1.1%.
• After 24 weeks of treatment during the 28-week study, the blood sugar
level of participants had decreased by an average of 1.3%.
Average change in blood sugar levels without food
Researchers also measured the average change in blood sugar levels after participants
fasted, or did not eat any food. They measured the levels of sugar in the blood of
participants in milligrams per deciliter of blood, or mg/dL.
