What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab together with tremelimumab help the participants live
longer compared with standard treatment?
X What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if durvalumab together with tremelimumab helps improve
the health of people with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
What treatments did the participants
get?
The participants either got durvalumab together with tremelimumab, or they got
standard treatment. “Standard treatment” means the treatment that the medical
community thinks is appropriate for a condition. In this study, the standard
treatment was chemotherapy.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as
possible.
Each treatment was given through a needle into a vein. This is known as an
intravenous infusion, also called an IV infusion.
The participants who received standard treatment of chemotherapy got it in
periods called “cycles”. Each cycle was 3 weeks long. The participants got
chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. Some participants also got chemotherapy
on Day 8 of each cycle.
The participants got treatment until their condition got worse, they changed
their treatment, or they left the study.
