Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to help people with type 1 diabetes to control
their blood sugar. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin works in a large
number of participants with type 1 diabetes who are already taking insulin. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
Insulin is a substance made by the body. It controls the amount of sugar in the blood.
In people with type 1 diabetes, the body makes either little or no insulin. This causes
the amount of sugar in the blood to become too high. High blood sugar levels can
lead to medical problems including damaged eyesight, damaged kidneys, heart
attack, and stroke.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn what happened to the participants’
blood sugar levels when they took dapagliflozin. To find out, researchers
measured the levels of hemoglobin A1c, also called HbA1c, in the participants’
blood. The HbA1c test measures how much blood sugar is bound to a protein
called hemoglobin that is found in red blood cells.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin taken with insulin affect the HbA1c levels in the
participants’ blood?
• Did dapagliflozin taken with insulin affect the participants’ type 1 diabetes
in other ways?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women with type 1 diabetes. The participants in this study were 18 to
75 years old.
