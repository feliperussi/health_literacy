Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time.
At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the
study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and
what medicines they were taking
Throughout the study, the researchers measured the amount of AZD9977 in the
participants’ blood. They also continued checking the participants’ heart health and
overall health, and asking them how they were feeling.
During Part A, the participants visited their study site 1 time and stayed there for
10 days. There were 4 different forms of AZD9977 in this part. The participants
took each form 1 time. There was 1 tablet form, and 3 capsule forms: Capsule 1,
Capsule 2, and Capsule 3. Each dose was 300 mg.
After the participants left their study site, there was a “washout period” of up to
5 weeks before Part B started. During this time, the participants did not take any
study treatment. This was done so that each treatment could be “washed out” of
their bodies.
During the washout period, the researchers studied the results from Part A. Based
on these results, the researchers determined that the participants in Part B would
take Capsule 1.
During Part B, the participants visited their study site 1 time and stayed there for
6 days. All of the participants took the 2 below forms:
• 50 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 without food
• 300 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 with food
About 1 week after Part B ended, the participants visited their study site 1 time.
At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants’ heart health and overall
health, and asked them how they were feeling.
