Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before a drug
can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is
and how it works.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in a solid organ of the body. “Advanced” usually
means that the cancer keeps growing and is hard to treat. Normally, immune cells help stop
tumors from growing. But in people with advanced solid tumors, the tumor cells can interact
with certain proteins on the immune cells and stop the immune cells from recognizing tumor
cells.
The study drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, were each designed to stop the tumor
cells from interacting with some of these proteins. This lets the immune cells recognize
the tumor cells again and help stop the tumor from growing.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of durvalumab and
tremelimumab with chemotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors. They also
wanted to find out if taking the study drugs with chemotherapy affected the size of the
participants’ tumors.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• Did durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy slow the growth of the
participants’ tumors?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if durvalumab and tremelimumab help improve the health of people with
advanced solid tumors.
