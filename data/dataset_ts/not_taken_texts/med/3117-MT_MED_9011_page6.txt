Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study from the 2 forms of MEDI0382?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
There was 1 participant who left the study before taking a second treatment.

did not think was related to the study drug.
