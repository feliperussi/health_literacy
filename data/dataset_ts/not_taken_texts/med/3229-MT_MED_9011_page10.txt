Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the adverse events the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
These adverse events are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
Adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions listed in this section are also included in the list of adverse
events above.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
