Clinical Study Results
Hazard ratio
A hazard ratio is a mathematical formula presented as a percentage. It compares over time how
likely it is for something to happen in one group of participants compared to another group.
For the hazard ratio, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab alone were
24% less likely to die during the study compared to the participants who got SOC treatment. But,
the difference between the 2 groups was too small for the researchers to consider this difference
to be statistically significant.
How likely it was that the participants would be alive 2 years after starting the study
The researchers used a percentage to determine how likely it was that the participants would be
alive 2 years after starting the study.
The researchers found that:
• There was a 38.3% chance that the participants who got durvalumab alone would still be alive
2 years after starting the study.
• There was a 22.7% chance that the participants who got SOC treatment would still be alive 2
years after starting the study.
The figure below shows these results.
