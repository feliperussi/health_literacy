Did participants who took ticagrelor have milder pain than participants who took
the placebo?
No. Researchers measured how strong the pain was, on average, after treatment and
compared it to before treatment. Overall, they found that participants in all three
treatment groups had milder pain, on average, after treatment compared to before
treatment. But the difference among the treatment groups was too small to know if one
treatment was better than the other treatments.
Did participants who took ticagrelor use pain-relieving medicine less often than
participants who took the placebo?
No. Researchers measured how many days, on average, did participants use pain-
relieving medicine after treatment and compared it to before treatment. They found that
participants in all three treatment groups used pain-relieving medicine on fewer days, on
average, after treatment than before treatment. But the difference among the treatment
groups was too small to know if one treatment was better than the other treatments.
