What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from Group 2 of this study. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did the study treatments shrink the participants’ tumors?
None of the participants in Group 2 had tumors that shrank by at least a third of its
original size after they got adavosertib with carboplatin.
To answer this question, the study doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors
using CT or MRI scans. The study doctors measured the size of the participants’
tumors before they got study treatment and throughout the study. The doctors then
used a set of rules to calculate how much the tumors shrank. These rules are called
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also called RECIST.
If a participant’s tumor shrank by at least a third of its size, the participant was called
a “responder”. Participants whose tumors did not shrink or shrunk by less than a third
of their size were considered “non-responders”. The researchers then calculated the
percentage of responders.
In Group 2, none of the participants were responders. For this reason, the researchers
decided not to do a further study in a larger number of participants.
