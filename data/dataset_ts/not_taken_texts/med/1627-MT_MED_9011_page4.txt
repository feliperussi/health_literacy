What happened during the study?
Before starting this study, the study doctors asked about each
participant’s medical history and did a physical exam and other tests
to make sure each participant could participate.
After being accepted into the study, all 10 participants stayed in the
clinical unit for 7 days and 6 nights.
Each participant got one dose of the study drug in a tablet first and
then one dose injected in a vein. The injection was given 5 hours and
45 minutes after the tablet. All participants got the same amount of drug,
80 mg in the tablet form and 100 µg in the injection form.
Study participants had 5 more visits during the study.
Starting with the clinical unit visit, the study doctors took about 30
blood samples over 22 days to learn how much of the drug remains in
the blood at different times. They also did different tests at different
visits to make sure participants were safe. These included testing urine,
measuring blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature; and checking
the heart rhythm using an electrocardiogram (ECG).
