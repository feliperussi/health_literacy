Clinical Trial Results
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions that researchers asked during this study. It
is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines
work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with formoterol are not planned.
How did formoterol in the inhaler affect lung function compared to formoterol in the
nebulizer and to a placebo?
Researchers wanted to compare the effects of formoterol given in an inhaler to formoterol given
in a nebulizer and to a placebo. To do this, they measured how many liters of air participants could
exhale at different times during the study.
Researchers studied:
• The change in how much air participants could exhale within 12 hours after treatment
on Day 7 of a treatment visit
• The change in how much air participants could exhale within 6 hours after treatment
on Day 1 and Day 7 of a treatment visit
• The change in how much air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 7
of a treatment visit
Overall, researchers found that:
• Participants had a similar increase in the amount of exhaled air when they took 12 µg of
formoterol in the inhaler compared to 20 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer.
• Participants had a higher increase in the amount of exhaled air when they took 24 µg of
formoterol in the inhaler compared to 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler.
• Participants had a slightly higher increase in the amount of exhaled air when they took
12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler compared to 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler.
• Participants had a higher increase in the amount of exhaled air when they took 24 µg of
formoterol in the inhaler compared to 40 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer.
Change in how much air participants could exhale 12 hours after treatment on Day 7
of a treatment visit
Researchers measured how much air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1 of
each treatment visit, several times within 12 hours of getting treatment, and again 12 hours after
treatment on Day 7. Researchers then compared those 2 amounts.
Compared with the amounts of air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1:
• Participants who took 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.11 more liters of air
• Participants who took 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.12 more liters of air
• Participants who took 24 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.16 more liters of air
• Participants who took 20 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer exhaled 0.12 more liters of air
• Participants who took the placebo did not show any change in the amount of exhaled air
