What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did AZD5718 affect the levels of leukotriene E4 in the participants’ urine?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies
can be done to find out if AZD5718 helps improve the health of people with
coronary artery disease.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took 1 of 2 different doses of AZD5718 or a
placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the
participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what the participants were taking, but the participants did
not.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as
possible.
AZD5718 and the placebo were taken as tablets by mouth once a day. Overall:
> 52 participants were planned to take a high dose of AZD5718
> 25 participants were planned to take a low dose of AZD5718
> 52 participants were planned to take the placebo
