Clinical Study Results
Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat rheumatoid arthritis, also called RA.
Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took AZD9567 and a placebo that looked like prednisolone,
or they took prednisolone and a placebo that looked like AZD9567. Prednisolone is a
steroid treatment that has already been approved to treat RA. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did AZD9567 help the participants manage their RA symptoms?
To answer this question, the researchers studied the severity of the participants’
RA before and after they took study treatment. They found that in both treatment
groups, there was a decrease in the severity of the participants’ RA. The researchers
considered this decrease to be similar for both groups.
• What medical problems happened during the study?
There were 42.9% of participants in the overall study who had medical problems
that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. The most
common medical problems were dry mouth, feeling hot, pain in the upper stomach
area, and increased appetite.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
