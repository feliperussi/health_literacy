Clinical Trial Results
How did AZD5634 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to see how the drug acted in the body. They wanted to know:
• The total amount of AZD5634 in the blood over time
• The highest amount of AZD5634 in the blood
• How long it took for AZD5634 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Due to very low amounts of AZD5634 in the blood, researchers were not able to measure the results
for the participants who got the 10 and 27 µg doses of AZD5634.
Total amount of AZD5634 in the blood over time
Researchers measured the total amount of AZD5634 in the blood over time of participants in
nanomoles each hour per liter of blood, or h•nmol/L. This is a widely accepted scientific unit
of measurement.
The figures below show this amount for Part A and Part B of the study.

Treatment group Treatment group
For Part A and Part B, participants who got the higher doses generally had higher total amounts of
AZD5634 in the blood over time.
Highest amount of AZD5634 in the blood
Researchers measured the highest amount of AZD5634 in the blood of participants in nanomoles per
liter of blood, or nmol/L. This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.
