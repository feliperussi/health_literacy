Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in December 2019 and ended in March 2020. The researchers planned
for the study to have 2 parts. The researchers determined that famotidine did not affect
how savolitinib acted in the body during the first part, so they decided not to do the
second part.
Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 1 time over the
course of about 1 month. During this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the
participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an
ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
While the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 2 times over the
course of about 1 month. Both visits lasted 4 days. During each visit, the participants took
their treatment in an order that was randomly chosen.
There was a “washout period” of about 2 weeks in between the 2 visits. During this time,
the participants did not take any study treatment and did not take certain medicines.
This means that their bodies had time to process all of the study treatments, and any
medicines in their blood had “washed out” of their bodies.
