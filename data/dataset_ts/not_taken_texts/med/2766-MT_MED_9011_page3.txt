Clinical Trial RESULTS
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means that the participants and the study staff knew
what study drugs each participant took.
What happened during the study?
This study had 41 participants with gout between the ages of 28 and 74.
Participants had some visits to their study site during a period of 35 days. Before starting this
study, study doctors did a physical exam, took blood and urine samples, and asked about
each participant’s medical history to make sure they could participate in the study. Study
doctors also did an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check the heart’s rhythm. Both before and
during the study, study doctors checked participants’ blood pressure, heart rate, and body
temperature. Study doctors also took blood and urine samples to measure the amounts of
RDEA3170, allopurinol, oxypurinol, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid in participants’
blood and/or urine. They asked participants how they were feeling, including whether they
had any gout symptoms and what medications they had taken since their last visit.
