What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have?
X Did AZD4076 affect the liver fat or the blood sugar of the participants?
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD4076 helps improve the health of people with T2DM and
NAFLD.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either AZD4076 or a placebo as an injection
through a needle under the skin of the belly. A placebo looks like a drug but does
not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of
the effects they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused by the
drug.
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what the participants were getting but the participants did
not.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants who got AZD4076 in this study got more frequent doses during
the first 10 days of treatment compared to doses after. This is called a “loading
dose”. The doses of AZD4076 were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
The participants in Group 2 got a higher loading dose than the participants in
Group 1.
