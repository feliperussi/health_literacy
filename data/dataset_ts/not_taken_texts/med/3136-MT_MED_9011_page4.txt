In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if olaparib helped stop the
participants’ cancer from coming back or getting worse after it had been treated
with chemotherapy. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took olaparib, how long did they live with their cancer
before it got worse?
X Did the participants have any change in their quality of life when they took
olaparib?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done, to find out if olaparib helps improve the health of women with ovarian
cancer.
What treatment did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took olaparib.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The participants took olaparib as a tablet by mouth. The initial dose of olaparib
was 300 milligrams, also known as mg. The participants took olaparib twice a day,
which was a total of 600 mg of olaparib a day. It was possible to reduce the dose
of olaparib for participants if they had any medical problems during the study. The
study participants took olaparib until their cancer got worse or came back, the
study doctors thought they should stop study treatment, or they left the study for
another reason.
