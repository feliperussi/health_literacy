All of the study treatments were taken as tablets by mouth, once a day. The
doses of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin were measured in milligrams, also known
as mg. All of the participants continued taking the same dose of metformin that
they were already taking before the study.
There were 8 participants who did not continue into Part 2, so Part 2 only
included 41 participants.

What happened during the study?
The participants were in the study for up to 9.5 months. But, the entire study
took 18 months to finish.
The study started in February 2019 and ended in August 2020. The study ended
early because the sponsor decided to stop researching the combination of
dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin together. This was not related to the
safety of the combination of study treatments.
