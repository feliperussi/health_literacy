Clinical Study Results
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have
been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for the drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
