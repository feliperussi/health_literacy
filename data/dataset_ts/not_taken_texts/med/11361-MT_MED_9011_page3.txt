What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how tezepelumab passes through, breaks
down, and leaves the body in healthy Chinese participants when it is given as an
injection at 3 different doses.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How did each of the 3 different doses of tezepelumab pass through, break
down and leave the participants’ bodies
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done
to find out if tezepelumab helps improve the health of people who have conditions
caused by inflammation.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got either tezepelumab or a placebo through
a needle under the skin, also called an injection. A placebo looks like a drug but
does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused
by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could
create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
