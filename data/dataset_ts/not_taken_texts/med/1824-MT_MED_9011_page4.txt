During the study, study doctors did tests to make sure the
participants were still healthy.
There was a 14-day “washout period” between the second and third
visits. During the washout periods, participants were not allowed to
take certain medications. This means that when participants took
the next study treatments, all medications had been processed and
“washed out” of their bodies. There was another washout period in
between the third and fourth visit.
At the end of the study, participants returned to the study site
for a follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last treatment. During this
visit, study doctors took more blood and urine samples and asked
participants how they were feeling. Researchers also did an ECG to
check participants’ heart health and did a full physical examination.
