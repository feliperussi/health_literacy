How did dapagliflozin taken with insulin affect the HbA1c levels in the
participants’ blood?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took dapagliflozin with
insulin had lower HbA1c levels compared with the participants who took the
placebo with insulin. The participants who took 10 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin
had lower HbA1c levels compared with the participants who took 5 mg
of dapagliflozin with insulin.
The researchers compared the HbA1c levels from the start of the study to the
HbA1c levels after 24 and 52 weeks of treatment.
The researchers learned that on average, after 24 weeks of treatment:
• the participants who took 5 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin had a 0.37%
decrease in their HbA1c levels compared with participants who took the
placebo with insulin
• the participants who took 10 mg of dapagliflozin with insulin had a 0.42%
decrease in their HbA1c levels compared with participants who took the
placebo with insulin
