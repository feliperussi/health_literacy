Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
Study Title: A study to learn if sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can help
lower potassium levels in the body
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study
treatment sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, also known as ZS.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare
this summary of the study results for you.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in October 2017 and ended in November 2017.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
The study included 22 participants in China.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have high levels
of potassium in the body. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Potassium is a substance found in food. The body uses potassium in several
ways, including helping the heart to work normally. If the bodyâ€™s potassium levels
are too high, the heart may not work normally. This can lead to several medical
problems.
