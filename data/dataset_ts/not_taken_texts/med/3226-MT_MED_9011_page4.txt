What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did tezepelumab reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the participants’
airways?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if tezepelumab helps improve the health of people with severe
asthma.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either tezepelumab or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo
to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the study
drug are actually caused by the study drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was
getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the
participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended,
the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could
create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants got tezepelumab or the placebo through a needle under the skin,
also known as an injection. The dose of tezepelumab was measured in milligrams,
also known as mg.
