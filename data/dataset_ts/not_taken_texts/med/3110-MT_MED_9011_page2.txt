Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat triple negative breast cancer that
has spread. They also want to understand more about how certain genetic changes,
also called “mutations”, affect potential cancer treatments. Before a treatment can
be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
At the start of this study, the participants took 1 of 3 treatments:
X Olaparib on its own
X Olaparib and ceralasertib
X Olaparib and adavosertib
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X When the participants took study treatment, how long was it before their
cancer got worse?
How long the participants lived with their cancer before it got worse was
different between treatment groups. It was also different between participants
with and without certain genetic mutations.
X What medical problems happened during this study?
More than 80.0% of participants who took study treatment had medical
problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study
treatments. The most common medical problems were nausea, and having a
low level of red blood cells, which is also called anemia.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
