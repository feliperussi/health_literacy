researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how MEDI0382 works in the
liver in people with T2DM who were also overweight and were likely to have
NAFLD/NASH.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one
study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with MEDI0382 are planned.
