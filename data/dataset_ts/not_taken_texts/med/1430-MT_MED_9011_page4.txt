What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for Group 1 of this study
were:
X Did the study treatments shrink the participants’ tumors?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before larger studies can
be done to find out if durvalumab with tremelimumab help improve the health of
people with ES-SCLC.
What treatments did the participants get?
All of the participants in Group 1 of this study got durvalumab with tremelimumab.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
The participants got durvalumab and tremelimumab through a needle in a vein,
also known as an IV infusion. The doses of the study drugs were measured in
milligrams, also known as mg.
The participants got study treatment until they left the study, or until the study
doctors thought the study treatments were not helping them.
The chart below shows the treatments that the participants in Group 1 got.
