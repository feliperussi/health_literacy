Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with moderate to severe
COPD. The participants in this study were 46 to 76 years old when they joined.
All of the participants in the study had smoked for at least 10 “pack-years”. This is
about the same as smoking an average of at least 1 pack of cigarettes a day for
10 years.
The study included 23 participants in Belgium and the Netherlands.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD. Before a treatment can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works
and how safe it is.
COPD is a lung disease that blocks the airways and makes it hard for air to flow
in and out of the lungs. It also causes shortness of breath. COPD gets worse over
time. Most people who develop COPD are current or former smokers.
BGF MDI and GFF MDI are inhalers that work by expanding the airways and
reducing inflammation in the lungs. This can help people with COPD breathe better.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if BGF MDI and GFF MDI work in
participants with COPD. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did BGF MDI and GFF MDI affect the participants’ lung airways?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if BGF MDI and GFF MDI help people with COPD.
