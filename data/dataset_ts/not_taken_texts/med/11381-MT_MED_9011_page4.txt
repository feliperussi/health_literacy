What treatments did the participants
take?
In this study, all of the participants took a radio-labelled form of AZD4831.
“Radio-labelled” means that it had a low amount of radioactivity in it. The
radioactivity made it easier for the researchers to look at AZD4831 in the
participants’ bodies.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The dose of AZD4831 was measured in milligrams, also known as “mg”.
The participants did not eat for at least 8 hours before taking AZD4831, and did
not eat again until about 4 hours after taking AZD4831.
The chart below shows the treatment the participants took.
