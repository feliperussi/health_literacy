Clinical Study Results
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how MEDI6012 works in a small number
of participants with cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis. They also wanted
to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
Atherosclerosis is a condition in which deposits of cholesterol, fat, and other substances
build up in the arteries and other blood vessels. These deposits, also called plaques,
narrow the blood vessels and make it more difficult for blood to flow. This can lead to
serious medical problems like a heart attack. People with cardiovascular disease caused
by atherosclerosis have had medical problems with their heart or blood vessels because
of these deposits.

Treatments for people with atherosclerosis include drugs that prevent blood clots from
forming or reduce the total amount of cholesterol that gets made in the liver.
Cholesterol can be found in all of the body’s cells. It plays an important part in making
sure the body works properly. But there are good and bad types of cholesterol in
the body. Bad cholesterol, also known as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL
cholesterol, forms the plaques that clog arteries and other blood vessels. Good
cholesterol, also known as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL cholesterol,
actually helps remove bad cholesterol from the blood. Researchers think MEDI6012
might increase levels of good cholesterol and other substances that help reduce the
build-up of bad cholesterol in blood vessels. This might reduce someone’s chance of
having a heart attack.
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did MEDI6012 affect the amount of good cholesterol in the blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
