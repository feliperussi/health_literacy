How did midazolam act in the body when taken with savolitinib?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants after
both parts of treatment.
In these samples, they measured:
• the average total amount of the study drugs in the blood
• the average highest amount of the study drugs in the blood
The researchers compared the results from when the participants took midazolam only to
when they took midazolam and savolitinib. This information may help future researchers
determine what other drugs can be given with savolitinib.
The researchers found that the average total and highest amounts of midazolam in the
blood were similar when taken with and without savolitinib.
