What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening,
causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have
been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Did any adverse reactions happen during this study?
None of the participants had adverse reactions during this study.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how dapagliflozin works in people with T2DM.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with the study drug are planned.
