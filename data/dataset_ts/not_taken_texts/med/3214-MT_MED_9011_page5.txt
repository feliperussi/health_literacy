Clinical Study Results
To answer this question, the study doctors measured how much air the participants could breathe
out in 1 second. The researchers compared the results of this measurement before and after
each 2-week treatment period. The amount of air was measured in liters, also called L.
Overall, the researchers found that compared to before treatment:
• After taking AZD8871, the participants could breathe out an average of 0.19 L more air in
1 second.
• After taking the placebo, the participants could breathe out an average of 0.02 L less air in
1 second.
• After taking Anoro Ellipta, the participants could breathe out an average of 0.23 L more air
in 1 second.

Did AZD8871 help the participants manage their COPD symptoms?
Overall, the researchers found that AZD8871 helped the participants better manage their COPD
symptoms compared to the placebo. The researchers found that the participants’ ability to
manage their COPD symptoms was similar when they took AZD8871 compared to when they
took Anoro Ellipta.
To answer this question, the study doctors kept track of the participants’ coughing throughout
the study and gave them surveys throughout the study that asked them to record and rate any
COPD symptoms they had. These surveys were called:
• Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale, also called BCSS
• COPD Assessment Test, also called CAT
