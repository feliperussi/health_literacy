Clinical Study Results
During the study, the participants visited their study site 1 time and stayed there for
12 days. During this time, they took either AZD9977 or a placebo. The first group of
participants who took AZD9977 started out taking a low dose. Then, the researchers
carefully studied the results for those participants before deciding to increase the dose in
the next group of participants.
There were 4 treatment groups in the study. Each group took 14 doses of 1 of the below
treatments:
• 7 participants took 50 mg of AZD9977
• 6 participants took 150 mg of AZD9977
• 6 participants took 300 mg of AZD9977
• 9 participants took a placebo
Throughout the study, the researchers continued checking the participants’ heart health
and overall health, and asking them how they were feeling.
About 1 week after taking their last treatment, the participants visited their study
site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants’ heart health and
overall health, and asked them how they were feeling.
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study results.
Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and
measurements that were done before the participants took treatment to the results
throughout the study.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants’ results
during the study. But these changes were too small for the researchers to consider them
to be significant.
