Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of women with ovarian cancer. The participants
in this study were 40 to 85 years old when they joined.
It was planned that all of the participants had already received a type of
chemotherapy known as platinum-based chemotherapy that had removed their
ovarian cancer completely or partly. It was planned that the participants taking
part in this study did not have any harmful changes in certain common cancer
genes that had been inherited. The researchers tested for 2 cancer genes called
BRCA1 and BRCA2.
The study included 279 participants in Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to stop ovarian cancer from coming back or
getting worse after it has been treated with chemotherapy. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how well it
works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if olaparib works in a large number
of participants with ovarian cancer. In people with cancer, the body is not able to
control the growth of cells. These cells can form tumors. In people with ovarian
cancer, tumors typically form in the ovaries, or they may rarely form in:
X the lining of the inside of the abdomen
X the lining of the uterus
X the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus
The study drug, olaparib, was designed to help stop tumor cells from repairing
themselves when they are damaged. This makes it harder for tumor cells to grow
and survive.
