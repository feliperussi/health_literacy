Clinical Trial RESULTS
Highest average amount of study drugs in participants’ blood
Researchers compared the highest average amount of lesinurad and allopurinol in the blood
of participants in Groups 1 and 3. Researchers calculated this using micrograms per milliliter,
or μg/mL.
The figure below shows the results for Doses A, B, E, and F.

Lesinurad Allopurinol
How much lesinurad and allopurinol stayed in participants’ blood with food compared
to without food?
To answer this question, researchers studied participants in Group 2. Participants in Group 2
took one combined 200/300-mg tablet of lesinurad/allopurinol without food for Dose C and
the same tablet with food for Dose D.
Overall, researchers found that the average amounts of both study drugs that stayed in the
blood were similar whether participants took the tablet with or without food. However,
the highest amount of lesinurad in the blood was higher when participants took the tablet
without food than with food. The highest amount of allopurinol in their blood was similar
whether participants took the tablet with or without food.
