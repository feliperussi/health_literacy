Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how safe it is and how it works.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. “Advanced”
usually means that the cancer keeps growing even with treatment. The cancer
may also be “metastatic”. This means that it has spread to other parts of the body
or has grown beyond the organ where it started. In people with advanced solid
tumors, certain proteins cause the tumor to grow. The study drug, MEDI1873,
was designed to stop 1 of these proteins from letting the tumor grow and to cause
tumor cells to die.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI1873 in
participants with advanced solid tumors.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if MEDI1873 improves the health of people with advanced
solid tumors.
