CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155
Were any differences seen in the participant’s vision during the study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to see if inebilizumab infusions could prevent deterioration in
vision. All participants were asked at the beginning and at the end of the study to take a vision test. The
test involved looking at a chart and letting the tester know the smallest characters that could be seen.
The participant’s visual loss was similar between the inebilizumab treatment
and the placebo treatment.
Were any changes seen on MRI scans during the study?
All participants had an MRI scan of their central nervous system (an internal image of the optic nerve,
spinal cord and brain) at the beginning of the study and again at the end of the study. The researchers
wanted to see if either of the study treatments reduced the number of new abnormal growths (also
called lesions) seen on the MRI scans over time.
Among participants who had new lesions, those treated with inebilizumab
infusions had more than 1 new lesion on their MRI scan (on average 1.6 new
lesions). In comparision, participants treated with placebo infusions had more
than 2 new lesions on their MRI scan (on average 2.3 new lesions).
Treatment with inebilizumab infusions therefore reduced the number of new MRI
lesions compared to treatment with placebo infusions.
Did the treatments reduce the risk of NMOSD hospitalizations?
INEBILIZUMAB PLACEBO
10 out of 174 participants (6%) treated 8 out of 56 participants (14%) treated
with inebilizumab infusions were with placebo infusions were
hospitalized during the study. hospitalized during the study.
These participants experienced Hospitalizations ranged between
1 hospitalization each. 1 and 3 each.
Inebilizumab infusions therefore reduced the number of NMOSD-related
hospitalizations compared with placebo infusions.
