What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> How did AZD7594 act in the blood?
> What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if AZD7594 improves the health of people who have asthma.
The answers to these questions are important to learn more about how AZD7594
works.
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants took the same dose of AZD7594 through an inhaler. The
doses were measured in micrograms, also called μg.
If the participants’ asthma got worse at any time during the study, they could take
a “rescue medicine”. This was a medicine chosen by the study doctors that the
participants could take to help manage their asthma. The rescue medicines in this
study were salbutamol or albuterol.
There were 2 groups of participants in this study. The first group included
participants who were 12 to 14 years old. The second group included participants
who were 15 to 17 years old.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants and their caregivers
knew what treatment the participants were taking. The researchers, study doctors,
and other study staff also knew what treatment each participant was taking.
