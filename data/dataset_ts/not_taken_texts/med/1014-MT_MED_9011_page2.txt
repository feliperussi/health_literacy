Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 1 diabetes. Before a drug
can be approved for patients to take with other drugs, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out how dapagliflozin affects the body
when it is taken with insulin in a large number of participants with type 1 diabetes.
They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during
the study.
Dapagliflozin is already approved to treat type 2 diabetes. But, dapagliflozin has
not yet been approved to treat type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is a disease that causes the body to not make enough insulin.
Insulin helps control the amount of glucose, also known as sugar, in the blood. If
the body doesn’t make enough insulin, the amount of sugar in the blood can be
too high.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin combined with insulin affect the body?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women with type 1 diabetes who had been taking insulin for at least 12 months
before joining the study. The participants in this study were 21 to 73 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participants
knew what the participants were taking.
In this study, all of the participants took dapagliflozin and insulin. The amount of
insulin each participant took was decided by the study doctors, but the dose of
dapagliflozin was chosen randomly.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the dose of dapagliflozin each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
