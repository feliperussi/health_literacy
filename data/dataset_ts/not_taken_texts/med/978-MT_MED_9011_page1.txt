Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs dapagliflozin
and saxagliptin. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about using these study
drugs to help people who have type 2 diabetes and kidney damage.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study with
the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped
prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel
proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 8 months. But the entire study took about
2 years and 8 months to finish. The study started in September 2015 and ended in May 2018.
The study included 448 participants in Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea,
South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, and the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
