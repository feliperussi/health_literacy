Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with high potassium levels in
their blood. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
The researchers did earlier ZS studies in other groups of participants. When this study
started, the researchers had gathered only a small amount of information on how ZS works
in Japanese participants. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if Japanese
participants with high blood potassium had any medical problems while taking ZS.
People with high levels of potassium in their blood often don’t have any symptoms that can
be seen, but they may have problems with their heartbeat. This can be dangerous and in
rare cases, it can lead to death.
ZS was designed to work by attaching to potassium in the gut and stopping it from getting
into the blood.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
• Did the participants feel their health was better after taking ZS?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study that may have
been caused by ZS?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and
women with high blood potassium. The participants in this study were 25 to 95 years old.
People who had taken ZS within 30 days of the start of the study could not take part.
