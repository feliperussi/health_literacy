Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug studied: AZD8871
Short study title: A study to learn if AZD8871 is safe to take
for Japanese patients with COPD
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug AZD8871. This drug is being
developed to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as
COPD. The study started in June 2017 and ended in November 2017.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with you and the public. An independent nonprofit organization called
CISCRP prepared this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you understand
and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat a lung disease called COPD. COPD
causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can make it harder to breathe.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to
find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study. This information is important to know before other studies
can be done that help find out if AZD8871 improves the health of people with COPD.
