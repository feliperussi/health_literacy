Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with triple negative breast
cancer that has spread. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how olaparib, ceralasertib, and
adavosertib work in participants with triple negative breast cancer. They also
wanted to know if certain genetic changes affected how the study treatments
worked. Genetic changes are also called “mutations”.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. These
cells can form tumors. When the cancer spreads to other parts of the body or
surrounding tissue, it is called “metastatic” cancer.
Triple negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer where the cells are unable
to use hormones called “estrogen” and “progesterone” in the normal way, and
they also don’t have a protein called “HER2”. Triple negative breast cancer is hard
to treat because many of the treatments available for other types of breast cancer
don’t work for this type of cancer.
The study drugs olaparib, ceralasertib, and adavosertib are designed to make it
harder for tumor cells to repair their DNA when damaged. This makes it harder for
the tumor cells to grow and survive.
The researchers wanted to find out if olaparib on its own, or olaparib combined
with ceralasertib or adavosertib, helped stop the participants’ cancer from getting
worse. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during the study.
