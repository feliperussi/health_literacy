What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems participants had during the study that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. The website listed at the
end of this summary may have more information about the adverse reactions that happened in
this study. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
No participants had serious adverse reactions in Part A or Part B during the study.
