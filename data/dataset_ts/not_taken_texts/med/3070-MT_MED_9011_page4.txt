Clinical Study Results
There were some participants who left the study early and did not finish treatment. So, they either
took only the tablet made in the United States, or only the tablet made in Puerto Rico. The number
of participants who completed each part and took both tablets was:
• 51 participants in Part 1
• 51 participants in Part 2
• 49 participants in Part 3
• 41 participants in Part 4
Because 96 participants left the study early, the results below include information for the
remaining 192 participants.
Did similar amounts of drugs from the dapagliflozin/metformin tablets made in
the mainland United States get into participants’ blood as the tablets made in
Puerto Rico?
Yes. The researchers found that overall, the same amount of drugs from the dapagliflozin/
metformin tablets made in the mainland United States got into the participants’ blood as the
tablets made in Puerto Rico.
To answer this question, the doctors measured the levels of dapagliflozin and of metformin in
the participants’ blood. They measured the highest amount of each drug in the blood of each
participant. They also measured the total amount of each drug in the blood of each participant.
The researchers then calculated the average highest and average total amounts of dapagliflozin
and metformin in the blood for each group.
Once the researchers found the averages in each part of the study, they compared:
• the average highest amount of dapagliflozin in the blood after taking tablets made in the
mainland United States with those made in Puerto Rico
• the average highest amount of metformin in the blood after taking tablets made in the
mainland United States with those made in Puerto Rico
• the average total amount of dapagliflozin in the blood after taking tablets made in the mainland
United States with those made in Puerto Rico
• the average total amount of metformin in the blood after taking tablets made in the mainland
United States with those made in Puerto Rico
