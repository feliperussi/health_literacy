What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did the amount of acalabrutinib that got into the participants’ blood differ
when it was taken as a tablet compared with a capsule?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if using acalabrutinib as a tablet helps improve the health of
people with B-cell lymphoid cancer.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants took:
X acalabrutinib as a tablet by mouth
X acalabrutinib as a capsule by mouth
The participants were split into 2 groups. Each group of participants took the
2 study treatments in a different order.
A computer program was used to randomly choose what group each participant
joined. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers studied.
