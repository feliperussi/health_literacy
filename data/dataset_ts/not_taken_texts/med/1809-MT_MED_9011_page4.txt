Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant
knew what the participant was taking.
In this study, treatment happened in 21-day periods called “cycles”. The
participants took part in the study until their cancer got worse, they decided to stop
taking part in the study, the study doctors stopped their participation, or the study
finished. So, the participants each had a different number of treatment cycles.
There were 2 parts to this study:
• Part A included participants with solid tumors. There were different groups
of participants who took adavosertib and olaparib at different doses and on
different schedules.
• Part B included participants with SCLC, who had not previously taken part
in Part A of the study. All of the participants in Part B took the same dose of
adavosertib and olaparib on the same schedule throughout Part B.
The participants took adavosertib and olaparib tablets by mouth at home. The
doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.
At the beginning of the study, only a few participants joined each of the treatment
groups. The study doctors looked at the results for these participants. Then, the
researchers decided whether or not to include more participants in each treatment
group.
Each participant stayed on the same dose of adavosertib and olaparib throughout
the study.
There were 2 participants, 1 in Part A and 1 in Part B, who joined the study but
never took any study treatment. So, this summary includes information about 119
participants in Part A, and 9 participants in Part B.
