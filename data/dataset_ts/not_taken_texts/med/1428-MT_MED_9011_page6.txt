What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants got either:
X Durvalumab with tremelimumab
X Durvalumab alone
X Standard treatment for HNSCC
Each treatment was given through a needle into a vein. This is called an
intravenous infusion, also known as an IV infusion.
The doses of durvalumab and tremelimumab were measured in milligrams, also
known as mg.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, study doctors, and
other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are assigned fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants got.
