Clinical Study Results
How much ticagrelor got into the participants’ blood when they took it as a
tablet meant for children?
The researchers found that the amounts of ticagrelor and the metabolite in the blood
were about the same for each of the treatments they compared.
To answer this question, the researchers compared taking ticagrelor as several children’s
tablets to several children’s tablets mixed with water.
This information helps the researchers learn if ticagrelor and the metabolite were found in
similar amounts in the blood when the tablet meant for children was not mixed with water.
The chart below shows the results the researchers found:

What medical problems did participants have?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during this study. None of the
participants died during this study.
