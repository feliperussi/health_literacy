Clinical Trial RESULTS
What happened during the study?
You and the other participants were in the study for almost three months. There
were three treatments during the study, and all participants who completed
the study took all three. In between the three treatments, there were “washout
periods,” during which you and the other participants did not receive the study
drugs. Washout periods help get rid of the effect from the study drugs taken
during the previous treatments.
This study had three treatments. All participants had all three treatments in
the same order:
• The first treatment lasted one day. During this treatment, you and the
other participants were given 25 milligrams, or mg, of AZD7986 in liquid
form through the mouth.
• The second treatment lasted 10 days. On Day 1 through Day 10 of this
treatment, you and the other participants were given a 240 mg tablet of
verapamil once daily before food. On Day 5, you were also given 25 mg
of AZD7986 in liquid form through the mouth one hour before getting
food.
• The third treatment lasted 11 days. On Day 1 of this treatment, you
and the other participants were given 200 mg of itraconazole in
liquid form through the mouth twice daily, 12 hours apart. On
Day 2 through Day 11 of this treatment, you were again given 200 mg of
itraconazole in liquid form through the mouth but only once daily. On
Day 6 of this treatment, you were also given 25 mg of AZD7986 in liquid
form through the mouth. Throughout the study, doctors checked your
blood pressure, body temperature, and took blood samples. They also
checked your heart using an electrocardiogramme, or ECG.
