Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with T2DM who were also
overweight or obese.
In people with T2DM, the body cannot balance and use “glucose” normally.
Glucose is a sugar that is used as energy for the body. People with T2DM
typically have too much blood glucose and are overweight or obese.
Having T2DM and being overweight or obese can cause a condition called
NAFLD/NASH. NAFLD, also called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is a
condition in which extra fat builds up in the liver. NASH, also called non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, is a form of NAFLD in which there is also inflammation
and damage in the liver. These 2 diseases together are called NAFLD/NASH.
The participants in this study were 51 to 77 years old when they joined.
The study included 21 participants in Sweden.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with T2DM who are
likely to have NAFLD/NASH. Before a drug can be approved for people to get,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In people with NAFLD/NASH, there is more fat in the liver than normal. This
may cause inflammation and damage in the liver. Inflammation and damage in
the liver can lead to liver disease and liver failure. Also, in people with NAFLD/
NASH, the body has more energy than normal. The body stores this extra
energy as fat in the liver and other parts of the body.
There are currently no treatments for NAFLD/NASH. But, researchers think that
treatments that decrease liver fat, inflammation, and liver damage might help
prevent liver failure. Researchers also think that treatments that decrease blood
glucose levels and body weight will also help people with NAFLD/NASH.
