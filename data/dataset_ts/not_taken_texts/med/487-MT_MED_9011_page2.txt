STUDY IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION
TREATMENT STUDIED: MEDI-551 (inebilizumab)
FULL TITLE: A double-masked, placebo-controlled study with open-label period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
MEDI-551 in adult subjects with neuromyelitis optica and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.
STUDY NUMBERS: United States, NCT02200770 | Europe, 2014-000253-36 | Protocol, CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: This was a Phase 2/3 study. Phase 2/3 studies can take several years to complete and look
at how safe and effective a potential new treatment is. An independent committee was used in this study to assess its
safety and the overall conduct. Based on their recommendations, the study was stopped early because the benefit of
inebilizumab infusions compared with placebo had been demonstrated and it was no longer ethical to treat participants
with placebo infusions.
