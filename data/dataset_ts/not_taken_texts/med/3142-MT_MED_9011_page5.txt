Clinical Study Results
Part C
The 24 participants in Part C visited their study site 1 time and stayed there for about
2 weeks. During this time, they took a small-particle treatment of AZD8154 or the
placebo 11 times.
About 1 week after taking the last treatment, all of the participants visited
their study site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants’
overall health and lung health, and asked them how they were feeling.
What were the results of the study?
This is an overall summary of the main results from this study. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the study
results.
Did the participants have changes in their safety results during the
study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of specific tests
and measurements that were done before the participants took treatment and
throughout the study.
The researchers focused on the below tests and measurements:
• physical examinations
• blood and urine tests
• ECGs
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the results of
these tests and measurements during the study. But these changes were too small
for the researchers to consider them significant.
