What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in Part B and Part C of the study got MEDI7219 either as
tablets by mouth or as an IV infusion.
Part B and Part C were “open-label” parts of the study. This means the
participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each
participant was getting.
In Part B, there were 2 treatment groups. In each treatment group, the
participants took 2 different formulations of MEDI7219. In between taking
each formulation, the participants waited at least 1 week. Overall, there were 4
separate formulations of MEDI7219 and each participant took 2 of them.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers studied in Part B.
