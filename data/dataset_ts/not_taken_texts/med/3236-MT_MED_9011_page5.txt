Part A
Before the participants in Part A received study treatment, they visited
their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks. At this visit,

medical problems they were having

as an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants in Part A were receiving study treatment, they
visited their study site 1 time. Most of the participants stayed overnight at their
study site for 3 nights, but some could go home for the nights. During this visit,
they received their dose of study treatment.
After the participants in Part A received study treatment, they visited
their study site or had a telephone call from the study staff up to 11 times over
3 to 6 months. The exact number of visits or calls depended on the dose of
MEDI6570 each participant received. At these visits and calls, the study doctors
checked the health of the participants.
