Clinical Study Results
Before treatment, the participants in each treatment group had UACRs that were higher than
normal. After 24 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that overall:
• The participants who took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin together had a 41.0% decrease in their
UACR.
• The participants who took dapagliflozin and the placebo had a 27.0% decrease in their UACR.
• The participants who took the placebo treatment had an 8.0% decrease in their UACR.
The figure below shows these results.

Did the participants’ blood sugar levels change after taking the study drugs
together?
Yes. The researchers found that the participants who took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin together
had a change in their blood sugar levels.
To answer this question, the researchers compared the blood sugar levels in the participants who
took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin with the levels in the participants who took the placebo treatment.
To do this, the doctors did hemoglobin A1c tests before the main part of the study and throughout
the study. The hemoglobin A1c test is also called the HbA1c test. It measures how much blood
sugar is attached to a protein called hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells. Since red blood
cells live for about 3 months, the HbA1c test measures the average levels of sugar in the blood
over the past 3 months.
The researchers found that after 24 weeks of treatment, both treatment groups had a decrease in
their blood sugar levels. The participants who took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin together had a larger
decrease in their blood sugar levels compared to the participants who took the placebo treatment.
