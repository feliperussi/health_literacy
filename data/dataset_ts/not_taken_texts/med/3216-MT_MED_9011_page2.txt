Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with advanced solid
tumors. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. “Advanced”
usually means that the cancer cannot be controlled with treatment. The cancer
may also be “metastatic”, which means that it has spread to other parts of the
body or has grown beyond the organ where it started. In people with advanced
solid tumors, certain proteins allow the tumor to grow. The study drug, olaparib,
was designed to stop 1 of these proteins from letting the tumor grow and to cause
tumor cells to die.
Researchers often use mathematical calculations, also called models, to find out
how drugs act in the blood and to help design future studies. In this study, the
researchers wanted to develop a mathematical model to predict the amount of
olaparib in the blood of participants with advanced solid tumors.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Could the researchers develop a useful model to predict the amount of
olaparib in the participants’ blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to help understand how different
doses of a drug act in the body. Other studies can be done that help find out if
olaparib improves the health of people with advanced solid tumors.
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced solid
tumors. The participants had either tried treatments that did not help their cancer,
or there were no treatments available for their cancer. Everyone in the study was
29 to 84 years old when they joined.
