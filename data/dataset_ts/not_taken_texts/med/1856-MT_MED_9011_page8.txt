Clinical Study Results
Deaths
Overall, 39.6% of participants died during the study due to their cancer getting worse. This was
21 out of 53 participants.
In Part 1, 25.7% of participants died. This was 9 out of 35 participants. These deaths were due to
the participants’ cancer getting worse and not thought to be related to MEDI9197.
In Part 2, none of the participants died.
In Part 3, 70.6% of participants died. This was 12 out of 17 participants.
• There was 1 death that the study doctors thought was related to MEDI9197. This was the participant
in Group 9 who had a DLT.
• There were 11 deaths that were due to the participants’ cancer getting worse.
What medical problems did participants have during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that
the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These medical problems are called
“adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, cause
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
The study doctors, in agreement with the study researchers, stopped the study early because
MEDI9197 did not help the participants and was causing a lot of adverse reactions. The
researchers only included in their final report the results that would be most important for people
to understand more about the study drug. So, the results below do not include information from
the 5 groups who did not have participants included in the study.
