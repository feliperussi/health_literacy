Clinical trial results
In between the 6 treatment visits, there were “washout periods” of
10 to 14 days. During the washout periods, participants were not
allowed to take certain drugs. This helped get rid of any effects from
previous treatments.
During the study, researchers did tests to check the health of the
participants.
At the end of the study, researchers called all of the participants 12 to
16 days after their last visit. During this follow-up phone call, researchers
asked participants how they were feeling.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers
asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the
results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest
for participants. Further clinical studies with abediterol are currently planned.
How did abediterol affect the body?
Researchers wanted to know how the study drug affected the body.
So they measured how much air participants could exhale after getting
the treatments. The figure below shows these amounts after participants
got all 6 treatments:
