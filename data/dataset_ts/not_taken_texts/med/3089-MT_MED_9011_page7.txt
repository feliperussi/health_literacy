Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other trials may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
For the 2 main questions below, the researchers only looked at participants who
were born with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. There were only 3 participants
whose BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations happened later in life, so their results are not
included. So, the results below are for 252 of 255 participants.
How long did the participants live without their cancer becoming worse
after they started taking olaparib?
The researchers found that the participants lived for a median of 8.2 months
without their cancer becoming worse after taking olaparib.
To find this out, the researchers counted the number of months each participant
lived without their cancer becoming worse, and then calculated the median
number of months for all participants. The “median” is the middle number in a
group of numbers when ordered from lowest to highest.
How long did the participants live after they started taking olaparib?
The researchers found that the participants lived for a median of 24.9 months
after taking olaparib.
To determine this, the researchers counted the number of months each
participant lived after taking olaparib, and then calculated the median number
of months for all participants.
