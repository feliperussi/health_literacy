Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI0382 help lower the participants’ blood sugar levels?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got MEDI0382 had a greater
decrease in their blood sugar levels compared to the participants who got the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ blood sugar levels before
they got treatment and throughout the study. Then, they compared the measurements before
treatment to the measurements after 1 month of treatment. The blood sugar levels were
measured in milligram hours per deciliter, also called mg*h/dL.
Overall, the researchers found that after 1 month of study treatment:
• The participants who got MEDI0382, metformin, and dapagliflozin had an average decrease in their
blood sugar levels of 151.3 mg*h/dL. This was an average decrease of 22.0%.
• The participants who got the placebo, metformin, and dapagliflozin had an average decrease in their
blood sugar levels of 14.6 mg*h/dL. This was an average decrease of 0.4%.
The figure below shows these results.
