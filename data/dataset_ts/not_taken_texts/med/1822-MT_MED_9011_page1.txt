Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug
MEDI7734.
MedImmune, LLC sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the
results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this

What is happening with the study now?
This study started in August 2016 and ended in November 2017. It included 36
participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a
report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat immune system diseases. Before
a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
Immune system diseases happen when certain types of immune system cells
attack healthy cells in the body. This can lead to health problems. The study drug,
MEDI7734, is being developed to treat these diseases. MEDI7734 may help
reduce these types of immune system cells in the body.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
â€¢ What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
