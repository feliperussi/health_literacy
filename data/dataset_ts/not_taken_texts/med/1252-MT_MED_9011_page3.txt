Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with active proliferative
lupus nephritis.
The participants in this study were 18 to 67 years old when they joined.
The study included 147 participants in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, France,
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, Spain,
Taiwan, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat active proliferative lupus
nephritis. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if anifrolumab works in participants
with active proliferative lupus nephritis. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Normally, the body’s immune defense system only attacks infections or cancer
cells. But in people with lupus, the body’s immune defense system wrongly attacks
the body’s own healthy tissues. This can cause inflammation in the joints, skin,
kidneys, and other organs. When there is inflammation of the kidneys in someone
with lupus, it is known as “lupus nephritis”. Doctors can tell the type of lupus
nephritis a person has by taking a small piece of the kidney with a small surgical
procedure called a biopsy. Doctors can then look at this small piece of the kidney,
under a microscope to see if it has a certain pattern called “active proliferative
lupus nephritis” and needs a certain type of treatment.
Researchers think that specific proteins in the body called “type 1 interferons” are
involved in the inflammation that causes lupus and lupus nephritis. Interferons are
also called IFN and are made by the immune system. In people with lupus and
other diseases of the immune system, also called autoimmune diseases, the body
can make too much IFN.
