Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat ovarian cancer in women whose cancer has
come back after chemotherapy treatment. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD1775 works in participants with ovarian
cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer. All the participants had already had
chemotherapy, but their cancer had come back. They also wanted to find out if the participants had
any medical problems during the study.
A protein called WEE1 helps cancer cells to grow. AZD1775 slows the growth of cancer cells
by stopping WEE1 from working. Researchers think that giving patients AZD1775 together with
chemotherapy can help keep the cancer from coming back.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How many participants had their tumors shrink or disappear?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of women over the age
of 18 years with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer. The participants in
this study:
• were women 34 to 85 years old
• had advanced cancer and at least 1 tumor
• had their cancer come back after finishing prior chemotherapy
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew what the
participant was getting.
There were 6 treatment groups in this study. Each participant was in only 1 of the groups. In
each group, the participants got both AZD1775 and a specific type of chemotherapy. AZD1775
was taken as a pill by mouth. Doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg. Each type of
chemotherapy was given through a needle into the vein, also called an IV infusion.
Chemotherapy treatment happens in cycles. At the end of a cycle, the patient either starts a new
cycle or finishes treatment. The number of cycles depends on the type of chemotherapy the
participant has.
