Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drugs
osimertinib and durvalumab. All of the participants helped researchers learn more
about osimertinib and durvalumab to help people with lung cancer.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it
helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in August 2015. It included 29 participants in Canada, the Republic
of Korea, and Taiwan. These participants are still finishing their study visits, but the
study researchers stopped asking for new participants to join. This study ended early
due to potential side effects found in a separate but related study.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected as of August 2017 and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
