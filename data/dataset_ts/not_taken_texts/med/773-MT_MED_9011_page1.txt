Thank you
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study that studied the drugs selumetinib
and durvalumab, and thank you to the families of the participants. AstraZeneca sponsored this
study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent non-profit organization called
CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If you or a family member participated in the study and have questions about the results, please
speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in December 2015 and ended in July 2018.
There were 2 parts in the study, Part 1 and Part 2. The participants in Part 1 had advanced solid
tumors of different types of cancer and were in the study for up to about 2 years. The participants
in Part 2 had advanced cancer of the colon and were in the study for up to about 1 year. The
entire study took about 2 and a half years to finish.
The researchers planned for this study to have 3 parts, but they found that the participantsâ€™ cancer
was not responding to the study drugs as expected. The researchers ended the study after Part 2
and did not start Part 3.
Part 1 of the study included 28 participants in the United States. Part 2 included 30 participants in
the United States.
AstraZeneca reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
