Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs in the China cohort.
This section is a summary of all the adverse events in the China cohort, whether
they might be related to the study drugs or not. An adverse event is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant
needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the drugs in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
Although there were 3 groups in the China Cohort, the adverse events the
participants had are presented together, as there were a small number of
participants in each group.
