Clinical Study Results
What happened during this study?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in September 2019.
Before the participants in any part got treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could
join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• checked the participants’ lung health
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what
medicines they were taking
Throughout all 3 parts, the study doctors continued doing these tests and
measurements.
In Part 1, the participants stayed at their study site for about 1 week and got
1 dose of MEDI3506 or the placebo.
After this, the participants visited their study site 11 times over the course of about
6 months so the study doctors could check their health.
In Part 2, the participants visited their study site 6 times over the course of about
4 weeks. At 3 of those visits, they got MEDI3506 or the placebo. At the other 3 visits,
the study doctors only checked the health of the participants.
After this, the participants visited their study site 8 times over the course of about
5 months so the study doctors could check their health.
In Part 3, the participants stayed at their study site for about 1 week and got
1 dose of MEDI3506 or the placebo.
After this, the participants visited their study site 9 times over the course of about
6 months so the study doctors could check their health.
