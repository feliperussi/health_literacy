Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think
might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study
drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that happened in this study are not in this summary. Because
there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps
protect their identities. The website listed at the end of this summary may have other
information about medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results presented here are for a single study. These results helped the researchers
learn how different combinations of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin act in the
body when taken with and without food, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always
talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Further clinical studies with dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin are planned.
