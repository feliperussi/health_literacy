Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI0382, also called cotadutide.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about MEDI0382 to help
people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or
fatty liver. Having type 2 diabetes mellitus, also called T2DM, can cause these
conditions.
AstraZeneca UK sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the
results of the study with the participants and the public.
An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this
summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel
proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak
