A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatments each
participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
Durvalumab was given as an injection into a vein, also known as an IV infusion.
Olaparib and the placebo were taken as tablets by mouth. The doses of the study
drugs were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
The participants continued getting study treatment until their cancer got worse or
until they left the study.
