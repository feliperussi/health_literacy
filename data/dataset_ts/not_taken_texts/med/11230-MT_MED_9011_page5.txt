How much cotadutide got into the participants’ blood when injected
into different parts of the body?
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of cotadutide
in the participants’ blood before and after they got each injection. The
researchers then compared the average total amount of cotadutide that got
into the participants’ blood when it was injected into the belly and when it was
injected into the arm or the thigh.
Overall, the researchers found that the average total amount of cotadutide in
the participants’ blood was:
> similar when it was injected into the arm compared to the belly
> smaller when it was injected into the thigh compared to the belly
