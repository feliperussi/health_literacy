Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of young people with T2DM. The participants in this study
were 11 to 24 years old when they joined.
The study included 72 participants in Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, and
the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat T2DM in young people. Before a drug can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe
it is.
In people with T2DM, the body does not make enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls
the level of blood sugar, which is also called glucose. T2DM causes blood glucose levels to rise
higher than normal. This can cause medical problems.
Researchers can measure blood glucose levels by looking at a protein in red blood cells called
hemoglobin. When red blood cells are carrying glucose, the hemoglobin changes shape and is
called HbA1c. Lower levels of HbA1c mean improved control of blood glucose levels.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin affected the HbA1c levels in a
large number of participants with T2DM. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did dapagliflozin affect HbA1c levels in the participants’ blood after 24 weeks of treatment?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if dapagliflozin helps improve the health of young people with T2DM.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took dapagliflozin and a placebo as tablets by mouth. A
placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to
help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually
caused by the drug. The dose of dapagliflozin was 10 milligrams, also known as mg. All of the
participants continued taking their regular T2DM treatments throughout the study.
