Clinical Study Results
Lung function at 24 weeks:
Researchers measured the participants’ lung function at the end of treatment.
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function before taking
a treatment dose compared with participants who took formoterol fumarate by
itself using MDI. They were able to exhale an average of 39 mL more air than
participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
• The participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol
fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function over the
4 hours after taking a treatment dose compared with participants who took
budesonide by itself using MDI. They were able to exhale an average of
173 mL more air than participants who took budesonide by itself using MDI.
The figure below shows these results.

before taking a treatment dose over the 4 hours after taking a treatment dose
The participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate
together using MDI had more increased lung function over the 4 hours after taking
a treatment dose compared with participants who took budesonide by itself using
MDI. They were able to exhale an average of 157 mL more air than participants
who took budesonide by itself.
