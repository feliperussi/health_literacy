Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI0382 affect how many calories the participants burned off?
No. To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants throughout
Part 2 to exercise on a stationary bicycle, and then rest. The study doctors used a
machine called a calorimeter to measure the participants’:
• total number of calories burned
• calories burned off during exercise
• calories burned off during rest
Overall, the researchers found that there were differences in these measurements
between the MEDI0382 group and the placebo group during Part 2. But, these
differences were too small for the researchers to consider them to be meaningful.
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together
with all of the available data for the treatments.
Some of the participants left the study during Part 1 before they received any of the
study drug MEDI0382. So, the information below is for only 25 participants.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
