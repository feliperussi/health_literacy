Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who recently had a sudden
heart attack caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the heart.
This type of heart attack is called an ST elevation myocardial infarction, also called
a “STEMI”. The participants in this study were 34 to 80 years old when they
joined.
All of the participants:
X were planned to receive a treatment called primary percutaneous coronary
intervention, also called “pPCI,” which helps open blocked arteries.
X had heart attack symptoms for less than 6 hours.
People whose heart could not pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs,
had received CPR, or had been given medicine to break down blood clots before
or after they arrived at the hospital could not join this study. People who had a
previous heart attack or a type of surgery called a coronary artery bypass graft that
helps blood get past clogged arteries also could not take part in this study.
The study included 593 participants in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel,
the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
