What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the study results.
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements
throughout the study.
The study doctors did physical exams and tested the participants’ blood and
urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check the
participants’ heart health. Overall, the researchers found that some study
participants had an increase in a liver protein called ALT. The researchers decided
to stop the study to prevent any future increases in ALT in the study participants.
After the study treatment was stopped, all of the participants were monitored until
their increased ALT levels had gone back to normal and there was no AZD4076 in
the participants’ blood.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if
they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
