Clinical Study Results
Creatinine is a waste product made by muscles when they move. When the kidneys are
healthy, they remove creatinine from the bloodstream into urine.
When the kidneys are not working properly, they do not remove creatinine from the blood
as efficiently, and albumin leaks into urine. This means that the amount of albumin in
urine goes up and the amount of creatinine goes down.
Low UACR means that there is less albumin than creatinine in urine, which means
there is little or no kidney damage. High UACR means that the amount of albumin
has increased relative to creatinine, which means there is more kidney damage. The
researchers measured UACR before, during, and after participants took RDEA3170 and
febuxostat or the placebos.
The researchers used the “least square mean” calculation to compare the difference in
UACR after taking each treatment. This is a calculation that researchers use to account
for any measurements taken before starting treatment. In this study, researchers used
the least square mean to account for any differences between each participant’s UACR
measurements before they started the treatment. This helps make sure that study results
are as accurate as possible.
After 12 weeks of treatment, the UACR decrease compared to the start of the treatment
was calculated.
• UACR was 48.7% lower in the participants who took RDEA3170 and febuxostat
• UACR was 15.3% lower in the participants who took the placebos
The figure below shows these results.
