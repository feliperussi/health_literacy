What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital
care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for AZD5718.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
