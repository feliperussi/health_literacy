Clinical Study Results
This study had 2 parts.
In Part A, the participants visited their study site 6 times during treatment. At the first
treatment visit, all of the participants took one 80 mg dose of osimertinib. At each visit,
the doctors took blood to measure the amount of the drug in the participants’ blood. They
also checked the participants’ overall health.
The participants with damaged kidneys continued into Part B, where the doctors
continued to check the participants’ tumors, kidneys, and overall health. The participants
with healthy kidneys did not continue into Part B, but could continue taking osimertinib
according to their doctor’s recommendation.
There were 7 participants in Part A with damaged kidneys, but 1 of these participants left
the study before Part B. So, the researchers could only study the overall results for 6 of
the 7 participants for Part B.
The chart below shows how Part A of the study was done.
