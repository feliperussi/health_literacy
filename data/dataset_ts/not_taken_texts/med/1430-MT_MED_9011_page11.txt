Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study
drugs adavosertib and carboplatin.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about adavosertib with
carboplatin to help people with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, also called
ES-SCLC.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the
results of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
