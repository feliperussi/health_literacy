Researchers think that getting benralizumab regularly can help get rid of the extra
eosinophils and other immune cells. This could help control asthma symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab affected the
allergic response in the participants’ lungs and if it affected their breathing.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did benralizumab affect the participants’ allergic responses in their lungs?
> Did benralizumab affect the amount of air the participants could breathe out
after an allergic trigger?
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to understand how benralizumab
helps improve the health of people with asthma.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants got either benralizumab or a placebo. A placebo
looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a
placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
get the drug are actually caused by the drug.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants,
researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each
participant was getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing
what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study.
When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the
participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
