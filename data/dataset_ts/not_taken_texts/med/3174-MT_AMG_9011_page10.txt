Heart rate
The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. An increase in
heart rate is one sign that heart function has become worse. After 20 weeks of
treatment, researchers found that:
 Heart rate slightly increased in participants taking the placebo and
decreased in participants taking omecamtiv mecarbil.
These are just some of the main results of the study. More results may be available at
the websites listed at the end of this summary.

What is important to know about these results?
 Part 1 of this study was designed to find out which of the 3 formulations of
omecamtiv mecarbil should be tested in Part 2. Researchers found the amount of
omecamtiv mecarbil released into the blood over 12 hours was best controlled by
Formulation 1 and chose this formulation to test in Part 2.
 During Part 2, researchers found the expected levels of omecamtiv mecarbil in
participants’ blood after 12 weeks of treatment with Formulation 1.
Some participants in this study had side effects that the study doctor thought could be
associated with study treatments. In Part 1, no serious side effects occurred in more than
1 participant in the omecamtiv mecarbil group. Calculated as a percentage, 1 participant
is the same as 1.4%, or about 14 out of 1,000 people. In Part 2, some serious side
effects occurred in 2 participants in both the omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo groups.
Calculated as a percentage, this is the same as 1%, or 1 out of 100 people.
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at 544 people with heart failure.
The results for any individual could have been better or worse than the results for their
group. Also, no single clinical study can give a complete picture of the benefits and risks
of an investigational medicine. Other studies may find different results. It takes many
studies to know whether a medicine might one day be a treatment option for certain
patients.
