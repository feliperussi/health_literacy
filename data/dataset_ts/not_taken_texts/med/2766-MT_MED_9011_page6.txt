Clinical Trial RESULTS
Researchers also wanted to know how the study drugs affected the amounts of xanthine
and hypoxanthine that left the body in participants’ urine. Allopurinol works by keeping
the body from breaking down xanthine and hypoxanthine, so the chemicals leave the body
before they form uric acid. This keeps uric acid levels in the blood lower, which can reduce
the risk of developing gout and help gout patients get better.
In both groups, researchers found that:
• The amount of hypoxanthine and xanthine that left the body in urine increased after
participants took allopurinol alone. Researchers found increases of xanthine in the
urine ranging from 360% to 2385%, and they found increases of hypoxanthine in
the urine ranging from 108% to 754%.
• When participants took any amount of RDEA3170 with 300 mg of allopurinol, the
increase in xanthine and hypoxanthine was similar to when participants took 300 mg
of allopurinol alone.
How did RDEA3170, allopurinol, and oxypurinol act in the body?
Researchers took blood and urine samples throughout the study to measure the amount
of RDEA3170, allopurinol, and oxypurinol in the body. They found that:
• Participants who took the highest doses of RDEA3170 had the highest measured
amounts of RDEA3170 in their blood.
• When participants took RDEA3170 with 300 mg of allopurinol, less than 1%
of RDEA3170 left the body through the urine without being broken down.
• The amount of allopurinol in the blood generally stayed the same no matter which
dose of RDEA3170 participants took.
• The amount of oxypurinol in the blood decreased when participants took
RDEA3170 with allopurinol. This amount decreased more as participants took
higher doses of RDEA3170, up to 15 mg.
• The amount of oxypurinol that left the body in the urine increased by 5% to 29%
when participants took RDEA3170 with allopurinol compared to allopurinol alone.
• The rate at which oxypurinol was filtered out of the body by the kidneys increased by
32% to 101% when participants also took RDEA3170 with allopurinol compared to
allopurinol alone.
