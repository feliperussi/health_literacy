Clinical Study Results
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of 3 different
AZD9977 doses.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if AZD9977 improves the health of patients with heart failure.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in the study
were 23 to 45 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the
participants were taking, but the participants did not.
There were 3 treatment groups in this study. In each group, the participants took
either AZD9977 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to make sure any of the effects they see
in the participants who take a drug are actually caused by that drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
This was also a “dose-escalation” study. This means that each group got only
1 dose amount of AZD9977 during the study. Researchers use dose-escalation
treatments so they can study the effects and safety of a drug dose before increasing
the dose for other participants.
In this study, different groups of participants were given different doses of AZD9977.
The researchers carefully studied the results from each group before deciding
whether or not to give the next higher dose to the next group of participants.
