Clinical Study Results
Did durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy slow the growth of
the participants’ tumors?
To answer this question, the study doctors took pictures of the participants’ tumors using
CT or MRI scans. They measured the size of the participants’ tumors before they got
study treatment and throughout the study. To do this, they used a set of rules called
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also called RECIST.
The researchers only looked at these results for the participants in Group 5 with pancreas
cancer because they could compare it to a previous study in pancreas cancer.
The researchers found that tumor growth slowed in some of the 6 participants in Group
5 after they got durvalumab and tremelimumab with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
But, the number of participants in Group 5 was too small for the researchers to know if
durvalumab and tremelimumab with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine slowed the growth
of the participants’ tumors compared to the previous study.
What medical problems happened during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study
that the study doctors thought might be related to any of the study treatments. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the
available data for the study treatments.
