Did ticagrelor lower the number of pain crises that the participants had
during the study?
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were no important differences
between the group of participants who took ticagrelor and the group who took
the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of pain crises each
participant had per year during the study and calculated the average.
Overall, the researchers found that the average number of pain crises per year
was:
> 2.74 pain crises for the participants who took ticagrelor
> 2.60 pain crises for the participants who took placebo
This difference was so small that the researchers did not consider it to be
important.
Did the participants feel that ticagrelor helped their symptoms and
quality of life?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took ticagrelor and those
who took the placebo did not feel that the study treatment helped their symptoms
and quality of life.
