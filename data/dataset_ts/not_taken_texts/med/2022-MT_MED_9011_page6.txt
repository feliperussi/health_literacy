Clinical Study Results
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is
considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires
hospital care.
Usually the results from several studies are needed to decide if a treatment causes an
adverse reaction. At the time of this study, it was not known if these adverse reactions
