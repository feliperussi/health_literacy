Clinical Trial Results
Did pramlintide help participants in other ways?
Yes. Compared to when participants got the placebo and insulin, the
researchers found:
• A decrease in the average amount of their blood sugar after
all meals when participants got pramlintide and insulin.
• A decrease in the average amount of their blood glucagon, a hormone
that raises blood sugar levels after meals, when participants got
pramlintide and insulin.
• An increase in the average amount of time that participants had
normal blood sugar levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL when
participants got pramlintide and insulin.
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical
problem. Researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants
have during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”.
They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
During this study, more participants had medical problems when they got
pramlintide and insulin compared to when they got the placebo and insulin.
The table below shows the number of participants who had medical
problems in the study. Three participants (9.4%) stopped taking the study
drug because of medical problems. Two of the participants had nausea and
vomiting, and 1 participant had high blood sugar. Researchers thought that
the nausea and vomiting were caused by the pramlintide treatment, but
the high blood sugar was not.
