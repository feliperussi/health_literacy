Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
MEDI0382. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about MEDI0382
to help people who have type 2 diabetes and are overweight or have obesity.
MedImmune sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit
organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We
hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their important role in
medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak

Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 2 diabetes. Before a drug
can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
it works and how safe it is.
What treatments were the participants given?
There were 2 parts to this study, Part 1 and Part 2. In Part 1, all of the participants
were given a placebo for about 2 weeks. A placebo looks like a drug but does not
have any medicine in it. In Part 2, the participants were given either MEDI0382 or a
placebo for about 6 weeks.
