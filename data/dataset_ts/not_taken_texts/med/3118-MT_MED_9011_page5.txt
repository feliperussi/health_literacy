Clinical Study Results
What effect did MEDI0382 have on participants’ heart rates while they used
a treadmill?
Overall, the researchers found that MEDI0382 did not affect participants’ heart rates while
they used a treadmill.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the change in participants’ heart rates
on both Day 1 and Day 26 of the study. Heart rate is measured in beats per minute, also
called bpm. Depending on age, a healthy heart rate while not exercising is about 60 bpm
to 100 bpm. Depending on age, a healthy heart rate while exercising is about 90 bpm to
170 bpm.
On Days 1 and 26, the researchers measured the participants’ heart rates before and
after they ran on a treadmill for 9 minutes. Then, they compared the results. On Day 1,
the participants got only esmolol. On Day 26, the participants got esmolol and MEDI0382
together.
Overall, the researchers found that:
• When the participants got only esmolol on Day 1, their average change in heart rate after
running was 61.7 bpm. Their average heart rate before running was 67.6 bpm, and their
average heart rate after running was 129.3 bpm.
• When the participants got esmolol and MEDI0382 together on Day 26, their average
change in heart rate after running was 60.3 bpm. Their average heart rate before running
was 84.0 bpm, and their average heart rate after running was 144.3 bpm.
The figure below shows these results.
