Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat sickle cell disease in children and
teenagers. In this summary, sickle cell disease will be referred to as SCD. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
if it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either ticagrelor or a placebo. A placebo looks
like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did ticagrelor lower the number of pain crises that the participants
had during the study?
“Pain crises” are a common symptom of SCD that happen when blood vessels
become blocked. Overall, the researchers found that there were no important
differences between the group of participants who took ticagrelor and the
group who took the placebo.
> Did the participants feel that ticagrelor helped their symptoms and
quality of life?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took ticagrelor and
those who took the placebo did not feel that the study treatment helped their
symptoms and quality of life.
> What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 4.2% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This was
8 out of 192 participants. The most common medical problems were headache
and dizziness. More details about the results of this study are included later in
this summary.
