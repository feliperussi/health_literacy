What signs and symptoms did the participants have during this study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and
after the participants received study treatment. The doctors did physical exams
and tested the participants’ blood and urine samples to check their overall health.
They also did ECGs to check the participants’ heart health. Overall, the study
doctors did not think there were any results in these tests and measurements that
were important.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatments or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
