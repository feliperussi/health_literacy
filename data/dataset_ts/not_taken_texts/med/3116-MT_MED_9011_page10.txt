To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to answer
some questionnaires about their quality of life and their asthma symptoms. The
participants answered these questionnaires at the beginning of the study and after
they got study treatment. These questionnaires were:
> Standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older,
also called AQLQ(S)+12
> Asthma Control Questionnaire-6, also called ACQ-6
> Asthma Symptom Diary, also called the ASD
AQLQ(S)+12
The participants gave responses to each question on the AQLQ(S)+12 on a scale
from 1 to 7, which then gave a score. The researchers then calculated average
AQLQ(S)+12 scores. A high average score meant that the participant’s asthma
was not affecting their quality of life. A low average score meant that asthma was
severely affecting their quality of life.
The researchers compared the change in scores before and after 1 year of
treatment. They compared the results for the participants who got tezepelumab
to those for the participants who got the placebo. An increase in average
AQLQ(S)+12 score meant that the participants felt that study treatment helped
their quality of life.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average AQLQ(S)+12 score was:
> an increase of 1.48 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> an increase of 1.14 for the participants who got the placebo
ACQ-6
The participants received scores from 0 to 6 on each question based on their
responses to the ACQ-6. From the responses to the ACQ-6, the researchers
calculated average ACQ-6 scores. A high average ACQ-6 score meant that the
participant’s asthma was not well controlled, and a low average ACQ-6 score
meant that the participant’s asthma was well controlled.
