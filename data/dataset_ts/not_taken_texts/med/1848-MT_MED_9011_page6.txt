Clinical Trial RESULTS
Highest amount of study drugs in the blood over time
Researchers measured this using nanomoles per litre, or nmol/L. This is a
scientifically accepted unit of measurement. They found that:
• participants who took only AZD7986 had an average highest amount
of 385.8 nmol/L of the drug in their blood
• participants who took AZD7986 with verapamil had an average highest
amount of 591.9 nmol/L of the drugs in their blood
• participants who took AZD7986 with itraconazole had an average highest
amount of 234.1 nmol/L of the drugs in their blood
Generally, a higher amount of AZD7986 reached participants’ blood when they
took the study drug with either verapamil or itraconazole versus when they
took the study drug by itself.
What medical problems did participants have?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem.
So when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical
problems that participants have during the study. These medical problems are
also called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems in this study?
A total of 11 participants (73.3%) in the study had medical problems.
Researchers looked at the medical problems participants had after they
took each drug in the three treatments. The table below shows how many
participants in each treatment group developed medical problems. No
participants stopped taking the study drugs because of medical problems.
