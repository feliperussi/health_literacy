How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about using selumetinib and durvalumab together
in patients who have advanced solid tumors. The researchers plan to compare the information
collected in this study to the results of other studies that used the study drugs separately.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide
new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with combined selumetinib and durvalumab treatments are not planned.
