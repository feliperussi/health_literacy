Clinical Study Results
There were 2 participants who left the study after taking GFF MDI. One of these
participants had taken BGF MDI before taking GFF MDI. There were also 2
participants who did not have a scan after taking BGF MDI. So, the results on
airway volume and resistance below are for 20 participants who took BGF MDI and
21 participants who took GFF MDI.
Airway volume
When there is more airway volume in the lungs, breathing becomes easier.
Compared to the start of the study, the researchers found that:
• When the participants took BGF MDI, the airway volume in their lungs
increased by an average of 72%.
• When the participants took GFF MDI, the airway volume in their lungs
increased by an average of 53%.
