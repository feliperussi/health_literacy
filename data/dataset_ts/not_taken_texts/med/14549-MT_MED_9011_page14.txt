In COV002, some of the participants were also given a weekly swab test for
COVID-19 throughout the trial, even if they did not have symptoms. This let the
researchers check for “asymptomatic” COVID-19, meaning someone who has
COVID-19 but has no symptoms.
In all 4 of the trials, independent reviewers looked at the results. These are professionals
who do not work for the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca, or any other sponsor, and were
not involved in performing the trials. This helps make sure that the results are looked at
fairly. Independent reviewers do this for both the results about effectiveness and the results
about safety.
What are the results of these trials?
The effectiveness of a vaccine or treatment at preventing infection during a clinical
trial is known as “efficacy”. Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide
which vaccines are most effective and are safest. Other trials may provide new
information or different results.
How effective was AZD1222 more than 14 days after the second
injection?
To measure the efficacy of AZD1222, the researchers compared:
• the number of participants who had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19
in the AZD1222 groups more than 14 days after their second injection
• the number of participants who had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19
in the control groups more than 14 days after their second injection
Then, the researchers used a mathematical model to calculate the efficacy as a
percentage.
