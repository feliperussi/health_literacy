Clinical Trial RESULTS
How does the body break down osimertinib when it is swallowed
in tablet form compared to when it is injected?
Researchers took blood samples from participants after they took
osimertinib in tablet form and then injection form.
They found the following:
• Tablet form: The highest amount of osimertinib in the blood
(118.00 nM) was reached at 7 hours after taking the tablet.
Half of the osimertinib left the blood within 60 hours.
• Injection form: The highest amount of osimertinib in the blood
(0.58 nM) was reached at 15 minutes after taking the injection.
Half of the osimertinib left the blood within 55 hours.
