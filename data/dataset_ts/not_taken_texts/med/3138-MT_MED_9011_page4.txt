Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ safety results?
Overall, the researchers found that MEDI0382 did not affect the participants’ safety
results differently than other drugs of this type compared to the placebo.
To answer this question, the doctors did tests and took measurements at different
times after the participants got an injection of study treatment. The doctors:
• asked the participants about their health and any medications they were taking
• took blood and urine samples
• did physical examinations
• tested the participants’ breathing
• studied vital signs
• did electrocardiograms, also called ECGs, to check the participants’ heart health
The researchers found that:
• The Japanese participants who got 100 μg or 150 μg of MEDI0382 had a slight
increase in their heart rate 48 hours after getting MEDI0382
• The Chinese participants who got 100 μg of MEDI0382 had a slight increase in their
heart rate 48 hours after getting MEDI0382
But, the differences between these groups and the groups that got a placebo were
too small for the researchers to know if MEDI0382 caused the increased heart rate.
The researchers also found that participants who received the 150 µg dose were
more likely to have nausea or vomiting than the participants who got the placebo.
The researchers did not find any other differences in the safety results of the
participants who got MEDI0382 and the participants who got a placebo.
