Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. This study
happened in 6 parts: Part A to Part F. This summary shows only the results
for Part B and Part C. The results for the remaining parts are in different
summaries. They can be found online at www.trialsummaries.com if you enter
the protocol number stated above.
The participants in Parts B and C of the study were 20 to 55 years of age when
they joined.
These parts of the study included 36 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, also
called T2DM. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with T2DM, the body does not make enough insulin and does not
respond to insulin in the way that it should. Insulin is a hormone that controls
the level of blood sugar. T2DM causes blood sugar levels to rise to levels that
are higher than normal. This can cause medical problems.
The study drug, MEDI7219, is being developed to treat T2DM. It works by
increasing the release of insulin into the blood after eating and helps to
decrease blood sugar levels in people with T2DM.
Drugs of the same type as MEDI7219 are usually given through a needle into
the skin. In Part B and Part C of the study, the researchers wanted to learn about
the safety of MEDI7219 when it is given through a needle into a vein, also called
an IV infusion, and when it is taken as a tablet by mouth. For the tablets, the
researchers combined MEDI7219 with substances that help protect the tablet
from stomach acid, and with substances that help it get into the blood. The
combination of the study drug with other substances is called a formulation.
