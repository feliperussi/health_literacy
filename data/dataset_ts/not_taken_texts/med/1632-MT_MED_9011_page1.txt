Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: Osimertinib and fexofenadine
Short Study Title: A study to learn how fexofenadine acts in the body when taken
alone compared to when taken with osimertinib, and if the 2 drugs
are safe to take together
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drugs osimertinib and fexofenadine. The
study started in March 2017 and ended in July 2017.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with you and the public. An independent, nonprofit organization called CISCRP
helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you understand and
feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if osimertinib affected how fexofenadine acted in the body.
Both of these drugs are commonly used on their own, but researchers wanted to know how
they acted when they were taken together. Osimertinib is an approved cancer drug, and
fexofenadine is an approved allergy drug.
In this study, the researchers also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study. This information is important to know before other drugs that
are similar to fexofenadine can be taken together with osimertinib.
