Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
Not all of the participants took every dose of olaparib. So, some of the results for
each dose below do not include all 18 participants.

None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during this study.
None of the participants died because of serious adverse reactions during this study.
