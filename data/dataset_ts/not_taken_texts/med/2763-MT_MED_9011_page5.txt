Clinical Trial RESULTS
WHAT WERE THE STUDY RESULTS?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions researchers asked during
the study.
Did RDEA3170 capsules give participants as much medicine as
RDEA3170 tablets?
Yes. The amount of RDEA3170 in the body was higher for all 3 types of capsules
compared to RDEA3170 tablets.
In Group 1, participants had about 61% more RDEA3170 in the body after taking
the 5 mg capsules and about 59% more RDEA3170 in the body after taking the 10 mg
capsules compared to the tablets.
In Group 2, participants had about 31% more RDEA3170 in the body after taking the
10 mg capsules compared to the tablets.
