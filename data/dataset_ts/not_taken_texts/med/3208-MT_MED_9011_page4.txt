How much BGF got into the participants’ lungs?
On average, 37.7% of the BGF got into the participants’ lungs. This was measured
after the participants used the inhaler and then held their breath for 10 seconds.
Participants held their breath to make sure that as much BGF as possible stayed
in the lungs after they breathed out again. The doctors used a scan called “gamma
scintigraphy imaging” to measure how much BGF got into the lungs.

It is important to know the study was designed to get the most accurate results when
the participants held their breath for 10 seconds. But, the doctors also measured how
much BGF got into lungs after the participants held their breath for 3 seconds. On
average, 34.5% of the BGF from the inhaler got into the participants’ lungs after they
held their breath for 3 seconds.
