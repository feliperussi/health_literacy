Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have heart disease.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how it works and how safe it is.
Stable coronary heart disease, also called stable CHD, is a condition that happens
when there is a buildup of cholesterol in the heart arteries. This buildup can cause
heart attack, stroke, and other medical problems. Currently, there is no cure for
stable CHD.
In the body, there are 2 different types of cholesterol. There is 1 type known as “low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol”, also called LDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is “bad
cholesterol” and can clog arteries and blood vessels. The other type is “high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol”, also called HDL cholesterol. This type is “good cholesterol”
and helps to remove bad cholesterol from the blood.
Some available treatments to help control stable CHD work by increasing the HDL
levels or decreasing the LDL levels in the blood. But these treatments may not help
some people who have stable CHD, and may cause medical problems.
The study drug, MEDI5884, is being developed to help people who have stable
CHD by increasing the HDL levels in the blood. In this study, the researchers
wanted to learn about the safety of different doses of MEDI5884.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants have changes in the results of their health tests and
measurements during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men
and women who had stable CHD and were already taking heart medicine to help
control their cholesterol levels. The participants in this study were 45 to 80 years
old when they joined.
