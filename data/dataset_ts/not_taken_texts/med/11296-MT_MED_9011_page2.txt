Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of Japanese men and women with obesity and
type 2 diabetes mellitus, also called T2DM. The participants in this study were 34
to 69 years old when they joined.
The study included 16 participants in Japan.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat obesity and T2DM. Before a
drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find
out how safe it is and how it works.
T2DM is a condition that causes high levels of blood sugar, also called glucose. In
people with T2DM, a hormone called insulin does not work as well as it does in
people without T2DM. When insulin works properly, it helps keep the blood sugar
levels from getting too high. Some people with T2DM also have obesity, which can
contribute to their health problems. In people with T2DM, weight loss may help to
lower blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of having other health problems.
The study drug, cotadutide, was designed to lower blood sugar levels by helping
the body to produce more insulin. It also slows digestion and reduces appetite,
which may lead to some weight loss.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of cotadutide in
Japanese participants with obesity and T2DM.
