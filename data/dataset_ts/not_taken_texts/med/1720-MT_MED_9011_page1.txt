Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug MEDI4276.
You and all the participants helped researchers learn more about using MEDI4276 to help
people with advanced breast or stomach cancer.
MedImmune sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent,
non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you.
We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 42 weeks. But, the entire study took about
2.5 years to finish. The study started in September 2015 and ended in May 2018. The study
included 47 participants in the United States.
The researchers planned to include up to 216 participants in this study. But, the researchers
ended the study early because MEDI4276 was not shrinking the participantsâ€™ tumors enough,
the participants had medical problems, and the results of the study were not as expected.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
