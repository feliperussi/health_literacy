Clinical Study Results
The participants who took SZC started by taking a dose of 5 g. The doctors studied the
participants’ blood potassium levels every week during the first 4 weeks. If a participant’s
potassium levels did not improve, the doctors could increase the SZC dose up to a total of
15 g over the course of these 4 weeks. The dose that each participant was taking at the
end of these first 4 weeks was the same dose that he or she took for the next 4 weeks.
Throughout the study, the doctors took blood samples and checked the participants’
blood potassium levels.
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the
doctors checked the participants’ blood potassium levels and asked them how they were
feeling.
