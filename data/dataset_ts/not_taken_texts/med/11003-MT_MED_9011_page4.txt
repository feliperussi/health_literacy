What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at
the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
How did the treatments affect lung function of the participants?
In general, treatments of budesonide and formoterol fumarate together using MDI
improved lung function of the participants more than the treatments with either
budesonide or formoterol fumarate alone using MDI.
To answer this question, the researchers measured participantsâ€™ lung function
before and after they took the inhaler treatments.
These amounts of air were measured in milliliters, or mL.
