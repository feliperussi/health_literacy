Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. These
medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. The
websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened in this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during the study. None of the
participants died during the study.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
None of the participants had adverse reactions during the study. None of the
participants stopped taking the study treatments because of adverse reactions they had
during the study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
These results helped the researchers compare the study pain relief patch to an
approved pain relief patch for reducing injection site pain.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with the study pain relief patch are not planned.
