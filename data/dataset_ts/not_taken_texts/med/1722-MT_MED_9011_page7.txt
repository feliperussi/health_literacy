This study helped researchers learn more about how MEDI6012 works in people with
cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with MEDI6012 are planned.
