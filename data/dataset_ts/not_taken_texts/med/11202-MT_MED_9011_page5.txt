Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant
had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 4 participants who left the study before completing all parts. But, the
researchers were able to study the below results for 2 of those 4 participants. So, some
of the below results are for 18 out of the 20 participants.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the

How did savolitinib act in the body when taken with rifampicin?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants
during Parts 1, 2, and 3.
In these samples, they measured:
• the average total amount of the study drugs in the blood
• the average highest amount of the study drugs in the blood
The researchers compared the results from when the participants took savolitinib only to
when they took savolitinib and rifampicin. This information may help future researchers
determine what other drugs can be given with savolitinib.
The researchers found that the average total and highest amounts of savolitinib in the
blood were lower when taken with rifampicin.
