Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of people with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell
lung cancer, also called NSCLC. The participants in this study were 22 to 87 years old when they
joined. Some of the participants may have already tried treatments for their cancer. All of the
participants had “advanced” cancer. This usually means that the cancer keeps growing even with
treatment.
The study included 457 participants in Australia, Belgium, France, Italy, South Korea, Spain,
Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced NSCLC. Before a drug can be
approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it
works.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form
tumors. Normally, the immune system fights infections or anything it does not recognize, and
can help stop tumors from growing. But in people with advanced NSCLC, a protein on the tumor
cells can interact with certain proteins on the immune cells. This stops the immune cells from
recognizing tumor cells and being able to fight them.
The study drugs, MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, were each designed to stop the tumor cells
from interacting with some of these proteins. This lets the immune cells recognize the tumor cells
again and help stop the tumor from growing.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI4736 with
tremelimumab in participants with advanced NSCLC.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
• Did MEDI4736 with tremelimumab slow the growth of the participants’ tumors?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find
out if MEDI4736 with tremelimumab helps improve the health of people with advanced NSCLC.
