Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before and after a
drug is approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab works in a large
number of participants with severe asthma. They also wanted to find out if the
participants had any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow and causes
inflammation in the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have
asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
Severe asthma can be treated with a type of treatment called oral corticosteroids.
But, oral corticosteroids can have side effects that affect the health and quality of
life of people living with severe asthma.
The study drug, benralizumab, was designed to help treat asthma by reducing
the number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are a type of white blood
cell that helps to fight disease. Having a high number of eosinophils can lead to
inflammation in the lungs and can contribute to asthma. The researchers think that
benralizumab may help to treat the participantsâ€™ asthma and allow the doctors to
lower their dose of oral corticosteroids.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab affected the
dose of oral corticosteroids that the participants needed to control their asthma.
They also wanted to learn if taking a lower dose of oral corticosteroids or no oral
corticosteroids and getting benralizumab helped the participants control their
asthma symptoms and helped their quality of life.
