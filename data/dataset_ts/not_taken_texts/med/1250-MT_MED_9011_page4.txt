Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, the doctors checked the overall health
of the participants to make sure that they could join the study.
The doctors:
• did a physical exam
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• did a chest X-ray
• did a blood test to make sure the participants did not have tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis
or were pregnant
• checked the participants’ lupus symptoms
• reviewed the participants’ lupus and other medications
During the study, the participants visited the study site once every 4 weeks, for a total
of 13 visits.
At each visit, the doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked the participants’ overall health
• checked the participants’ skin for signs of lupus and checked their joints to see if they
were tender or swollen
• gave the participants anifrolumab or the placebo through IV infusion
At some visits, the doctors did an ECG or took blood samples.
Throughout the study, the doctors asked the participants to complete different
questionnaires about how they were feeling.
