Clinical Study Results

event is any medical problem that happens during the study. Adverse events are
considered “serious” when they are life-threatening, cause lasting problems, or require
hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the study drugs. This section
talks about adverse events that happened during the study. Some of these adverse
events are also included in the “What medical problems did participants have during the
