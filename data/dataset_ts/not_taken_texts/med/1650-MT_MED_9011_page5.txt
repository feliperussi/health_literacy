Clinical Trial Results
Did participants who got MEDI9929 have less severe AD after 12 weeks of
treatment than participants who got a placebo?
To answer this question, study doctors used a scoring system to look at how severe
participantsâ€™ AD symptoms were. A higher score meant the AD symptoms were
more severe.
Researchers counted the number of participants who had at least a 50% decrease in
their score from before treatment to after treatment. Researchers measured these results
for 51 participants who got MEDI9929 and 54 participants who got the placebo.
They found that 33 of the 51 participants (64.7%) who got MEDI9929 had at least a
50% decrease in their score compared to 26 of the 54 participants (48.1%) who got the
placebo. Overall, researchers found that the difference between the treatment groups
was too small for researchers to know if one treatment was better than the other.
The graph below shows the percentage of participants in each treatment group who
had at least a 50% decrease in their score after 12 weeks of treatment.
