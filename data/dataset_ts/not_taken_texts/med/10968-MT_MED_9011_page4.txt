Durvalumab, oleclumab, monalizumab, and danvatirsen were all designed to help
the immune cells stop tumors from growing. Although all these drugs work in
slightly different ways, they all act on the immune system. These types of drugs
are called “immunotherapy”.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well durvalumab, when given
alone or with another treatment, works in participants with early stage NSCLC.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did durvalumab, when given alone or with another treatment, reduce the
number of tumor cells in participants with non-small cell lung cancer?
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if durvalumab, oleclumab, monalizumab, and danvatirsen help
improve the health of people with NSCLC.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got either durvalumab alone, or durvalumab
with 1 other study drug: oleclumab, monalizumab, or danvatirsen.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
