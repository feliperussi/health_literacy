Clinical Study Results
Did the 2 forms of MEDI0382 act in a similar way in the participants’
blood?
No. The average amount of the 2 forms of MEDI0382 in the participants’ blood
was considered to be similar. The highest amount of the 2 forms of MEDI0382 in
the blood was not considered to be similar. Both the average and highest amounts
of MEDI0382 were higher when the participants took Form 3. But, the difference
between the average amounts was considered to be too small for the researchers to
consider this difference to be meaningful.
To answer this question, the researchers compared these averages by using a ratio.
A ratio is a calculation that is used to compare 2 drug amounts to one another. In
clinical studies, if the ratio between 2 amounts of a drug in the blood are:
• between 80% and 125%, the amounts are considered to be similar
• lower than 80% or higher than 125%, the amounts are not considered to be similar
The amounts of MEDI0382 in the blood were measured 2 days after the participants
got each form.
Average amount of MEDI0382 in the blood
• The ratio between Form 3 and Form 2 was 109.9%. This means there was about 10%
more MEDI0382 in the blood when the participants got Form 3 compared to when they
got Form 2.
• The researchers considered these amounts to be similar.
Highest amount of MEDI0382 in the blood
• The ratio between Form 3 and Form 2 was 125.7%. This means there was about 26%
more MEDI0382 in the blood when the participants got Form 3 compared to when they
got Form 2.
• The researchers did not consider these amounts to be similar.
