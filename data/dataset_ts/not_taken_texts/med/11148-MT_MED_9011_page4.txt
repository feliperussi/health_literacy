What happened during this study?
The study started in July 2019 and ended in February 2020.
The researchers planned for this study to have 4 parts. But, the researchers
stopped the study early after the first part finished. This was because of safety
concerns about AZD6615 from other studies that were done in animals.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This part of the study lasted up to 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors
made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood and urine samples
X measured the participants’ blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known
as an “ECG”
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they stayed at their study site
for 5 days. They took their dose of study treatment on the second day. They also
wore an electronic device to monitor their heart health.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 6
times. This part of the study lasted for up to 12 weeks. At these visits, the study
doctors checked the health of the participants.
