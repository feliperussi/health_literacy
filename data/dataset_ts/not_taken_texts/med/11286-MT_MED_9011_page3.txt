What treatments did the participants take?
There were 5 forms of AZD5718 in this study. There were 2 forms that contained
a lower dose of AZD5718, and 3 forms that contained a higher dose of AZD5718.
All of the forms were taken as tablets by mouth.
The participants took all 5 forms. First, they took the 2 forms that contained the
lower dose of AZD5718. Then, the researchers studied the results. Once they
determined that the dose was safe, the researchers gave the participants the 3
forms that contained the higher dose of AZD5718.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
