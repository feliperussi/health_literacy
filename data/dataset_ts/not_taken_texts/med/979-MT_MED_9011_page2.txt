Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with type 2 diabetes.
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin works in a large
number of participants with type 2 diabetes who already have damaged kidneys.
They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during
the study.
The body does not use insulin normally in people with type 2 diabetes. This
makes the amount of sugar, also called glucose, in the blood too high. High
blood sugar levels can lead to several medical problems in people with
type 2 diabetes, such as kidney damage.
Dapagliflozin is a drug that is already approved to treat type 2 diabetes. In
this study, the researchers wanted to learn how dapagliflozin affects the blood
sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes who already have damaged kidneys.
Dapagliflozin stops the kidneys from absorbing sugar before it leaves the body.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did dapagliflozin affect the blood sugar levels of participants?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of
men and women with type 2 diabetes who already had damaged kidneys. The
participants in this study were 43 to 74 years of age.
What kind of study was this?
Part 1 of this study was “single-blind”. This means the researchers
knew what the participants were taking but the participants did not. All of the
participants took a placebo in Part 1. A placebo looks like a drug but does not
have any medicine in it. The researchers used a placebo to help make sure
any of the effects they saw in the participants who took the drug in Part 2 were
actually caused by the drug.
