Clinical Study Results
The researchers kept track of the severity of the participants’ RA by using the Disease
Activity Score, also called DAS. The DAS is a score based on the results of several tests
and measurements. A higher score means more severe RA.
The researchers used the following information to calculate the participants’ DAS:
• number of swollen and tender joints
• amount of swelling in the body
• surveys asking the participants to rate how RA was affecting their daily activities
After the participants took study treatment for 2 weeks, the researchers found that the
participants who took AZD9567 and the participants who took prednisolone had a decrease
in their DAS. The researchers considered this decrease to be similar for both groups.
After the participants took study treatment for 2 weeks, the researchers found that:
• The participants who took AZD9567 had an average decrease in their DAS of
1.9 points.
• The participants who took prednisolone had an average decrease in their DAS of
2.4 points.
The figure below shows these results.
