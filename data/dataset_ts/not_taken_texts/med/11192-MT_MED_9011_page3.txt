Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with long-standing, severe
COPD. The participants in this study were 50 to 76 years old when they joined.
Before joining this study, the participants:
X were taking at least 2 long-term treatments for COPD
X had lung health tests showing that their COPD was severe
X were current or former smokers with at least a 10-year history of smoking often
The study included 35 participants in Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat long-standing, severe COPD.
Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if BFF MDI worked better than
BFF DPI in a small number of participants with long-standing, severe COPD.
COPD is a lung disease that causes blocked airways and inflammation, making it
hard for air to flow in and out of the lungs. It also causes shortness of breath. COPD
gets worse over time. Most people who have COPD are current or former smokers.
BFF DPI is an approved treatment that is commonly used by people with COPD. It
works by expanding the airways in the lungs and reducing inflammation. This can
help people with COPD breathe more easily.
In this study, BFF could be taken through 2 different types of inhalers: an MDI or a
DPI. They are both devices that deliver a specific amount of a drug for a patient to
breathe in. They are different in how patients take them and how patients breathe
in when using the device.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much air the participants
could breathe out after a week of taking BFF delivered through either an MDI or
DPI. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems
during the study.
