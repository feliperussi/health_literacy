How did AZD8871 act in the body?
Researchers wanted to learn how the study drug acted in the body. They
wanted to know:
• The average amount of AZD8871 in the blood
• The highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood
• How long it took for AZD8871 to reach its highest
amount in the blood
• How long it took for AZD8871 to reach steady levels
in the blood
The average amount of AZD8871 in the blood
Researchers measured the average amount of AZD8871 in participants’
blood for the 3 study drug doses of 300 μg, 600 μg, and 900 μg on both
Day 1 and Day 16.
Overall, researchers found the following:
• On Day 1, higher doses of AZD8871 led to participants having larger
average amounts of the study drug in their blood.
• On Day 16, higher doses of AZD8871 led to participants having larger
average amounts of the study drug in their blood. As researchers
expected, all 3 average amounts for the 300 μg, 600 μg, and 900 μg
doses were higher on Day 16 than they were on Day 1.
