What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions that researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed
at the end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it
can also be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
What adverse events of special interest did the participants have during
the study?
The study doctors kept track of the adverse events of special interest that the
participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An
adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Other studies with durvalumab showed that the participants in those studies had
certain adverse events. The researchers wanted to learn if the participants getting
durvalumab in this study also had these adverse events. These are known as
“adverse events of special interest”.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. Adverse events
may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of research is
needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
The table on the next page summarizes the adverse events of special interest that
happened in at least 5.0% of participants. This data is for all 867 participants who
got durvalumab.
