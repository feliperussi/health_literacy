What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How many participants’ tumors disappeared or shrank after receiving
AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
X How many participants’ prostate-specific antigen levels decreased significantly
after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
X What medical problems happened during this study
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab helps improve
the health of people with prostate cancer.
