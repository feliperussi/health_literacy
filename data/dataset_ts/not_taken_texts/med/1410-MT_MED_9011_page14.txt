What treatments did the participants get
during Parts 2 and 3?
Participants could enter Parts 2 and 3 of the study if they had not done well
with sorafenib, another treatment commonly used in advanced HCC. There
were 332 participants in Parts 2 and 3. The participants got durvalumab on its
own, tremelimumab on its own, or both durvalumab and tremelimumab. The
participants continued getting study treatment until they left the study or until the
study doctors thought it was no longer helping them.
Parts 2 and 3 were “open-label”. Open-label means the participants, researchers,
study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting. A
computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
Durvalumab and tremelimumab were given as an injection into a vein, also called
an IV infusion. The doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of body
weight, also known as “mg/kg”.
