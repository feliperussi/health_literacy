The researchers compared the average ACQ-6 scores before and after 1 year of
treatment. They compared the results for the participants who got tezepelumab
to those for the participants who got the placebo. A decrease in average ACQ-6
score meant that the participants felt that study treatment helped control their
asthma.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average ACQ-6 score was:
> a decrease of 1.53 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> a decrease of 1.20 for the participants who got the placebo
ASD
The participants completed the ASD twice a day. The ASD asks about 5 main
asthma symptoms in the morning and 5 main asthma symptoms at night. The
participants received scores from 0 to 4 for each main symptom based on their
responses. A low score on the ASD meant that the participant’s asthma symptoms
were minor. A high score meant that the participant’s asthma symptoms were
severe.
The researchers calculated the average ASD scores before and after 1 year of
treatment. They compared the results for the participants who got tezepelumab to
those for the participants who got the placebo. A decrease in average ASD score
meant that the participants felt that study treatment helped their asthma symptoms.
Overall, the researchers found that the change in average ASD score were:
> a decrease of 0.70 for the participants who got tezepelumab
> a decrease of 0.59 for the participants who got the placebo
What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
