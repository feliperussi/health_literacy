Part B
In Part B, the only medical problems that were not considered serious that happened in at least
2 participants in any treatment group were common cold (13.2%), COPD (10.5%), and headache.
One participant (2.6%) had at least 1 medical problem that researchers thought was possibly related
to treatment. This participant got only tiotropium in this study. This possibly related medical problem
was headache (31.6%).

How did AZD8871 affect the body?
Researchers wanted to learn how AZD8871 affected the body. Researchers measured participants’
breathing to find out if their breathing improved during the study.
Part A
Overall, researchers found that:
• In Part A, participants who got higher doses of AZD8871 had improved breathing.
• In Part A, participants’ breathing improved quickly and stayed improved for up to
36 hours when they got AZD8871.
• In Part A, participants’ breathing improved more when they got the 200ug dose or higher
doses of AZD8871 compared to the placebo.
