Clinical Trial Results
Another part of this study was planned, but it was not done. Instead, another study is being planned
in its place.
During Part A, all participants visited the study site up to 21 days before taking the study drug.
At this visit, study doctors made sure that participants could join the study. On Day 1 of the study,
participants took 1 dose of the study drug or the placebo on an empty stomach. Participants stayed
at the study site for 2 days after taking the study drug on Day 1. Doctors at the study site took blood
and urine samples every few hours after participants took the study drug. Participants left the study
site on Day 3. About 7 to 10 days after taking the study drug, participants came back to the study
site for a follow-up visit.
Which treatment participants took was determined by chance, like rolling dice. Participants had a
2 in 3 chance of taking AZD4831 and a 1 in 3 chance of taking the placebo. Overall, 30 participants
took AZD4831, and 10 participants took the placebo during Part A.
Participants who took AZD4831 each took 1 of 5 doses:
• 5 milligrams, or mg, AZD4831
• 15 mg AZD4831
• 45 mg AZD4831
• 135 mg AZD4831
• 405 mg AZD4831
The figure below shows how Part A of the study was done.

Part B started after Part A ended. During Part B, 4 participants who took the 45 mg dose of
AZD4831 during Part A came back to the study site. Participants then took another 45 mg dose of
AZD4831 with a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast on Day 1. Participants stayed at the study site for 2
days after taking the study drug on Day 1. Doctors at the study site took blood and urine samples
every few hours after participants took the study drug. About 7 to 10 days after taking the study
drug, participants came back to the study site for a follow-up visit.
