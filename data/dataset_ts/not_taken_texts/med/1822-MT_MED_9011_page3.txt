Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. Researchers look
at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest.
Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a
doctor before making any treatment change.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have a full report of the
study results.
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
The medical problems the participants had in this study are not in this summary.
Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out
helps protect their identities.
The medical problems that participants have during clinical studies that the doctors
think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems,
or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened in this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
