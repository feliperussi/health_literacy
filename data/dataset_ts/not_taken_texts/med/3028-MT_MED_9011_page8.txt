Did durvalumab alone or together with tremelimumab, with
chemotherapy, help the participants live longer than chemotherapy
alone?
Overall, the researchers found that the participants who got durvalumab with
chemotherapy did live longer than those who got chemotherapy alone. The
participants who got durvalumab and tremelimumab with chemotherapy did not
live longer than those who got chemotherapy alone.
To answer this question, the researchers counted the average number of months
the participants lived during and after the study. They did this at 2 different times
to get 2 different sets of results. The first time was in April 2019 and the second
time was in March 2020.
When the researchers looked at the results in April 2019, they compared the
participants who got durvalumab with chemotherapy with those who got
chemotherapy alone.
In April 2019, the researchers found that the participants lived for an average of:
> 13.0 months after getting durvalumab with chemotherapy
> 10.3 months after getting chemotherapy alone
