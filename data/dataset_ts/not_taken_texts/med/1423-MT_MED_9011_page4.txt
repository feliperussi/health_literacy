Clinical Study Results
The table below shows the treatments the participants got in this study, as well as the lowest and
highest number of cycles the participants received. The table also includes the median number of
cycles in each group. A median is the middle number in a set of numbers and is found between
the lowest and highest numbers.
Group Treatment given Cycle length Number of cycles
Group 1 • 20 mg/kg of durvalumab 1 4 weeks 1 to 38 cycles
(durvalumab alone) time each cycle (median of 4 cycles)
369 participants
Group 2 • 20 mg/kg of durvalumab 1 4 weeks 1 to 41 cycles
(durvalumab and time each cycle for 4 cycles (median of 4 cycles)
tremelimumab)

371 participants
1 time each cycle for 4 cycles
• after 4 cycles, 20 mg/kg of
durvalumab 1 time each cycle
Group 3 • SOC treatment 1 time during 3 weeks 1 to 46 cycles

What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the participants visited their study site 1 time over the course of
4 weeks. At this visit, the doctors checked to make sure they could join the study. The doctors:
• did a physical examination
• asked the participants about their medical history and what medicines they were taking
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• measured the participants’ tumors using computed tomography scans, also called CT scans,
and magnetic resonance imaging scans, also called MRI scans
• took tissue samples and pictures of the tumors
• gave the participants surveys that asked them about their symptoms and how they were feeling
The doctors also did these tests, surveys, and measurements throughout the study.
