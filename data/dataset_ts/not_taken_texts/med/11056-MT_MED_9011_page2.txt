Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a treatment can be
approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and
how it works.
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow. This can make it
difficult to breathe. People who have asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of
breath.
There are treatments that can help people who have asthma manage their symptoms.
But, these treatments may not help some people control their symptoms and may cause
medical problems.
The study drug, tezepelumab, is being developed as a treatment for asthma.
Researchers think that tezepelumab may help people who have asthma to better manage
their symptoms.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the levels of tezepelumab in the
blood when the drug was injected by 3 different methods.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• What were the levels of tezepelumab in the blood when the drug was injected by
3 different methods?
• What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to find out whether the 3 different injection
methods of tezepelumab perform in the same way.
