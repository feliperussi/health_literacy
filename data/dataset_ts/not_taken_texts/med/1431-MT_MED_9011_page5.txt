Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in April 2016 and ended in November 2019.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site at least 1
time. Some participants may have had more than 1 visit. At these visits, the study doctors
checked the health of the participants to make sure they could join the study. This part of
the study lasted up to 4 weeks. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical
problems they were having
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an
ECG
• took pictures of each participant’s tumors using CT or MRI scans
• used surgery to take a sample of the tumor called a biopsy for some participants
• took blood and urine samples
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time at the
beginning of each cycle.
At each visit, they got durvalumab, tremelimumab, and chemotherapy by IV infusion. The
participants in Part B of Group 6 only got tremelimumab during their first and last cycle of
the study.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site once a month
for the first 3 months. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants. After the first 3 months, the study doctors called the participants every 3
months until the study ended.
For participants who left the study early, the study doctors checked the participants’
tumors regularly until their cancer got worse.
