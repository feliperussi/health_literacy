Clinical Study Results
The participants in this study were either in the vaccine group and took the
MEDI3250 vaccine, or in the placebo group and took a placebo. A placebo looks like
a vaccine but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help
make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the vaccine are
actually caused by the vaccine.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the group each participant was
in. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each group is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors gave the participants a physical exam,
including checking their temperature. The doctors also asked the participants about
their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
The doctors made sure the participants did not have the flu before they were given
the MEDI3250 vaccine or placebo.
During the study, the participants visited their study site once. They took 1 dose of
either the MEDI3250 vaccine or the placebo as a nasal spray. For the first 2 week s
after this visit, the study site staff called the participants either every day or every other
day to ask them about their health and symptoms. After that, the study site staff called
the participants once a month until the end of the study to ask them about their health
and symptoms. Participants got a total of up to 20 phone calls during the study.
