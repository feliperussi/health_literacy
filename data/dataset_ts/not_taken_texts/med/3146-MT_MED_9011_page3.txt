Clinical Study Results
All of the participants were taking either metformin or metformin and dapagliflozin together before
the study started. During the study, the participants took both metformin and dapagliflozin as
tablets by mouth.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the study treatment each participant got. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results
of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time over
the course of about 2 months. During this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the
participants could join the study.
The study doctors:
• did a physical examination
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants’ blood sugar levels
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they
were taking
During the study, the participants visited their study site 10 times over the course of about
2 months. During this time, the study doctors checked the participants’ overall health and blood
sugar levels, and asked them how they were feeling.
The participants visited their study site 2 times during the first month. During this time:
• The participants who had been taking only metformin before joining the study began taking
dapagliflozin as well.
• The participants who had been taking metformin and dapagliflozin together before joining the study
continued taking both drugs.
• The participants did not get any MEDI0382.
During the second month, the participants visited their study site 8 times. During this time, they
got 1 of the below treatments each day:
• 25 participants got MEDI0382, metformin, and dapagliflozin
• 24 participants got the placebo, metformin, and dapagliflozin
