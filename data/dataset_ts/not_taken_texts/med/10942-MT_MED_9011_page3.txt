Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, study doctors
or other study staff knew what treatment each participant got.
In this study, MEDI0382 was compared with a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug
but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make
sure that any of the effects they see in the participants who get the study drug are
actually related to the study drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that
comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
During the study, the participants got MEDI0382 or the placebo once a day
through a needle under the skin, also called an injection. Some injections were
given at the study site, and some were done by the participants at home. The
doses of MEDI0382 were measured in micrograms, also known as μg.
There were 2 groups in this study. Each group got either the placebo or increasing
doses of MEDI0382 for up to 8 weeks. The chart below shows the treatments in
each group.
