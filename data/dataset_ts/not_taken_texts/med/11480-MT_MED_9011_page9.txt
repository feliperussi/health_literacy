What medical problems happened during
this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had
during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study
treatments. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments.
A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse
reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed
together with all of the available data for AZD9567 and prednisolone.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
This section does not include information from the 2 participants who did not
take all of their doses of study treatment. This was 1 participant from Group 1,
and 1 participant from Group 2.
