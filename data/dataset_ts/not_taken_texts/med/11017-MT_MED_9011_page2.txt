Overview
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have a type of heart
failure called HFrEF. Researchers already did studies that showed dapagliflozin
worked for people with HFrEF who were in those studies. In this study, the
researchers wanted to find out more about how dapagliflozin works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a
treatment but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> After 16 weeks, did the participants feel that dapagliflozin helped their
overall heart failure symptoms?
Yes. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin felt that it helped their
overall heart failure symptoms after 16 weeks.
> After 16 weeks, did the participants feel that dapagliflozin helped their
physical symptoms caused by heart failure?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin did not feel that it helped
their physical symptoms caused by heart failure after 16 weeks.
> After 16 weeks, could the participants who took dapagliflozin walk farther
in 6 minutes?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin could not walk farther in 6
minutes after 16 weeks.
