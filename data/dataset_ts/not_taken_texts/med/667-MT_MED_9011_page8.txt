What medical problems happened during this
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to olaparib. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered
“serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital
care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by olaparib. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These adverse
reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the
available data for olaparib.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
There was 1 participant who did not take the study drug, so the results below
include only 271 of the 272 participants.
