Clinical Study Results
Did MEDI0382 affect the participants’ weight?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants in all 4 treatment groups
lost weight after getting treatment. They also found that the participants who got
MEDI0382 lost more weight compared to the participants who got the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the participants’ weight before
they got treatment, and at the end of the study. Then, the researchers compared
the percent change in these measurements.
The researchers found that after 7 weeks of treatment, the participants in:
• Group 1, who got the lowest dose of MEDI0382, had an average decrease in
their weight of 2.1%.
• Group 2, who got the middle dose of MEDI0382, had an average decrease in
their weight of 3.3%.
• Group 3, who got the highest dose of MEDI0382, had an average decrease in
their weight of 3.3%.
• Group 4, who got the placebo, had an average decrease in their weight of
0.8%.
The figure below shows these results.
