Clinical Study Results
How did ZS affect the sodium levels in the urine?
In general, the researchers found that ZS decreased sodium levels in the urine.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the sodium levels in the
urine of participants several times each day during the study. They compared
the participants’ urine sodium levels before and after treatment. The sodium
levels were measured in mmol/24 h.
At the end of the treatment period, the researchers found that:
• The participants who took 5 g of ZS had an average decrease of
11.5 mmol/24 h in their urine sodium levels compared to before treatment.
• The participants who took 10 g of ZS had an average decrease of
5.1 mmol/24 h in their urine sodium levels compared to before treatment.
The figure below shows these results.
