Clinical trial results
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “single-blind” study. This means that none of the
participants knew which treatment each participant got but the study staff
did. In this study, participants got either the study drug or the placebo. Your
study included 24 healthy male volunteers who were 18 to 55 years old.
What happened during the study?
You and the other participants were in the study for up to about 8 weeks
and visited the study site 3 times.
The first visit was a screening visit to make sure you and the other
participants were healthy enough to take part in the study. Study doctors
did a physical exam, took blood and urine samples, and did other tests to
make sure you and the other participants could join the study.
During the second visit, you and the other participants got doses of
AZD8871 or the placebo. You and the other participants stayed at the
study site for 21 days. You got doses on Day 1 and then again from Day 5
to Day 16.
The third visit happened 5 to 7 days after the second visit, so the
study doctors and staff could follow up with you to make sure you
were still healthy.
