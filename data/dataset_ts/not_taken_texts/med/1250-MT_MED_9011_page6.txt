Clinical Study Results
Did anifrolumab improve the participants’ lupus symptoms that were the
focus of the study?
No. Anifrolumab did not improve the participants’ lupus symptoms that were the focus of
the study, when given with the participants’ usual lupus treatment.
During the study, the doctors were asked to complete a number of questionnaires about
all of the lupus symptoms that the participants had and their effects on them, such
as on pain or on the skin. The researchers used all of these measurements from the
questionnaires to calculate a “disease activity score”. If the participants’ disease activity
scores were reduced by 4 or more points, it meant that they had fewer lupus symptoms. If
this happened, they were considered “SLE responders.”
The researchers found that, after 52 weeks of getting study treatment:
• 36.2% of participants who got 300 mg anifrolumab were SLE responders. This was
65 out of 180 participants.
• 40.4% of the participants who got the placebo were SLE responders. This was
74 out of 184 participants.
