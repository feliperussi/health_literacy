Clinical trial results
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in June 2016 and ended in November 2016. It
included 24 participants at 1 study site in the United Kingdom. When the
study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Before patients can take a new drug, the company developing it must do
research studies to show that the drug is safe and effective. The first step
in studying a new drug is to test it in healthy people. This means people
without any serious health problems.
The study drug, AZD8871, is being developed to treat COPD and possibly
other lung diseases like asthma. COPD is a lung disease that causes a
chronic inflammation of the lungs that creates a blockage of the airways
and makes it difficult to breathe. Asthma is a lung disease that can cause
coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. COPD
and asthma are both diseases that make it hard to breathe.
In this study, researchers wanted to see if AZD8871 causes any medical
problems, how AZD8871 acted in the body, and how long it took for
AZD8871 to reach steady levels in the blood. A drug reaches a steady
level in the blood when the amount of the drug going into the body
is the same as the amount of the drug that the body gets rid of.
Researchers compared 3 different doses of AZD8871 to a placebo.
A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.
Researchers use placebos in studies to compare the results for
participants who get study drugs with the results for participants who
get no medicine at all. Researchers wanted to know:
• What medical problems did participants have after they
got AZD8871?
• How did AZD8871 act in the body?
• How long did it take for AZD8871 to reach steady levels
in the blood?
