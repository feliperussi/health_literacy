This section is a summary of all the adverse events in Part 1. An adverse event is
considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the
participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the drugs in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event. Later in this
document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the study doctors
thought might be related to the study drugs in Part 1.
