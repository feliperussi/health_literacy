Clinical Study Results
Counting the number of DLTs helps researchers determine the safety of different
doses of a treatment. This helps them find the highest dose that the participants
can take.
There were 18 participants who did not complete the DLT measurements. So, the
DLT information was collected for 22 participants.
In this study, 9.1% of the participants had a DLT. This was 2 out of 22 participants.
What medical problems did participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for the drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
