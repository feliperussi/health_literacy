Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited the study site 1
time. This was up to 4 weeks before they started the study. At this visit, the study
doctors checked the participants’ overall health to make sure that they could join
the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked vital signs
• took blood samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history
• checked the participant’s heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• measured the participants’ tumors using CT or MRI scans
• looked at a sample of each participant’s tumor
• asked the participants about any medications they were taking
The study doctors also did physical exams, ECGs, and CT or MRI scans
throughout the study. They also took blood samples and asked the participants
about their medications throughout the study.
During the study, the participants took study treatment based on their treatment
group. They visited the study site up to 5 times per cycle. At some site visits, the
study doctors took urine samples and used a needle to take a sample of the tumor
tissue. This is also called a tumor biopsy.
After taking the last dose of study treatment, the participants visited their
study site at least 2 more times over the next month.
At the first of these visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ health, asked
them about their medications, and took blood and urine samples.
At the next visit, the study doctors asked about the participants’ health and
medications and checked the size of their tumors using a CT scan.
After this, the participants visited the study site or received phone calls from the
study site every 6 weeks or 3 months after their last dose. This happened until they
started a new cancer treatment, their cancer got worse, or they left the study.
