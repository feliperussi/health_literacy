Clinical Trial Results
What’s happened since my study ended?
Your study started in August 2015 and ended in August 2016. The study
included 32 participants at 3 study sites in the United States. When the
study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Even after a drug is approved, research must be done to show that it is safe
and effective when it is used in new ways. The study drug, pramlintide, has
been approved to treat type 1 diabetes. Patients with this disease have
high levels of sugar in their bodies and need to take daily doses of insulin,
a hormone made by the body that helps control blood sugar levels. But,
some patients with type 1 diabetes still have problems lowering their
blood sugar levels.
In this study, researchers wanted to learn if participants could have better
control of their blood sugar levels by taking pramlintide and insulin
together when given in 2 separate pumps. This is a new way of taking
pramlintide, as it was previously given with insulin in a separate injection
before each meal. Researchers also wanted to learn if pramlintide causes
any medical problems when given in a pump.
Researchers compared pramlintide to a placebo. A placebo looks like the
study drug but contains no real medicine. Researchers use a placebo so
that they can compare the results of participants who get study drugs
with the results of participants who get no medicine at all. Researchers
wanted to know:
• Did pramlintide help lower blood sugar levels more than
the placebo?
• Did pramlintide help participants in other ways?
• What medical problems did participants have after they
took pramlintide?
