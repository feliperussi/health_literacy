Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with asthma. Before a
treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out
how it works and how safe it is. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AS
MDI works in a small number of participants with mild to moderate asthma. They also
wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow. This makes it difficult to breathe.
People with asthma can have wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest
tightness. There is currently no cure for asthma, but there are treatments that can help
with the symptoms.
Albuterol sulfate, also known as albuterol, is a standard treatment for asthma. It works
by relaxing muscles in the breathing tubes to allow more air into the lungs. This makes
it easier to breathe. Albuterol is given to asthma patients in an inhaler that delivers a
specific amount of medication to the lungs. The inhaler is known as a metered dose
inhaler. One of the current asthma treatments is called Proventil HFA, also known
as Proventil. This treatment also contains albuterol. In this study, AS MDI contains a
different formulation of albuterol compared to the current treatment.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how different doses of AS MDI work in
people with asthma.
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much air could the participants breathe out after taking AS MDI?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and
women who had asthma for at least 6 months and did not have any other lung condition
or infection. The participants in this study were 20 to 45 years old.
