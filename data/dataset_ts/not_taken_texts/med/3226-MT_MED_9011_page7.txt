What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There were 116 participants in this study. But, the results below are only for the 99
participants who got at least 20 weeks of study treatment, had biopsies of their
airways before and after they took the study treatment and went to an end of
treatment site visit within 8 weeks.
Did tezepelumab reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the
participants’ airways?
To answer this question, the study doctors used surgery to take samples of the
tissue in the participants’ airways. This is called a biopsy. The study doctors used a
microscope to see the different types of inflammation cells in the biopsy samples.
They then counted the number of cells per square millimeter. The researchers
compared the number of cells per square millimeter at the start of the study and
at the end of the study. Then, they calculated the average change in the number
of cells in the participants.
The researchers compared the results between the participants who got
tezepelumab and the participants who got the placebo. They measured this
difference as a ratio. A ratio shows how similar 2 numbers are to each other. The
closer the ratio is to 1.00, the more similar the numbers are.
