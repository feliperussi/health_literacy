Clinical Study Results
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in August 2015 and ended in April 2019. The sponsor reviewed
the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is
a summary of that report.
The study included 120 participants with solid tumors and 10 participants with
SCLC in the United States and Canada.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with solid tumors,
including patients with SCLC. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of adavosertib taken
together with olaparib in participants with solid tumors and participants with SCLC.
The researchers also wanted to know if the participants had any medical problems
during the study.
A solid tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body. SCLC is an
uncommon cancer of the lung. All of the participants in this study had already tried
cancer treatments, but their cancer had come back or gotten worse.
In people whose cancer has not gotten better after previous treatment, certain
proteins help cause the tumor to grow. Adavosertib was designed to stop one of
these proteins from letting the tumor grow and to cause tumor cells to die.
Olaparib is available as a treatment for people with advanced ovarian cancer and
metastatic breast cancer. It works by stopping a protein in the body from allowing
the tumor to grow.
Previous studies have shown that treatment with a combination of adavosertib
and olaparib may be beneficial for people with solid tumors, including people with
SCLC, who have already tried other treatments that did not help their cancer.
