Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
3 times up to 4 weeks before they started the study. At these visits, the study
doctors checked the overall health of the participants to make sure that they could
join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical exam and checked the participants’ vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the participants’ medical history
• asked about the participants’ asthma and any medications they were taking
• measured the participants’ lung health by having them blow into a spirometer
• checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called
an ECG
• gave the participants a questionnaire about their asthma
The doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment as well as their regular asthma
inhaler, they visited their study site 7 times over 24 weeks. At each site visit, the
study doctors checked the health of participants.
At some visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ heart health using an
ECG.
On the days when participants did not visit the study site, they took their treatment
by MDI inhaler every day at home.
