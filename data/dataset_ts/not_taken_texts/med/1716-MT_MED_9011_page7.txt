How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
The results presented here are for a single study. These results helped the
researchers learn how MEDI0382 affects the blood sugar levels and weight in
overweight patients with type 2 diabetes.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Further clinical studies with MEDI0382 are planned.
