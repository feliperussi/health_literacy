What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the
questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the
end of this summary. When a full report of the study results is available, it can also
be found on these websites.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different
results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did tezepelumab reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids needed to
control asthma symptoms?
Overall, the researchers found that the percentage of participants who could
reduce their OCS dose was similar in the tezepelumab group and in the placebo
group. The difference between the groups was too small for the researchers to
know if tezepelumab could reduce the amount of OCS needed to control asthma
symptoms better than the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers calculated how many participants were
able to reduce their dose of OCS after 48 weeks of getting study treatment. The
researchers made categories based on how much participants were able to reduce
their dose of OCS.
The researchers calculated the dose changes as a percentage change. Stopping
OCS was the same as a 100.0% dose reduction. No change in OCS was the same
as a 0.0% dose reduction.
