Clinical Trial Results
Change in how much air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 7 of a
treatment visit
Researchers measured how much air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1 of each
treatment visit. Researchers also measured this amount before treatment on Day 7 of each treatment
visit. Researchers then compared those 2 amounts.
Compared with the amounts of air participants could exhale before treatment on Day 1:
• Participants who took 6 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.08 more liters of air
• Participants who took 12 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.07 more liters of air
• Participants who took 24 µg of formoterol in the inhaler exhaled 0.10 more liters of air
• Participants who took 20 µg of formoterol in the nebulizer exhaled 0.06 more liters of air
• Participants who took the placebo exhaled 0.002 more liters of air
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. Researchers keep track
of all medical problems that participants had have during the study. These medical problems are called
“adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems during the study?
A similar number of participants in each treatment group had medical problems. A total of 4.5% of
participants, or 6 of 132 participants, stopped study treatment because of medical problems. The table
below shows how many participants in the study had medical problems.
