Which vaccine increased antibodies to each flu strain the most?
The researchers wanted to know which vaccine increased antibodies to each flu strain
the most. They did this by taking blood samples from each participant before they got
MEDI3250, 28 days after they got MEDI3250, and 56 days after they got MEDI3250.
In this study, participants’ antibodies were considered to be increased if there were at
least 4 times more antibodies in their blood after getting MEDI3250.
A/H1N1 strain
The main purpose of the study was to look at antibody responses to theA /H1N1 strain.
More participants who got Vaccine C had increased antibodies to the A/H1N1 strain
compared with participants who got Vaccine A or Vaccine B.
At 28 days after getting MEDI3250:
• 10.0% of participants who got Vaccine A had increased antibodies
• 5.4% of participants who got Vaccine B had increased antibodies
• 23.4% of participants who got Vaccine C had increased antibodies
At 56 days after getting MEDI3250:
• 23.7% of participants who got Vaccine A had increased antibodies
• 12.5% of participants who got Vaccine B had increased antibodies
• 45.2% of participants who got Vaccine C had increased antibodies
