Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, also called COPD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to
take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works. In this
study, the researchers wanted to find out if GFF changes how blood flows through the
heart in participants with COPD. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
COPD is a long-term condition that causes the airways to narrow. This can make it
difficult to breathe. COPD can also reduce the amount of blood that moves through the
heart. There are treatments for COPD to help people breathe more easily, but these
treatments do not work well for everyone with moderate to very severe COPD.
GFF is used to treat COPD. It works by relaxing muscles in the airways to allow more
air into the lungs. This makes it easier to breathe. Researchers think that GFF might
also increase blood flow through the heart.
GFF is taken through an inhaler that brings a specific amount of GFF to the lungs. The
inhaler is known as a metered dose inhaler, also called MDI.
The researchers in this study wanted to find out if GFF affected how blood flows
through the heart in participants with moderate or severe COPD.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did blood flow through the heart differently after the participants took GFF?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and
women with moderate or severe COPD. The participants in this study smoked at
least 10 pack-years, which means they had smoked an average of at least 1 pack
of cigarettes a day for 10 years.
