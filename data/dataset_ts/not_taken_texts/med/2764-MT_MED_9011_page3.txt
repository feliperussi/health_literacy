Clinical Trial RESULTS
Part 3 had 16 participants who stayed in the clinical research unit for 13 days. Each participant took one
6 mg dose of RDEA3170 on Days 1 and 8. On Day 1, half of the participants were assigned to take the 6 mg
dose of RDEA3170 after fasting overnight and the other half of the participants were assigned to take the
6 mg dose of RDEA3170 after a high-fat, high-calorie meal. On Day 8, they switched dosing regimen.
The Follow-Up Visit
All 40 participants came back to the clinical research unit about 7 days after the last dose of RDEA3170 for a
follow-up visit. Study doctors did a physical examination, checked participantsâ€™ blood pressure, heart rate, and
body temperature, took blood and urine samples, and answered questions about any medical problems and
other drugs the participants were taking. The chart below shows the 3 parts of the study.
