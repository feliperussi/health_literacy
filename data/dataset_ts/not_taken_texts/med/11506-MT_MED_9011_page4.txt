What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if BGF MDIs with different
propellants affected how much budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol
fumarate got into the blood of healthy participants.
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did BGF MDIs with different propellants affect how much of the study drugs
got into the participantsâ€™ blood?
X Did the participants notice any differences in taste when taking the study
drugs?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done so that researchers can learn the best and most environmentally friendly way
for people who have COPD to take budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol
fumarate.
