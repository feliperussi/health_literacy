When the participants took study treatment, how long was it before
their cancer got worse?
To answer this question, a group of experts that were not a part of this study’s
research team looked at pictures of the participants’ tumors using MRI or CT scans
taken during the study. They measured the growth of the tumors using a set of
rules called Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, also known as “RECIST”.
Then, the study researchers calculated the amount of time that the participants
lived with their cancer without their tumors growing. This is called “progression-
free survival”.
The researchers also wanted to know if certain genetic mutations affected how the
treatments worked. So, they looked at the results from participants with or without
certain genetic mutations. These mutations were in a gene called “BRCA” and in a
group of genes called “HRR”.
During this study, a different group of experts recommended that the participants
stop taking the combination of olaparib and adavosertib. This was due to a
higher number of medical problems in that group than in the other 2 groups,
and because the doctors did not think the study treatment was helping the
participants. So, this section does not include the results for the olaparib and
adavosertib group.
The researchers calculated the results as a median. This “median” is the time
beyond which half of the participants had progression-free survival. Overall, the
researchers found that the median for the time these participants lived before their
cancer got worse was:
Olaparib on its own Olaparib and ceralasertib
Participants with a BRCA mutation 7.3 months 7.4 months
(for 43 participants) (for 40 participants)
Participants who did not have a BRCA 1.9 months 3.9 months
mutation but had an HRR mutation (for 20 participants) (for 20 participants)
Participants who did not have an HRR 1.9 months 3.6 months
mutation (for 51 participants) (for 52 participants)
