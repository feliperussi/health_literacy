Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a “single-blind” study. This means the researchers knew what the participants were
taking, but the participants did not.
In this study, participants took either AZD0284 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does
not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they
see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This
helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the study doctors did a physical examination to make sure you could
join the study. They checked your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. They
took blood and urine samples and checked your heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
known as an ECG. The study doctors also asked about your medical history, how you were
feeling, and what medicines you were taking.
This study had 3 parts: Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2. All participants took either AZD0284 or a
placebo by mouth in liquid form.
Part 1a
Participants in Part 1a were in the study for up to 6 weeks. They visited their study site 4 times.
Participants in Part 1a took 1 of 7 doses of AZD0284 or a placebo without food. The amount of
AZD0284 in each dose was different. The first dose had the lowest amount of AZD0284 and the
seventh dose had the highest amount.
About 1 week after their treatment, participants had a follow-up examination.
Part 1b
Participants in Part 1b were in the study for up to 6 weeks. They visited their study site 6 times.
Participants in Part 1b took 1 dose of AZD0284 or a placebo with food.
About 1 week after their treatment, participants had a follow-up examination.
