Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease, a type
of heart disease. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took 1 of 2 different doses of AZD5718 or a
placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in the study were:
> Did AZD5718 affect the levels of leukotriene E4 in the
participants’ urine?
Yes. Overall, AZD5718 reduced the levels of leukotriene E4 in the
participants’ urine. Leukotriene E4 is a molecule from the body’s immune
system that can cause inflammation and increase the risk of coronary artery
disease.
> What medical problems did the participants have during this
study?
There were 9.4% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The
most common medical problem was a headache.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
