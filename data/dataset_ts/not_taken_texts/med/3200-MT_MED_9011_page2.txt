Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did omega-3 carboxylic acids act in the blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if omega-3 carboxylic acids improve the health of people with
high levels of triglycerides.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy Chinese men and women living in China.
Everyone in the study was 23 to 41 years old when they joined.
What kind of study was this?
This was an “open-label” study. This means the researchers and the participant knew
what the participant was taking. All of the participants took omega-3 carboxylic acids by
mouth. Each dose was 4 grams.
First, the participants took 1 dose of omega-3 carboxylic acids. They waited 72 hours
before taking the next dose, so that all of the study drug could leave their body. Then,
they took 1 dose of omega-3 carboxylic acids every day for 14 days.
What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the doctors checked the participants’ health to make sure
they could join the study. They did a test called an electrocardiogram to check the
participants’ heart health. An electrocardiogram is also called an ECG. Participants
were admitted to the study site 2 days before the first dose of the study drug was taken.
During treatment, the participants stayed at the study site for 19 days and took
omega-3 carboxylic acids on Day 1 and Days 4 to 17. Then, the participants stayed at
the study site for 1 more day but did not take the study drug.
Throughout the study, the doctors:
• checked the participants’ overall health
• asked the participants how they were feeling
• took blood and urine samples on certain days
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study. The results each participant had
might be different and are not in this summary.
