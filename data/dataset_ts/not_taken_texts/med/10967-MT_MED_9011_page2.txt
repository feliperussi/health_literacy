Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies
to find out how safe it is and how it works. The researchers in this study were
looking for a better way to treat patients who have heart failure.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as well as it
should. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and make the heart change
shape. It can also cause fluid to build up in the arms and legs.
There are treatments for heart failure, but these may cause other medical problems
in some patients. The study drug, AZD9977, was designed to work in a different
way than current treatments.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how different forms and doses of
AZD9977 act in the body, and if food affected this. They also wanted to learn if
AZD9977 causes any medical problems.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How did the different forms of AZD9977 act in the blood?
• How did AZD9977 act in the blood when taken with and without food?
• How did the different doses of AZD9977 act in the blood?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done that help find out if AZD9977 improves the health of people who have heart
failure.
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in the study
were 20 to 46 years old when they joined.
