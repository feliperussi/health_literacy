Clinical Study Results
Overall, 72 participants left the study before it was finished. Researchers could only measure
the change in blood sugar for participants who were in the study for at least 52 weeks. This
was in 202 participants who took dapagliflozin, 257 participants who took dapagliflozin and
saxagliptin, and 222 participants who took glimepiride.
After 52 weeks of treatment, researchers found:
• Participants who took dapagliflozin had their blood sugar levels decrease by an
average of 0.99%.
• Participants who took dapagliflozin and saxagliptin had their blood sugar levels decrease
by an average of 1.29%.
• Participants who took glimepiride had their blood sugar levels decrease by an average
of 1.16%.
The figure below shows these results.

Did the different drugs affect participants in other ways?
Researchers wanted to learn if the study drugs affected participants in other ways.
One test they used was measuring the body mass index, also known as BMI, of
participants. BMI helps doctors understand how much body fat participants have, based
on their height and weight. A higher BMI means that a person has a higher percentage of
body fat than a person with a lower BMI. The results below include the change in the BMI
of participants, as well as other changes.
