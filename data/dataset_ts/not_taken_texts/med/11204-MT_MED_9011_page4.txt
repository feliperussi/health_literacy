After the washout period, the participants visited their study site again and stayed for
about 1 week. Part 2 happened during the first half of the week, and Part 3 happened
during the second half of the week.
During Part 2, the participants took itraconazole once a day for 3 days.
During Part 3, the participants took savolitinib and itraconazole on the first day. Then, they
took only itraconazole on the second day of treatment.
About 2 weeks after their last treatment, the participants visited their study site
1 more time. At this visit, the study doctors again checked the participants’ health and
asked them how they were feeling.
