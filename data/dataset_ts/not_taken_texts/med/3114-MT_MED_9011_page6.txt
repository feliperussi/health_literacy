Clinical Study Results
Did SZC decrease the amount of potassium in the participants’ blood?
The researchers found that the participants in both treatment groups had less
potassium in their blood after taking treatment. But, the difference between
treatment groups was too small for researchers to know if SZC decreased the
amount of blood potassium compared to the placebo.
To answer this question, the doctors measured the participants’ blood potassium
4 hours after they took SZC or the placebo. Blood potassium is measured as
millimoles of potassium per liter of blood, also called mmol/L. The researchers then
calculated the average change in blood potassium from the time the participants
took their treatment to 4 hours later.
The researchers found that 4 hours after taking treatment, the participants had an
average of:
• 0.41 mmol/L less potassium in their blood after taking SZC
• 0.27 mmol/L less potassium in their blood after taking the placebo
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment is the cause of an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
Only 62 participants took at least 1 dose of SZC or placebo, so the section below
only includes the results from these participants.
