What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how savolitinib passes through the
blood, breaks down, and leaves the body of healthy participants.
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How much savolitinib got into the participants’ blood?
X How much savolitinib left the participants’ bodies in their urine and feces?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be
done to find out if savolitinib helps improve the health of people with cancer.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got both “normal” savolitinib and a
“radio-labeled” form of savolitinib. The radio-labeled savolitinib had a low
amount of radioactivity in it. This made it easier for the researchers to look
at savolitinib in the participants’ bodies.
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting.
The participants got 3 different doses of savolitinib:
X For Dose 1, they took normal savolitinib as tablets by mouth.
X For Dose 2, they got radio-labeled savolitinib through a needle into a vein,
also called an “IV infusion”. Dose 2 was given to the participants 1 hour and
45 minutes after they got Dose 1.
X For Dose 3, they got radio-labeled savolitinib as a liquid by mouth. The
participants got Dose 3 at least 2 weeks after they got Dose 2.
Dose 1 and Dose 3 of savolitinib were measured in milligrams, also known as
“mg”.
Dose 2 of savolitinib was measured in micrograms, also known as “μg”.
