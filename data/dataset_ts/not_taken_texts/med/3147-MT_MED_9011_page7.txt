What medical problems happened during
this study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an
adverse reaction.
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities. None of the participants had any
serious adverse reactions, or adverse reactions that resulted in death.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about the safety of AZD8601 in
participants with coronary artery disease who have coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one
study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD8601 are planned.
