Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have relapsed or
refractory lymphoma. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers
do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of
cells. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphocytes, which are white
blood cells. Lymphocytes help the body fight infection and disease and are stored
in an area of the immune system called the lymph nodes. Lymphoma starts in the
lymphocytes and can grow within the lymph nodes. “Relapsed” means that the
cancer was treated and seemed to be gone, but then later returned. “Refractory”
means that treatment did not affect the cancer at all.
There are treatments for lymphoma. But, these treatments may not stop the cancer
from growing or spreading and may not stop the cancer from returning. These
treatments may also cause medical problems.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of a current cancer
treatment called durvalumab when given with the study drugs tremelimumab or
AZD9150.
To do this, the researchers kept track of the “dose limiting toxicities” that the
participants had during the study. A dose limiting toxicity is a medical problem that
is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant’s dose of
study treatment. A dose limiting toxicity is also called DLT.
The researchers also wanted to find the “maximum tolerated dose” of the study
drugs. The maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose of a drug that does not
cause a DLT. The maximum tolerated dose is also called MTD.
