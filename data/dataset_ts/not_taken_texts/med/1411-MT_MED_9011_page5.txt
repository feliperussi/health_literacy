Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the study results.
Did the participants have any DLTs during the study?
No. None of the participants in either part of the study had a medical problem
severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing their dose.
What were the MTDs of the study drugs?
To answer this question, the researchers kept track of the medical problems the
participants had during the study to determine if any participants had a DLT. None
of the participants who got the highest doses of the study drugs had a DLT. So, the
researchers could not determine the MTD for any of the study drugs.
The highest doses of the study drugs were:
• 20 mg/kg of durvalumab given with 1 mg/kg of tremelimumab
• 20 mg/kg of durvalumab given with 3 mg/kg of AZD9150
What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and
measurements that were done before and during the study.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the results of
these tests and measurements during the study. But, in both parts of the study,
there were too few participants for the researchers to determine if these changes
were significant.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
