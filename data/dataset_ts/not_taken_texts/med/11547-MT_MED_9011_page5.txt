What was the purpose of this trial?
This was a “Phase 4” trial. Researchers already did trials that showed roxadustat
worked for the people with anemia from CKD who were in those trials. In this
trial, the researchers wanted to find out more about how roxadustat works
compared with rHuEPO.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were:
X Did roxadustat affect how much iron got into the participants’ blood
compared with rHuEPO?
X What medical problems did the doctors report as possibly related to the
trial treatment?
