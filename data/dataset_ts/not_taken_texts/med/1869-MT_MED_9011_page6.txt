Time it took for AZD4831 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Researchers measured the median time in hours that it took for AZD4831 to reach its highest amount in
the blood. The median is the amount of time halfway between the shortest time and the longest time it
took for AZD4831 to reach the highest amount in the blood. The figures below show this time for Part A
and Part B of the study.

What medical problems did participants have during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. Researchers keep track
of all medical problems that participants have during the study. These medical problems are called
“adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants had medical problems in the study?
In Part A, a similar percentage of participants taking AZD4831 and the placebo had medical problems.
In Part B, no participants had medical problems. The table below shows how many participants in
Part A of the study had medical problems. No participants stopped taking the study drug because
of medical problems.
