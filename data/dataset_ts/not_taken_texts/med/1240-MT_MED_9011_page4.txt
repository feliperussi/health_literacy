Clinical Study Results
What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each
participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions
the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this
summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on these

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk
to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
How did benralizumab affect the participants’ breathing?
Both the participants who got benralizumab and the participants who got the placebo had
their breathing improve. The participants who got benralizumab had greater improvement
in their breathing, but the difference between the treatments was too small for the
researchers to know if benralizumab improved breathing more than the placebo.
To answer this question, the researchers measured how much air the participants could
breathe out in 1 second. They measured the amount of air in liters, also called L. The
researchers compared the amount of air the participants could breathe out when they
joined the study to the amount of air they could breathe out after they got benralizumab or
the placebo.
At the end of the study, the researchers found that the average change in the amount of
air the participants could breathe out was:
• 0.218 L more for participants who got benralizumab
• 0.161 L more for participants who got the placebo
