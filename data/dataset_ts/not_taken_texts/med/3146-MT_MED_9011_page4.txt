Clinical Study Results
The participants who got MEDI0382 started out getting a low dose. Once the researchers
carefully studied the results for the low dose, they slowly increased the MEDI0382 dose. The
participants who got MEDI0382 received these doses:
• 100 μg of MEDI0382 each day for 1 week
• 200 μg of MEDI0382 each day for 1 week
• 300 μg of MEDI0382 each day for 2 weeks
After the participants got their last treatment, they visited their study site 2 times over
the course of about 1 month. At these visits, the study doctors checked the participants’ overall
health and blood sugar levels and asked them how they were feeling.
