What happened during this trial?
The participants have been in the trial for up to nearly 7 years. But, the entire
trial may take over 11 years to finish.
The trial started in January 2015 and the part of the trial that this summary is
based on ended in August 2021.
Before the participants received treatment, they visited their trial site once.
This part of the trial lasted for up to 1 month. At this visit, the trial doctors asked
the participants if they wanted to join the trial and made sure the participants
could join. They also:
X did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any
medical problems they were having
X took blood and urine samples
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
called an “ECG”
X took images of the participants’ cancer using a CT scan
X did a type of surgery called a “biopsy” to take small samples of the
participants’ bone marrow and lymph nodes
X asked participants questionnaires to learn how their cancer was affecting
their daily life and wellbeing
The trial doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the
trial.
While the participants received treatment, they visited their trial site many
times. The number of visits was different for each treatment group, but was at
least once a month for the first year. Then visits changed to every 3 months until
the end of the second year. For participants on the trial longer than 2 years, they
visited the trial site every 6 months. Participants stayed in the trial until their
cancer got worse, or they decided to leave the trial. The participants were able
to stay in the trial for as long as the doctors felt the trial treatment was helping
them. For some participants, this was longer than 3 years. The information
presented here is from the start of the trial until its closure in August 2021.
