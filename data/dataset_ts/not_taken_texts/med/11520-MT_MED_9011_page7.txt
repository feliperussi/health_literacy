For Group 1 and Group 3, this study was stopped because some of the drugs
were not effective in treating the participants’ cancer. Studies investigating these
drugs were not continued after the study.
For Group 2 and Group 4, this study was stopped early due to the number of
adverse events the participants were having. Studies investigating these drugs
were not continued after the study.
What medical problems happened during
this study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study treatments are called “adverse
reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by
the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment
causes an adverse reaction.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about the safety of 4 combination
treatments in adults with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one
study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies for any of these 4 combination treatments are not
planned.
