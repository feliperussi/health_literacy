What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 34 weeks. But, the entire study took
15 months to finish. The study started in May 2017 and ended in August 2018. The study
included 60 participants in the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
