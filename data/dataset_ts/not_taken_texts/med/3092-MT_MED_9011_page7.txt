What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this trial got 1 of the following treatments:
X durvalumab alone
X durvalumab and a higher dose of tremelimumab
X durvalumab and a lower dose of tremelimumab
X standard treatment for HCC
“Standard treatment” means the treatment that the medical community thinks is
an appropriate and widely used drug for the condition. For people with advanced
HCC, the standard treatment is sorafenib tablets twice a day.
In this summary, “trial treatment” means anything the participants
got as a part of the trial. This includes tremelimumab, durvalumab,
and the standard treatment. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are
the treatments that the researchers wanted to learn more about.
This was an “open-label” trial. This means the participants, researchers, trial
doctors, and other trial staff knew what each participant was getting.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do
this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
