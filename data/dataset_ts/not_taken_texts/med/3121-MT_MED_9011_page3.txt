What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did dapagliflozin work at least as well as acarbose to lower the levels of
HbA1c?
X What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if dapagliflozin helps improve the health of people with T2D.
What treatments did the participants
take?
In this study, the participants took either dapagliflozin or acarbose as capsules
by mouth. The doses were measured in milligrams, also known as “mg”.
It was planned for the participants to take 1 of the following treatments:
X 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once a day
X 50 mg or 100 mg of acarbose, 1 to 3 times a day
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers
do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as
possible.
