Clinical Trial RESULTS
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A lot of research is needed to know if a drug causes a medical problem. So when researchers study new drugs,
they keep track of all the medical problems that participants have during the study. These problems are called
“adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by RDEA3170..
Six (15%) out of 40 participants had at least 1 adverse event during the study:
• Two (13%) out of 16 participants in Part 1 had adverse events during the study.
• Two (25%) out of 8 participants in Part 2 had adverse events during the study.
• Two (13%) out of 16 participants in Part 3 had adverse events during the study.
What serious adverse events did participants have?
An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, when a participant
dies, or when a participant needs hospital care.
During this study, no participants had serious adverse events and no participants died.
What were the most common adverse events?
The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened during this study.

It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which study drugs work
best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with RDEA3170 are not currently planned.
