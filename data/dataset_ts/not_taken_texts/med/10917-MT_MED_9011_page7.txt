Clinical Study Results
What medical problems happened during the study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study
doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An
adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting
problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the
study treatment. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes
an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn about the safety of MEDI9447 in people who
have advanced cancer.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with MEDI9447 are planned.
