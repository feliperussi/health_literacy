Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took any study treatment, the doctors checked their
overall health to make sure that they could join the study. The doctors:
• took blood and urine samples
• took pictures of the participants’ tumors using CT, MRI scans, or both
• took samples of the participants’ tumors to test for changes in the MET gene
While the participants were taking study treatment, they visited their study
site a total of 5 times during the first 2 treatment cycles. After this, the participants
visited the study site 1 time at the start of each new treatment cycle. At these visits,
the doctors took blood samples and checked the participants’ health.
During the study, the doctors:
• took pictures of the participants’ tumors using CT and/or MRI scans every
6 weeks
• gave the participants surveys about their quality of life every 2 or 4 weeks
About 7 days after the last dose, the participants visited the study site. At this
visit, the doctors:
• checked the participants’ health
• took blood and urine samples
• took pictures of the participants’ tumors using CT, MRI scans, or both
Some participants could keep taking study treatment after the last planned dose, if
the study doctor agreed it was helping them.
About 30 days after the last dose, the doctors checked the participants’ health.
This could be done over the phone or at a visit to the study site.
