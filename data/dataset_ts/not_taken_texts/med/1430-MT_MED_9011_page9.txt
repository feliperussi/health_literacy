How has this study helped patients and
researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how durvalumab and
tremelimumab worked in participants with ES-SCLC who had received
chemotherapy that was no longer helping their cancer.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with these study drugs for treatment of this type of
ES-SCLC are not planned.
