Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy Chinese men and women. The
participants in this study were 18 to 43 years old when they joined.
The study included 48 participants in China.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat some conditions caused by
inflammation. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do
clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
The study drug, tezepelumab, was designed to help reduce inflammation.
Researchers are currently doing studies to find out if tezepelumab helps people
with any condition from a group of 5 conditions caused by inflammation, including
severe asthma.
Even though there have been several studies of tezepelumab worldwide, there
have been no studies specifically looking at how it works in Chinese participants.
The purpose of this study was to find out more about how tezepelumab passes
through, breaks down and leaves the body in healthy Chinese participants.
