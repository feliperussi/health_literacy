What happened during this study?
The study started in December 2017 and ended in May 2020. Additional
treatment groups that were planned to be enrolled in the study were no longer
enrolled because the sponsor decided to stop clinical studies for MEDI7219.
This decision was not related to concerns over safety.
The participants in Part B were in the study for about 3 months. The
participants in Part C were in the study for about 2 months.

1 time over a period of 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors made sure that
the participants could join the study. They also:
X did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medical histories,
their medications, and any medical problems they were having
X checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram,
also called an ECG
X took blood and urine samples
X did breath tests
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.

of each stay. There was at least 1 week between stays. During this break where

While the participants got study treatment in Part C, they stayed at the
study site for 4 days. The participants got the study treatment on the second
