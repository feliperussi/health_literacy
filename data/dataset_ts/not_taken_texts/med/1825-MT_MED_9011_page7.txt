The measurements that were too low were:
X How quickly the kidneys removed creatinine from the blood
X A blood protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen
X Types of white blood cells called leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes
X Blood cells called platelets that help form blood clots
X A blood protein called albumin
X Blood potassium and sodium
The researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of the
other tests and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these to be
significant.
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if
they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
