Clinical Study Results
The researchers measured the change in the highest amount of uric acid in the
participants’ urine. This helps the researchers to know how much uric acid was in the
participants’ blood. They measured this before treatment and after treatment for 7 days.
The researchers then compared the change in the amount of uric acid for each treatment.
The amount of uric acid was measured in milligrams, also called mg.
After 7 days of treatment the participants had:
• 12.9 mg less uric acid in their urine while taking RDEA3170, febuxostat, and
dapagliflozin
• 13.2 mg less uric acid in their urine while taking RDEA3170, febuxostat, and
a placebo
The chart below shows these results.
