Clinical trial results
On both days, the average amount of AZD8871 in the blood increased
as the dose increased.
The highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood
Researchers measured the highest amount of AZD8871 in participants’
blood for the 3 study drug doses of 300 μg, 600 μg, and 900 μg on both
Day 1 and Day 16.
Overall, researchers found the following:
• On Day 1, the higher doses of AZD8871 led to participants having
the highest amounts of the study drug in their blood.
• On Day 16, the higher doses of AZD8871 led to participants having
the highest amounts of the study drug in their blood. The highest
amount of the study drug in the blood for the doses of AZD8871
didn’t increase on Day 16 compared to Day 1.
On both Day 1 and Day 16, the highest amount of AZD8871 in the blood
generally increased as the dose increased.
How long it took for AZD8871 to reach its highest amount in the blood
Researchers measured how long it took for AZD8871 to reach its highest
amount in the blood for the 3 study drug doses of 300 μg, 600 μg, and
900 μg on both Day 1 and Day 16.
Overall, researchers found the following:
• On Day 1, it took about 1.5 hours for all 3 doses of AZD8871
to reach their highest amount in participants’ blood.
• On Day 16, it also took about 1.5 hours for all 3 doses of AZD8871
to reach their highest amount in participants’ blood.
How long it took for AZD8871 to reach steady levels in the blood
Researchers measured how long it took for AZD8871 to reach steady levels
in the blood. By Day 12, the amount of AZD8871 in the blood remained at
a steady level.
