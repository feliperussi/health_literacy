Overall, the differences between the participants who took SZC and those who took
the placebo in all 4 categories were small and not significant. So, this study did not
show that SZC affected how many participants could take RAAS inhibitors.
The participants who could take an MRA at the target dose were the group who
received the greatest protection against heart failure. The researchers found that
more participants who took SZC could take an MRA at the target dose compared
with those who took the placebo. But, this difference was not significant.
What medical problems happened during the
study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during
the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug,
SZC, or to the placebo. These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”.
An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all
of the available data for the study drug.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information
about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this
study.
There was 1 participant who did not take any treatment. So, the information
below is for the 181 participants who took at least 1 dose of treatment.
