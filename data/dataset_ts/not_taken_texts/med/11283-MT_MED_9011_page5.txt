What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
The study doctors kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.
Later in this document, there will be a summary of the adverse events that the
study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. This section
is a summary of all the adverse events, whether they might be related to the
study treatment or not. An adverse event is considered “serious” when it is life-
threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot
of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
How many participants had adverse events?
X 37.5% of the participants who took AZD4831 had adverse events. This was
9 out of 24 participants.
X 12.5% of the participants who took the placebo had an adverse event. This
was 1 out of 8 participants.
How many participants had serious adverse events?
X None of the participants had a serious adverse event during the study.
How many participants stopped taking study treatment due to adverse events?
X 20.8% of the participants who took AZD4831 stopped taking study
treatment due to adverse events. This was 5 out of 24 participants.
X None of the 8 participants who took the placebo stopped taking it due to
adverse events.
Overall, the number of participants who had adverse events was higher in the
groups who took the higher doses of AZD4831. The only adverse events that
happened in more than 1 participant were:
X skin rash
X itchy, red, and dry skin
X fever
