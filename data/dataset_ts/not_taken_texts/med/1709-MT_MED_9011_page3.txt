Clinical Trial Results
What kind of study was this?
Your study was a “single-blind” study. This means that the study staff
knew which drug the participants took, but the participants did not.
The study was also a “crossover” study. In a crossover study, all
participants get the same treatments and tests, but the treatments are
given in a random order.
Your study included 32 participants who were 23 to 70 years old and had
type 1 diabetes. Out of the original 32 participants, all 32 participants got
the pramlintide and insulin treatment. Only 28 of the 32 participants got
the placebo and insulin treatment. This is because some participants left
the study before it was completed.
What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to about 15 weeks.
To see if you could join the study, the study doctors did a physical
examination by checking your height, weight, and temperature. They
also took blood and urine samples and checked your heart health using
an electrocardiogram, or ECG. The study doctors asked about your
medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were
taking. These tests were repeated at every visit throughout the study.
If you are female, you had a blood test to make sure you were not
pregnant.
During the study, participants visited their study site 6 times.
