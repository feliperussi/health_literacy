How has this study helped participants and
researchers?
These results helped researchers learn more about the safety of osimertinib when
taken with durvalumab compared to osimertinib alone in patients with lung cancer.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with osimertinib are planned. Further clinical studies with
durvalumab are also planned.
