Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs. These medical
problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious”
when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about
adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had a serious adverse reaction.
How many participants had adverse reactions?
There were 2.2% of the participants who had adverse reactions when taking the
placebo during the study. This was 1 out of 45 participants. This adverse reaction was a
rapid heartbeat that happened once during the study.
None of the participants who took AZD6094 had an adverse reaction.
None of the participants left the study or stopped taking AZD6094 because of adverse
reactions
How has this study helped participants and
researchers?
These results helped the researchers determine the effects of the study drug AZD6094.
This will help them make decisions related to using AZD6094 in the care of patients
with cancerous solid tumors.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best
and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study. Other
studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD6094 are ongoing and planned.
