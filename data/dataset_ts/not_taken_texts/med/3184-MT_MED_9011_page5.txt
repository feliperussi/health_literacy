Clinical Study Results
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
There was 1 participant who did not finish the study. So, the results below only
include information from 40 participants who completed the study.
Did MEDI0382 change the levels of glucose in the blood?
Yes, the researchers found that MEDI0382 changed the participants’ blood glucose
levels.
To answer this question, the researchers looked at the participants ’blood glucose
levels before and after they took the study treatment. They measured the average
total amount of glucose in the blood 4 hours after the participants ate a meal.
The researchers compared the average total amounts of blood glucose for the
participants who took MEDI0382 and the participants who took the placebo.
They calculated the average percentage difference between before and after
treatment. The researchers found:
• the participants who took MEDI0382 had a 26.7% decrease in average total amounts
of blood glucose
• the participants who took the placebo had a 3.7% increase in average total amount s
of blood glucose
