Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this
summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this
information out helps protect their identities.
The medical problems that participants have during a study that the doctors think
might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse
reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems,
or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the
study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse
reaction. In this study, there were no serious adverse reactions.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study ended early and there were a small number of participants. So, the
researchers did not have enough information to make any conclusions about how
AZD0284 affected the participants.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study.
Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with AZD0284 are planned.
