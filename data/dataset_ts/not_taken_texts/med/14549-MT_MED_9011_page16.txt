How effective was AZD1222 after the first injection?
The researchers also wanted to know about the efficacy of AZD1222 after just
1 injection of the standard dose level. In all 4 trials, the researchers compared the
number of participants in each group who had symptoms and tested positive for
COVID-19 and used the mathematical model to calculate the efficacy. They did
this at different time periods after the participants’ first injections of the standard
dose level.
The table below shows the number of participants who had symptoms and tested
positive for COVID-19 at different time periods after their first injection. It also
shows the efficacy calculation for each period of time.
