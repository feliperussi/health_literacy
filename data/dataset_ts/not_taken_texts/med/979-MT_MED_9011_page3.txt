Clinical Study Results
During Part 1, all of the participants took a placebo. The researchers gave all
of the participants the same treatment during this part so that the study results for
Part 2 would be as accurate as possible.
Part 2 of this study was “double-blind”. This means none of the
participants, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each
participant took. Some studies are done this way because knowing what
treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the
study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants took
so they could create a report of the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each
participant took during Part 2. This helped make sure the groups were chosen
fairly. The researchers did this so that comparing the results of each treatment
was as accurate as possible.
During Part 2, the participants took either dapagliflozin or a placebo.
All of the treatments in this study were taken in tablet form by mouth.
What happened during this study?
Before this study started, the study doctors:
• did a physical examination to make sure the participants could join this study
• checked the blood sugar levels and kidney health of the participants to see
how damaged their kidneys were
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking
Part 1
Once the study doctors said that the participants could join this study, the
participants took a placebo once a day for 4 weeks. After the first 4 weeks, the
participants were put into 2 new treatment groups for Part 2.
