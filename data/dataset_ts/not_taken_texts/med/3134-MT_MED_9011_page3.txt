Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with severe asthma. The
participants in this study were 22 to 76 years old when they joined.
Before the start of the study, the participants:
> Had taken OCS during the last 6 months. They had to have been on a steady
dose of OCS for 1 month or more.
> Had 1 or more asthma attacks during the last 12 months.
> Had been taking a high dose of steroid inhaler plus another treatment to
control their asthma for 3 months or more.
The study included 150 participants in 7 countries: Argentina, Germany, South
Korea, Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe asthma. Before a drug can
be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if tezepelumab works in
participants with severe asthma who need OCS in addition to other treatments
to control their asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any
medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a lung disease that causes the airways to narrow and causes
inflammation in the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have
asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.
There are treatments that can help people who have asthma to manage their
symptoms. One example is oral corticosteroids, also known as “OCS”. Some
people who have severe asthma need several different treatments to help control
their asthma.
The study drug, tezepelumab, is being developed as a treatment for asthma to
help reduce inflammation in the lungs. In this study, the researchers wanted to find
out if tezepelumab could reduce the amount of OCS the participants needed to
control asthma symptoms.
