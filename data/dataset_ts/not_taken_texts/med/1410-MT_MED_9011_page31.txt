What medical problems happened during the
China cohort?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the
China cohort that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs.
These medical problems are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction
is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These
adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of
the available data for durvalumab and tremelimumab.
Although there were 3 groups in the China cohort, the adverse reactions the
participants had are presented together, as there were a small number of
participants in each group.
