How much abediterol got in the participants’ blood?
In the study, the researchers had planned to measure and compare how much
abediterol got in the participants’ blood when it was taken through 2 different
nebulizers, or the dry powder inhaler.
The study sponsor made the decision to end the study early. Because there was
a small number of participants when the study was ended, there was not enough
information for the researchers to answer this question.
