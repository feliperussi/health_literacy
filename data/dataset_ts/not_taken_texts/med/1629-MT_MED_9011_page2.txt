Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced NSCLC. Researchers
already did studies that showed that osimertinib worked for people with advanced
NSCLC. In this study the researchers wanted to find out more about the safety of
osimertinib and how well it worked after it had been approved in some countries to
be used as a treatment.
What treatments did the participants take?
All of the participants in this study took osimertinib.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How long did the participants live after taking osimertinib?
The researchers found that the participants lived for an average of 22.8 months
after taking osimertinib.
X What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 3.0% of participants who had medical problems that the study
doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most
common medical problem was having a longer time between heart beats.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
