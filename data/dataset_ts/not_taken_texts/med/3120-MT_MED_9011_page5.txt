How much caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam was in the participants’
blood when they were taken with adavosertib?
The researchers wanted to find out if the participants had more caffeine, omeprazole, and
midazolam in their blood when they took these with adavosertib.
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of caffeine, omeprazole,
and midazolam in the participants’ blood during Part A of the study. They measured:
• the average highest amount of caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam in the blood.
This was measured in nanograms per milliliter, also known as ng/mL.
• the average total amount of caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam in the blood. This
was measured in nanograms per milliliter per hour, also known as ng*h/mL.
The results of these measurements are shown on the next page.
