Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug adavosertib, also
called AZD1775. All of the participants helped researchers learn more about AZD1775 to help
people with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped
prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel
proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor
or staff at your study site.
