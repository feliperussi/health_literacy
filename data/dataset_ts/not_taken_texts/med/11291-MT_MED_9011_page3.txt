What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> Did the amount of verinurad that got into the blood affect how the heart
beats?
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other larger studies
can be done to find out if verinurad helps improve the health of people with CKD.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took each of the following treatments by
mouth:
> verinurad as a capsule and allopurinol as a tablet
> a placebo that looks like verinurad and a placebo that looks like allopurinol
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use
a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who
take the treatment are actually caused by the treatment.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, researchers,
study doctors, or other study staff knew the order that each participant took their
treatments.
There were 6 groups of participants, and each group took the treatments in
a different order. The doses of verinurad and allopurinol were measured in
milligrams, also known as mg.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order that each participant
would take their treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly.
Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate
as possible.
