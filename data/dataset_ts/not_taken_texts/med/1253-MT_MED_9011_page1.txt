Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug
anifrolumab, also called MEDI-546. All of the participants helped researchers learn
about using anifrolumab to help people with systemic lupus erythematosus, also called
lupus or SLE.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of
the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 15 months. But, the entire study took a little less
than 2 years to finish. The study started in February 2017 and ended in December 2018.
The study included 36 participants in Hungary, South Korea, Poland, and the United
States.
When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data collected and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
