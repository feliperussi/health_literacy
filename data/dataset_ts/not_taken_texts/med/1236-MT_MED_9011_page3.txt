Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• did a physical examination of the participants
• checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram,
also known as an ECG
• took blood and urine samples
• asked about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling,
and what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants took 5 benralizumab treatments through the
auto-injection device. All 5 treatments contained 30 milligrams, also known as
mg, of benralizumab.
The participants took benralizumab once every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The first
3 treatments were taken at the study site, and the last 2 treatments were taken
at home.
For the first treatment, the doctors gave the participants the benralizumab
injection at their study site. The doctors did this so that the participants could ask
any questions before they or their caregivers gave an injection.
For the last 4 treatments, either the participants or their caregivers could give
the participants the benralizumab injections. Two of these last 4 treatments were
taken at home.
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site twice for
follow-up visits over the course of 12 weeks. At those visits, the doctors
checked their overall health and asked how they were feeling.
