Clinical Trial Results
Why was the research needed?
The researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD. Before a drug can
be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it
works and how safe it is.
COPD is a lung disease that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways,
which can make it difficult to breathe.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD8871 works in participants
with COPD. They also wanted to find out if participants had any medical problems
during the study.
The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much air could participants exhale after taking different doses of AZD8871?
• Did the COPD symptoms of participants improve after taking AZD8871?
• How did AZD8871 act in the body?
• What medical problems did participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the participation of
men and women with COPD. The participants in this study were 49 to 79 years old.
What kind of study was this?
This was a “double-blind” study. This means that none of the participants,
doctors, or other staff knew which treatment each participant took. This was also
a “crossover” study. This means that all participants took each treatment but in a
different order.
In this study, all participants took AZD8871 and a placebo. A placebo looks like
a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help
make sure any of the effects they see in participants who take the drug are
actually caused by the drug.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which
participants took each treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen
fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as
accurate as possible.
