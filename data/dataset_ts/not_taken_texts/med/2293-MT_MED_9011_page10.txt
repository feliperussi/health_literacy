Increased levels of acid in the blood
People with type 1 diabetes can have episodes where they have increased levels
of acids in their blood from breaking down fats. This happens when the body’s
cells are not getting enough sugar, which is often caused by someone taking too
little insulin or missing doses of insulin. These acids are called ketones.
When patients have greatly increased levels of ketones in the blood, this is called
DKA.
In this study, the doctors kept track of how many participants had DKA and
how many times this happened. These episodes were counted whether or not
the doctors thought they might be related to the study drug. The main way
that episodes of DKA were looked at in this study was by a process called
“adjudication”.
Adjudication means that expert doctors who were not treating the participants
and who did not know whether the participants were getting the study drug or
placebo decided what type of event the participant had. They decided whether
the event was a definite DKA, possible DKA, or unlikely to be DKA. Only definite
events of DKA were thought to be true events of DKA in this study. To make
their decision, the doctors looked at many types of information. These included
the participants’ blood sugar and ketones, symptoms, laboratory results and the
report from the participant’s doctor.
