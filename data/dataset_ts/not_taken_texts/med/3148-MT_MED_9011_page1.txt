Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug AZD5718.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the
study results.
If you participated in this study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in February 2018 and ended in April 2018. The sponsor reviewed
the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is
a summary of that report. The study included 14 participants in England.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease, also called
CAD. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical
studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
One major cause of CAD is chronic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process
that helps fight disease and infection. But, for patients with CAD, chronic inflammation
can make the disease worse.
Researchers think AZD5718 can help patients with CAD by reducing chronic inflammation.
