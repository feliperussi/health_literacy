Clinical Trial RESULTS
Researchers also found the following:
• For doses from 5 to 800 mg, AZD9977 reached its highest amount in the blood anywhere
from 30 minutes to 1 hour after the dose.
• Compared to the 200 mg dose, the 800 mg dose left 4 times the amount of AZD9977
in the body and the 1200 mg dose left 6 times the amount of AZD9977 in the body.
How is AZD9977 absorbed in the body in participants who take it in capsule form compared
to liquid form?
Researchers studied the results from Part B to answer this question. They looked at how AZD9977
was absorbed in the body of participants who took the IntelliCap capsule form compared to a liquid
form. They found the following:
Capsule:
• AZD9977 reached its highest amount in the blood at an average of just over 4 hours
after the dose.
Liquid:
• AZD9977 reached its highest amount in the blood at an average of 45 minutes after
the dose.
• The amount of AZD9977 in the blood was 1.5 times higher when taken as a liquid
compared to the capsule form.
• The highest amount of AZD9977 in the blood over a certain measured time period
was 4.9 times higher than in the capsule.
Together, these results show that the body absorbs more of AZD9977 in liquid form than
in capsule form.
WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PARTICIPANTS HAVE?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So, when new
drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have.
These medical problems are also called “adverse events”. They may or may not be caused by the
study drug.
How many participants had medical problems?
In Part A, 11 out of the 46 participants (23.9%) who took AZD9977 and 7 out of the 16 participants
(43.8%) who took placebo had at least 1 medical problem. No participants stopped taking the study
drug because of medical problems.
