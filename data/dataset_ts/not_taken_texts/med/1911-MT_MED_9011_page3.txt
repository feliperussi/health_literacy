Clinical Trial Results
During the study, there were 4 different treatment periods of 11 days each. During each treatment
period, participants stayed at the study site for 3 days. During this time, each participant took the
following treatments through inhalers, but in different orders:
• 2.5 µg, or micrograms, of abediterol
• 440 µg of AZD7594
• 2.5 µg of abediterol and 440 µg of AZD7594 together in 1 inhaler
• 2.5 µg of abediterol and 440 µg of AZD7594 in 2 separate inhalers
There was a “washout period” of about 21 days between each treatment. This means that when
participants take the next study treatment, all drugs have been processed and “washed out of their
bodies. During the washout period, you were not allowed to take certain drugs.
During the study, participants returned to the study site on Days 4, 5, 7, and 11 of each treatment
period. During these visits, researchers did blood and urine tests, physical examinations, and
other tests to check your overall health. Researchers checked your heart health using an ECG
and checked your lung health. Researchers also asked you how you were feeling and if you were
taking any other medicines.
The figure below shows how the study was done.
Open-label treatment
32 participants took 4 treatments in different orders:
• Abediterol alone
• AZD7594 alone
• Abediterol and AZD7594 together in 1 inhaler
• Abediterol and AZD7594 in 2 separate inhalers
• Washout period of about 21 days between treatments
• Return visits on Days 4, 5, 7, and 11
4 treatment periods of 11 days each
Participants had a final visit about 10 to 14 days after getting the last treatment. During this visit,
researchers did a physical examination, took blood and urine samples, and checked your heart
health using an ECG. Researchers also checked your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature
and asked you how you were feeling and what medicines you were taking.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during the
study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide
which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD7594
and abediterol are planned.
