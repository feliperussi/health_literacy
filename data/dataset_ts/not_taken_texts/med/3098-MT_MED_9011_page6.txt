Clinical Study Results
What new medical problems did the participants have
during the study?
This section is a summary of the new medical problems the participants had during the
study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment.
New medical problems that study doctors think might be related to study treatment
are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is
life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about the
adverse reactions or other new medical problems that happened during this study.
The researchers could only study the below results for 195 of the 196 participants. This
was because 1 participant in the SZC group did not receive study treatment.
