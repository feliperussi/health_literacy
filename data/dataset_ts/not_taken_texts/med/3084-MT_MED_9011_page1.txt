Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug MEDI0382.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about using MEDI0382 to help people who
have type 2 diabetes and are overweight or have obesity.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study with
the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped
prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel
proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in August 2017 and ended in June 2019. It included 834 participants in
Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Slovakia, and the
United States.
The participants were in the study for a little less than 2 years. But, the entire study took about
2 years to finish.
When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the data collected and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
