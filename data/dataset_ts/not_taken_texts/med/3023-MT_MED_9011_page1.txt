Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug AZD4785.
All of the participants helped researchers learn more about AZD4785 to help people with
advanced cancer.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results
of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization
called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the
participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with
the doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to 8 months. However, the entire study took
about 20 months to complete. The study started in May 2017 and ended in January 2019.
The researchers planned to include up to 50 participants in the study. But, the study ended
earlier than expected because the sponsor decided not to continue the research into this
drug. The study included 28 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of
the results. This is a summary of that report.
