Did the participants’ quality of life change after getting GP MDI?
Overall, the researchers could not conclude that GP MDI changed the
participants’ quality of life.
To answer this question, the doctors asked the participants to answer 3 different
questionnaires before and after they took study treatment. These questionnaires
were the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 and 7, also called ACQ-5 and ACQ-7,
and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, also called AQLQ.
The questionnaires asked how the participants felt about their asthma symptoms
and about their quality of life. The doctors gave the participants a score based on
their answers.
The researchers compared the participants’ scores before and after they took
study treatment. Overall, the differences between the GP MDI groups and the
placebo and Spiriva Respimat groups were too small for the researchers to know
if GP MDI changed the participants’ quality of life.
