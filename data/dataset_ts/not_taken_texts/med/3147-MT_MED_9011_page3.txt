Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who needed a coronary
artery bypass graft. The participants in this study were 53 to 79 years old when
they joined. The participants had coronary artery disease and the left side of
their hearts could not pump as much blood as normal.
All of the participants were having CABG surgery as part of their normal
treatment for their coronary artery disease. Their CABG surgeries were planned
in advance rather than done as emergency procedures.
The study included 11 participants in Finland and Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat coronary artery disease in people
who are having CABG surgery. Before a drug can be approved for people to get,
researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if AZD8601 works in a small
number of participants with coronary artery disease who are having CABG
surgery. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical
problems during the study.
In people with coronary artery disease, the blood vessels that carry blood to the
heart become narrowed or blocked. This stops the heart from working properly.
People with coronary artery disease may have chest pain and are at increased
risk of having a heart attack.
CABG surgery helps to restore blood supply to the heart. Surgeons attach a new
blood vessel to the coronary artery, which helps the blood avoid the blockage.
This new blood vessel is usually taken from the patient’s leg or arm.
AZD8601 was designed to increase the amount of a protein called “VEGF-A”.
VEGF-A helps new blood vessels to grow. AZD8601 was designed to be injected
into the heart during CABG surgery to help increase the blood supply to the heart.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about the safety of
AZD8601 in participants who were having CABG surgery.
