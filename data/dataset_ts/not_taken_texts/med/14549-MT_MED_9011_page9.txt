In each of the trials, the participants who received the control got the same
number of injections as those who received AZD1222. This was done so that the
participants could not tell whether they were receiving AZD1222 or the control.
About the low dose level
There was a discrepancy in the measurement of the vaccine in the initial doses in the
COV002 trial, and some doses in the COV005 trial, which resulted in some participants
receiving a half dose. The data was reviewed by the independent Data Safety Monitoring
Board and the UK regulator, both of whom approved the continuation with no concern
and the participants were informed. All other regulatory authorities where the University
of Oxford and AstraZeneca had ongoing interactions were also informed.
