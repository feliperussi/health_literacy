Clinical Study Results
Research Sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug Studied: AZD5634
Short Study Title: A study to learn if AZD5634 helps remove mucus from the
lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and is safe to take
Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study treatment AZD5634.
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent
non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
What is happening with the study now?
The study started in May 2017 and ended in April 2018. It included participants in the United
States.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the
results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a way to help people with cystic fibrosis breathe better. Before a
treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how
safe it is and how it works.
Cystic fibrosis affects the body’s ability to move salt and water in and out of cells. This makes
the lungs and pancreas give off a thick mucus. The mucus sticks to the lungs and airways, which
makes it hard to breathe.
Researchers think that AZD5634 helps remove mucus from the lungs by stopping the movement
of salt in the lungs. The researchers in this study wanted to find out if AZD5634 helped
participants breathe better by removing mucus from the lungs. The researchers also wanted to
find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• How much mucus did AZD5634 help remove from the lungs?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that
help find out if AZD5634 improves the health of people with cystic fibrosis.
In this study, the researchers asked for the help of people with cystic fibrosis.
