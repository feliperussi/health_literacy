Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have during
the study?
A medical problem that happens during a study is called an “adverse event”. An adverse
event that the study doctors think might be related to the study drug is called an “adverse
reaction”. This section is a summary of the adverse reactions the participants had during
the study. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes
lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research
is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse
reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
