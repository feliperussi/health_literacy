Clinical Study Results
Research sponsor: AstraZeneca AB
Drug studied: AZD5718
Short study title: A study to learn if AZD5718 is safe to take with
rosuvastatin for people with heart disease
Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the drug AZD5718. This drug is being
developed to treat people with coronary artery disease, also known as CAD. You helped
researchers learn how AZD5718 acts in the body when taken with rosuvastatin, which is an
approved drug for treating CAD. You also helped the researchers learn if AZD5718 causes
medical problems. The study started in November 2016 and ended in March 2017.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study
with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared
this summary of the study results. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your
important role in medical research.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the
doctor or staff at your study site.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat CAD. Before a drug can be approved for
patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if healthy participants had any medical
problems during the study. They also wanted to find out how AZD5718 works in the body.
This information is important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD5718
improves the health of people with CAD.
CAD is a disease that can cause damage to blood vessels in the heart. One major cause of
CAD is the build-up of cholesterol in the arteries near the heart. This build-up can lead to heart
failure and other serious medical problems.
Another major cause of CAD is chronic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process that
helps fight disease and infection. But, for patients with CAD, chronic inflammation can make
the disease worse.
The other drug in this study, rosuvastatin, is already approved to treat patients with CAD.
Rosuvastatin treats CAD by reducing cholesterol build-up in the arteries. The study drug,
AZD5718, may help patients with CAD by reducing chronic inflammation.
