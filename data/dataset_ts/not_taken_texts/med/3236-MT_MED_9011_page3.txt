What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X What signs and symptoms did the participants have?
X What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies
can be done to find out if MEDI6570 helps improve the health of people with
cardiovascular disease.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants received 1 of several different possible doses of
MEDI6570, or a placebo. These were given through a needle under the skin, also
known as an injection. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any
medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects
they see in the participants who receive the treatment are actually caused by the
treatment.
This was a “double-blind” study. This means none of the participants, study
doctors, or other study staff knew whether the participants were receiving
MEDI6570 or the placebo. Some studies are done this way because knowing what
treatment the participants are receiving can affect the results of the study.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant
received. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so
that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
