Clinical Study Results
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are
safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor
before making any treatment changes.
Some of the participants who started taking GFF or UV did not complete the study. These
participants still contributed information up until the point at which they stopped the study.
Did GFF affect the amount of air participants could breathe out at least as much
as UV did?
How much air the participants could breathe out in the morning before taking
treatment
The amount of air participants could breathe out in the morning before taking treatment was not
as large for participants taking GFF compared with those taking UV.
At the beginning of the study, researchers measured the amount of air participants breathed
out in 1 second in the morning before taking their first dose of the treatment. They repeated this
measurement in the morning of each study visit before the participant took the morning treatment
dose. Researchers then compared these measurements to the measurements before the first
dose of treatment. The amount of air breathed out was measured in milliliters, also called mL.
Over the 24 weeks of the study:
• The participants taking GFF breathed out an average of 82.4 mL more air in the morning than
they did at the start of the study.
• The participants taking UV breathed out an average of 169.6 mL more air in the morning than
they did at the start of the study.
