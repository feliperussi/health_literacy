Clinical trial results
What medical problems did participants have during the study?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical
problem, so researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants
had during the study. These medical problems are called “adverse events”.
They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
How many participants developed medical problems in the study?
During this study, 13 out of 24 participants (54.2%) developed medical
problems. No participants left the study because of medical problems.
