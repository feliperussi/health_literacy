During Part 1, 24 participants took 150 micrograms, or μg, of AZD7594 through an IV.
One participant withdrew before Part 2.
During Part 2, 23 participants took 400 μg of AZD7594 using the DPI 1 inhaler. Four
additional participants withdrew before Part 3.
During Part 3, researchers split the remaining 19 participants into 2 groups. Group 1
had 9 participants that took 400 μg of AZD7594 using the DPI 2 inhaler. Group 2 had
10 participants that took 400 μg of AZD7594 using a pMDI inhaler. Another group was
added to make sure the other Part 3 pMDI inhaler results were accurate This group had
6 participants who took 400 μg of AZD7594 using a pMDI inhaler only. One additional
participant withdrew before Part 4.
During Part 4, 18 remaining participants took 1200 μg of AZD7594 in liquid form through
