Clinical Study Results
The study doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants
had during the study. An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that
participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An adverse
event is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or
the participant needs hospital care.
Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of
research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about
the adverse events that happened during this study.
