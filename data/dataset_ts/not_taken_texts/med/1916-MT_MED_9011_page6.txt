Clinical Study Results
Did the participants’ safety results change during the study?
No. Overall, the researchers found that the participants’ safety results did not
change during the study.
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and
measurements that the doctors took throughout the study. The doctors:
• did physical examinations
• took blood and urine samples
• did ECGs
• studied the participants’ vital signs
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants’
results during the study. But, these changes were too small for the researchers to
consider them to be meaningful.
The doctors also kept track of the “adverse events” that the participants had during
the study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a
study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they
do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An adverse
event is considered “serious” when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or
the participant needs hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by
the treatments in the study.

the adverse events that happened during this study.
