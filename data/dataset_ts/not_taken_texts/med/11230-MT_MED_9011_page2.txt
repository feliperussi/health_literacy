Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants
in this study were 22 to 59 years old when they joined.
The study included 36 participants, all in the United States.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat obesity. Before a drug can be
approved for people to get it, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe
it is and how it works.
The study drug, cotadutide, is being developed to treat people who have
obesity and type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing appetite and slowing
digestion, which helps people feel full for longer. This may help people who
have obesity to lose weight. Researchers also think that cotadutide can reduce
blood sugar levels, which would help people who have type 2 diabetes.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about how cotadutide
acted in the blood of healthy participants. They wanted to learn how much
cotadutide got into the blood when injected through a needle into different
parts of the body.
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
> How much cotadutide got into the participantsâ€™ blood when injected into
different parts of the body?
> What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can
be done to find out if cotadutide helps improve the health of people who have
obesity and type 2 diabetes.
