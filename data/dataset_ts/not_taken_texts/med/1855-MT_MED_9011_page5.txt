Clinical Trial RESULTS
How did AZD9977 alone affect the passing of sodium and potassium in urine
and the amount of urine produced compared to AZD9977 and eplerenone
or to a placebo?
Sodium:
The amount of sodium passed out of the body in urine was:
• Sometimes higher for AZD9977 and eplerenone compared to eplerenone
and a placebo.
• Sometimes higher for AZD9977 alone compared to a placebo.
Potassium:
The amount of potassium passed out of the body in urine was:
• Similar for AZD9977 alone compared to eplerenone and a placebo.
• Lower for AZD9977 alone compared to a placebo.
• Lower for AZD9977 and eplerenone compared to eplerenone and a placebo.
Amount of Urine:
At certain times during the study, the amount of urine passed out of the body in urine
was more for:
• AZD9977 and eplerenone compared to eplerenone and a placebo.
• AZD9977 alone compared to a placebo.
How did AZD9977 and eplerenone act in the body?
The amounts of fludrocortisone, AZD9977, and eplerenone in the body were measured.
The drugs did not seem to have an effect on each other or affect their ability to work in
the body.
