What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people during a study. Study
doctors record these events. A summary of adverse events can be found in the
scientific results summary (a link to the summary for this study is provided at the end
of this document).
In this summary, side effects (adverse reactions) refer to those events that the study
doctor thinks may have been caused by the DEXA scans. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent for this study or other
documents related to the DEXA scans.
No side effects due to the DEXA scans were reported during the study.
Side effects that the study doctor thought may have been caused by the study
medicines in the parent studies (2016361 and 2016372) are reported in the plain
language summaries for the parent studies posted on the ViiV Study Register (links
below).
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The main results showed that patients with HIV-1 infection taking DTG and RPV had
improved bone mineral density compared with their values at study start. The bone
mineral density in patients taking their CAR containing tenofovir remained similar to
their values at study start. No side effects were reported in this study.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of DTG and RPV in patients with HIV-1 infection have been conducted.
One study is planned.
