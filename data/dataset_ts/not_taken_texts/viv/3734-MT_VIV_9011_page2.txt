Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV infection by controlling the viral load. Researchers
consider that these medicines worked well if the participants’ viral loads remained
undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre [c/mL]).
In this study, researchers wanted to see how well cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine
(RPV) injections maintained viral loads when given once every two months to adults
living with HIV who had an undetectable viral load. Researchers also assessed the
safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1 of this study, participants who had received daily CAB and RPV tablets in
Study LAI116482 could choose to be in one of the following two treatment groups:
• CAB and RPV group: Participants received CAB and RPV injections into the
muscle once every two months.
• Dolutegravir (DTG) and RPV group: Participants received a tablet containing
DTG and RPV once daily.
After Month 12, participants who chose to receive CAB and RPV injections could
choose to continue receiving them until these were available in their country.
Participants who chose to receive DTG and RPV could remain in the study only up to
Month 12.
