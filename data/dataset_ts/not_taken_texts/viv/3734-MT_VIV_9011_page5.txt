What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicines and/or injections. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent for this study or other
documents related to the study medicines.
The side effects in this summary have been collected from Day 1 to the data cut-off.
Injection-related side effects were collected only for participants in the CAB and RPV
group as DTG and RPV were given as a tablet.
Serious side effects
No serious side effects were reported in the DTG and RPV group.
One of 90 participants in the CAB and RPV group reported an injection-related serious
side effect of partial injection of the study medicine into blood vessel.
