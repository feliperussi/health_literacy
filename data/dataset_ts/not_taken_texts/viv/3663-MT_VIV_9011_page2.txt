Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV-1 infection by controlling the viral load. Researchers
consider that antiretroviral medicines worked well if the patients’ viral load remained
less than 50 copies per millilitre (c/mL).
When this study started, people living with HIV-1 infection were being treated with
three approved antiretroviral medicines. This was their current antiretroviral regimen
(CAR). Researchers wanted to see how a combination of monthly cabotegravir (CAB)
and rilpivirine (RPV) injections works in people living with HIV-1 infection compared
with daily CAR tablets. They also assessed the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
As shown in the figure below, on Day 1, patients were placed in one of the following
two treatment groups by chance (randomisation):
• CAB and RPV group: Patients received daily CAB and RPV tablets for four weeks.
Then they received monthly CAB and RPV injections.
• CAR group: Patients continued taking their daily CAR tablets for 52 weeks. Then
they switched to monthly CAB and RPV injections.
The patients and study doctors knew which treatment they received. This is called an
open-label study.
Study design
After Week 52, patients could choose to move to another similar study. Patients who
remained in this study after Week 96 continued receiving CAB and RPV until approved
in their country.
