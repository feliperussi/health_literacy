Number of participants
What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors collected blood samples and measured participantsâ€™ viral loads.
The study compared the number of participants in the two treatment groups, who had
a detectable viral load (50 c/mL or more) at Week 48.
One of 369 participants (less than 1%) in the DTG and 3TC group and two of
372 participants (less than 1%) in the TBR group had a detectable viral load at Week 48.
At Week 48, there were 24 participants (7%) in each treatment group with no results.
These participants either left the study before or missed the Week 48 visit.
