Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV infection by controlling the viral load. Researchers
consider that these medicines worked well if the participants’ viral loads reduced and
remained undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre [c/mL]).
Adults newly diagnosed with HIV who had not received antiretroviral treatment took
part in this study. Researchers wanted to see how well a combination of dolutegravir
(DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) works as part of the rapid test and treat model of care.
Researchers also assessed the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Participants with positive results from two different tests took part in the study. As part
of the rapid test and treat model of care, they were provided with DTG and 3TC on
Day 1, which was the same day or within 14 days of an HIV diagnosis.
On Day 1, study doctors also collected participants’ blood samples for other tests, the
results of which were available at a later visit. Participants with abnormal blood test
results, including those who had long-term hepatitis B virus infection or resistance to
DTG or 3TC, switched to a different antiretroviral treatment.
During the 52-week study, the participant and the study doctor knew which treatment
the participant received.
