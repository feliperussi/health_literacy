HIV medicines control the viral load by preventing HIV from making any more virus.
Researchers consider that these medicines are working well if the participants’ viral
load remains undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood [c/mL]). This
means levels of HIV measured by tests that are commonly used in clinics are too low to
harm the immune system.
Adults living with HIV with an undetectable viral load took part in this study. When this
study started, they were being treated with three or more approved HIV medicines.
This was their current antiretroviral regimen (CAR). Researchers wanted to see how
well a combination tablet of dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) maintained viral
loads in these participants compared with their CAR. They also assessed the safety of
these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, participants were placed in one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• DTG and 3TC group (two-medicine regimen): Participants switched from CAR to
receive DTG and 3TC tablet once daily for 52 weeks.
• CAR group (three- to four-medicine regimen): Participants continued taking CAR
for 52 weeks.
The main results of the study were reported at Week 48.
Each participant and their study doctor knew which treatment the participant received
(open-label study).
After Week 52, participants who got DTG and 3TC could choose to continue this study
medicine until it receives approval and is available in their country. Participants who
continued their CAR remained in the study only up to Week 52.
