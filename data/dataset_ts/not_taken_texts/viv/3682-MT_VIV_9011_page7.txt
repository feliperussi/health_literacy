How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The study showed that patients with HIV-1 infection in the two-medicine regimen
group had a similar response in reducing and maintaining a viral load of less than
50 c/mL compared with patients in the three-medicine regimen group. The side effects
reported in this study were as expected. More patients reported non-serious side
effects in the three-medicine regimen group compared with the two-medicine regimen
group.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of DTG and 3TC in patients with HIV-1 infection have been conducted and
some are ongoing or planned.
