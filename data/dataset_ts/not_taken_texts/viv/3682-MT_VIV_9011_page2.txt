Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV-1 infection by controlling the viral load. For this
study, antiretroviral medicines worked well if the patient’s viral load was reduced to
and remained less than 50 copies per millilitre (c/mL).
In this study, researchers wanted to compare a new two-medicine regimen with a
standard three-medicine regimen in patients with HIV-1 infection. They also assessed
the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, patients were placed in one of the following two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation).
• Two-medicine regimen group: Patients received dolutegravir (DTG) and
lamivudine (3TC) once daily.
• Three-medicine regimen group: Patients received DTG and a combination of
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) once daily.
The 148-week treatment period was divided into two phases, as shown in the figure
below. During the first 96 weeks, neither the patients nor the study doctors knew who
was receiving which treatment. This is called a double-blind phase. After Week 96, the
study doctor and patients knew which treatment they received. This is called an open-
label phase.
Study design
After Week 148, patients in the two-medicine regimen group could choose to continue
receiving DTG and 3TC in the study until they are approved for HIV treatment in their
country.
