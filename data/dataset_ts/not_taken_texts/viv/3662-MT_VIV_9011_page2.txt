Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV infection by controlling the viral load. Researchers
consider that these medicines worked well if the patients’ viral load was reduced and
remained undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre [c/mL]).
In this study, adults living with HIV infection who had not received HIV treatment were
given daily antiretroviral medicines as a single tablet. After 20 weeks, if their viral load
was undetectable, patients would continue taking the daily tablet and this became
their current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) or they were switched to begin receiving
cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV).
Researchers wanted to see how monthly CAB and RPV injections work compared with a
daily antiretroviral medicine tablet. Researchers also assessed the safety of these
medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients whose viral load was undetectable after receiving antiretroviral medicine for
20 weeks could enter the maintenance phase and then the extension phase.
On Day 1 of the maintenance phase, patients were placed in one of the following two
treatment groups by chance (randomisation):
• CAB and RPV group: Patients switched to daily CAB and RPV tablets for the first
four weeks. Then they moved to monthly CAB and RPV injections.
• CAR group: Patients continued taking the daily antiretroviral medicine tablet.
After Week 100, all patients with an undetectable viral load could choose to receive
monthly CAB and RPV injections until these study medicines were available in their
country. This is called the extension phase.
The patient and the study doctor knew which treatment the patient received.
