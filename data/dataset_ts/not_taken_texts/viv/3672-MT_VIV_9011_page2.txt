In this study, researchers wanted to compare bone strength in patients taking
dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV) with patients taking their current antiretroviral
regimens (CAR), which was a combination of three or more antiretroviral medicines
including tenofovir.
How was this study designed?
Some patients who were accepted to take part in one of the parent studies (201636 or
201637) could also be in this study. Links to the scientific summaries of these studies
are provided at the end of this document.
In the parent studies, patients were placed in one of the following two treatment
groups by chance (randomisation):
• DTG and RPV group: At Day 1, patients switched from CAR to receive DTG and
RPV.
• CAR group: Patients continued taking CAR and switched to DTG and RPV at
Week 52.
No additional study medicine was given in this study.
Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were performed on the total hip bone
and the lower spine. A DEXA scan is a special type of test that measures bone mineral
density, which is used to assess bone strength.
As shown in the figure below, DEXA scans were performed four times during the study.
