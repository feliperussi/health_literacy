How has this study helped participants and researchers?
This study showed that DTG and 3TC as part of the rapid test and treat model of care
are appropriate when given right after adults are newly diagnosed with HIV. Most
participants had a reduced viral load that was maintained at undetectable levels. The
side effects reported in this study were as expected and limited in number.
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. The results help government regulators make
decisions about new medicines for their country.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of DTG and 3TC in adults with HIV have been conducted and some are
ongoing or planned.
