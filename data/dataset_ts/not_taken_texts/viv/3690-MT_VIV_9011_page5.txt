What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. In this summary, side effects refer to
those events that the study doctor thinks may have been caused by the study
medicine.
The side effects in this summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent or
other documents related to the study medicine. A summary of all events reported in
this study may be found in the clinical results summary.
The side effects in this summary have been reported from Day 1 to about a year
(Week 48).
No participant died during the study.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that the combination tablet of DTG and 3TC had a similar
response in reducing and maintaining the viral load in adolescents newly diagnosed
with HIV compared with adults living with HIV. The non-serious side effect reported in
this study was as expected.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of DTG and 3TC in adults living with HIV have been completed. Some are
ongoing or planned. No further studies of DTG and 3TC in adolescents newly diagnosed
with HIV are planned at this time.
