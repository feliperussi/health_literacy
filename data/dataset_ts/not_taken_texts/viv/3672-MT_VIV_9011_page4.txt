What were the main results of the study?
The main focus of the study was to compare the total hip bone mineral density of
patients in both the treatment groups at Week 48. The difference between the total
hip bone mineral density values at Week 48 and at study start (baseline) is called
change from baseline. The percent change from baseline value could be calculated for
81 patients.
Results are shown in the table below.

Percent change from baseline 1.34% 0.05%
The percent change from baseline in total hip bone mineral density showed greater
improvement in patients taking DTG and RPV compared with patients taking CAR.
