The side effects in this summary have been reported from Day 1 to Week 52.
No serious side effects were reported in the study.
Non-serious side effects are side effects that do not result in death, hospitalisation or
disability. These were reported by 48 participants (20%) in the DTG and 3TC group and
16 participants (6%) in the CAR group. The table below shows the non-serious side
effects reported by 2% or more of participants in either treatment group.

How has this study helped participants and researchers?
The study showed that participants who switched to a combination tablet of DTG and
3TC had a similar response in maintaining an undetectable viral load compared with
participants who continued taking CAR.
The side effects reported in this study were as expected. More participants in the DTG
and 3TC group reported side effects compared with those in the CAR group. This could
be because participants in the CAR group continued receiving their current medicines
and were stable for several months before starting the study, while those in the DTG
and 3TC group had started new medicines.
This was a phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are.
