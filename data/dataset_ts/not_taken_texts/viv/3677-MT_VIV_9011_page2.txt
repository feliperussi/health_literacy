HIV medicines control the viral load by preventing HIV from making any more virus.
Researchers consider that these medicines are working well if the participants’ viral
load remains undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood [c/mL]). This
means levels of HIV measured by tests that are commonly used in clinics are too low to
harm the immune system.
Adults living with HIV with an undetectable viral load took part in this study. When this
study started, they were being treated with tenofovir alafenamide and at least two
more approved HIV medicines. This was their tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen
(TBR). Researchers wanted to see how well a combination tablet of dolutegravir (DTG)
and lamivudine (3TC) maintained viral loads in these participants compared with
continuing TBR. They also studied the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, participants were placed in one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• DTG and 3TC group (two-medicine regimen): Participants switched from TBR to
receive DTG and 3TC tablet once daily throughout the study.
• TBR group (three- to four-medicine regimen): Participants continued taking TBR.
At Week 148 (about three years), participants with an undetectable viral load
switch from TBR to DTG and 3TC.
Each participant and their study doctor knew which treatment the participant received
(open-label study).
After Week 200 (about four years), participants could continue receiving DTG and 3TC
in the study until this study medicine receives approval and is available in their country.
