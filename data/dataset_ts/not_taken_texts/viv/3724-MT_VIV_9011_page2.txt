Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV infection by controlling the viral load. Researchers
consider that these medicines worked well if the patients’ viral loads reduced and
remained undetectable (less than 50 copies per millilitre [c/mL]).
In this study, researchers compared cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) injections
when given once every 8 weeks with once every 4 weeks to adults living with HIV
infection. Researchers wanted to assess how well these medicines worked and how
safe they were.
Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women with HIV infection were included in the study if they:
• Were at least 18 years old.
• Received antiretroviral medicines continuously for at least six months
before starting the study.
• Had viral load levels that were both controlled for a year and reduced to
undetectable levels before starting the study.
Men and women were excluded from the study if they had:
• Known resistance to certain medicines used to treat HIV infection.
• Any other disease(s) or taken any medicine(s) that the study doctor
thought would affect the results of the study.
Some of the patients in this study had taken part in a previous study (Study 201585).
