What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors collected blood samples and measured patients’ viral load on Day 1 and
during the study.
The table below shows the results for patients who had viral load assessed as:
• 50 c/mL or more at Week 48 or at their last test before they stopped taking part
in the study.
• Less than 50 c/mL at Week 48.
Number of patients (percent) by viral load

50 c/mL or more 5 (2%) 3 (1%)
Less than 50 c/mL 285 (93%) 294 (95%)
More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicines and/or injections. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent for this study or other
documents related to the study medicines.
