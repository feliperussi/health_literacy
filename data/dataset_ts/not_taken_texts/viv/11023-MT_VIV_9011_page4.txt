What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors collected blood samples and measured participants’ viral load.
The table below shows the Week 24 and Week 48 results for participants who were still
in the study and had viral load data when the results were assessed as:
• Detectable: 50 c/mL or more.
• Undetectable: Less than 50 c/mL.
Number of participants (percent) by viral load

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by DTG and 3TC. The side effects in this summary may be different to
those in the Informed Consent for this study or other documents related to DTG and
3TC.
The side effects in this summary have been reported from Day 1 to Week 52.
No serious side effects were reported.
