How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Adults with HIV-1 resistant to multiple antiretroviral medicines and failing their
current treatment took part in this study. The study showed that fostemsavir was
better than placebo in decreasing viral load after eight days of treatment.
During the open-label phase, the percentage of participants with an undetectable
viral load was maintained. The average CD4+ T cell counts increased over time.
The side effects reported in this study were as expected.
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. The results help government regulators
make decisions about new medicines for their country.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fostemsavir in adults with HIV-1 have been conducted and some are
ongoing or planned.
