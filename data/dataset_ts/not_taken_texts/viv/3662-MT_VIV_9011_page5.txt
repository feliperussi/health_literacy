What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicines and/or injections. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent for this study or other
documents related to the study medicines.
The side effects in this summary have been reported from Day 1 to Week 124.
Serious side effects
One of the 283 patients (less than 1%) in the CAB and RPV group had a serious side
effect of inflammation in the joints.
No serious side effects were reported in the CAR group from Day 1 to Week 100. Of the
283 patients in the CAR group, 232 patients switched from CAR to CAB and RPV at
