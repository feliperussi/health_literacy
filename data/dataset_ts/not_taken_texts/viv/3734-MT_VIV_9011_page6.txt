How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Adults living with HIV, who were taking daily CAB and RPV tablets previously, took part
in this study. Almost all participants chose to receive CAB and RPV injections given once
every two months. At Month 12, all participants in the study maintained undetectable
viral load levels. The side effects reported in this study were as expected and limited in
number.
