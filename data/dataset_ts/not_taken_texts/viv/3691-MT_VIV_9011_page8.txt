Study doctors also measured participantâ€™s CD4+ T cell counts, as number of cells per
cubic millimetre (cells/mm3) at baseline (before taking the first dose of the study
medicine) and at Week 24, Week 48, and Week 96. The difference in these counts
between the visits and baseline was called the change from baseline. Results are
shown in the figure below.

More information about the study results is available in the scientific results
summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive
a medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be
found in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at
the end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they
record this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction). In this summary, side effects
refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may have been caused by the
study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be different to those in the
Informed Consent for this study or other documents related to the study medicine.
