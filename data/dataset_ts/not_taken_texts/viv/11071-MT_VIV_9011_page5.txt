More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
Medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (also called adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicines. The side effects in this summary may be new
(unexpected) and different to the expected side effects mentioned in the Informed
Consent for this study or other documents related to the study medicines.
