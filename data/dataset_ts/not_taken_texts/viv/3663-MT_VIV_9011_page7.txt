Side effects after Week 52
Between Week 52 and Week 96, most patients in either treatment group chose to
move to another similar study. Of the 616 patients, only 51 patients remained in this
study at Week 96.
At Week 96, only 23 of 308 patients remained in the CAB and RPV group. Of the
308 patients in the CAR group, 174 patients switched from CAR to CAB and RPV at
Week 52. Only 28 of these patients continued to receive CAB and RPV up to Week 96.
No serious side effects were reported by patients in either treatment group after
Week 52.
The non-serious side effects reported by patients in either treatment group after
Week 52 were similar to those reported by patients in the CAB and RPV group up to
Week 52. The most common side effects reported in both treatment groups after
Week 52 were injection-related side effects.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The study showed that people living with HIV-1 infection receiving a combination of
monthly CAB and RPV injections had a similar response in maintaining the viral load
compared with patients taking their daily CAR tablets. The side effects reported in this
study were not unexpected and were limited in number.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of CAB and RPV in people living with HIV-1 infection have been
conducted and some are ongoing or planned.
