No non-serious side effects were reported by 5% or more of patients in the CAR group
from Day 1 to Week 100. The table below shows the non-serious side effects that were
reported by 5% or more of patients who switched from CAR to CAB and RPV at
Week 100.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study compared monthly CAB and RPV injections with a daily antiretroviral
medicine tablet in adults living with HIV infection who had not received antiretroviral
medicines before enrolling in this study. Researchers concluded that patients in both
treatment groups had a similar response in maintaining an undetectable viral load. The
side effects reported in this study were not unexpected and were limited in number.
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. The results help government regulators make
decisions about new medicines for their country.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of CAB and RPV in adults living with HIV infection have been conducted
and some are ongoing or planned.
