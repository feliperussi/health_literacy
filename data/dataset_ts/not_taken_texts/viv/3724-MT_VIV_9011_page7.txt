How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers concluded that CAB and RPV injections showed a similar response when
given once every 8 weeks compared with once every 4 weeks to adults living with HIV
infection. The side effects reported in this study were not unexpected and were limited
in number.
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. The results help government regulators make
decisions about new medicines for their country.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of CAB and RPV in adults living with HIV infection have been conducted
and some are ongoing or planned.
