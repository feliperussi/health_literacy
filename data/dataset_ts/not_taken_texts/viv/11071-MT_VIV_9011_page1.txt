General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in November 2019. Enrolment was closed, but the study was ongoing
when this summary was finalised.
What was the main objective of this study?
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) damages the bodyâ€™s defence system
(immune system). It weakens the ability to fight infections and increases the risk of
developing diseases when not treated effectively. The HIV has ribonucleic acid (RNA) as
its genetic material. Doctors can check the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) by
measuring HIV RNA levels in the blood.
