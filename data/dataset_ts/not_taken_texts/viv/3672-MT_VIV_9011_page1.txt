General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in June 2015 and ended in August 2018.
What was the main objective of this study?
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) damages the bodyâ€™s defence system
(immune system) and weakens the ability to fight infections and diseases.
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV-1 infection. Some people treated with
antiretroviral medicines will lose strength in their bones. Researchers have seen this
effect with a medicine called tenofovir.
