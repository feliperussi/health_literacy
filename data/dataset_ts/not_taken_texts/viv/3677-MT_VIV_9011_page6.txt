Serious side effects
Serious side effects were reported by one participant (less than 1%) in the DTG and 3TC
group and one participant (less than 1%) in the TBR group. The participant in the DTG
and 3TC group had higher than normal levels of a liver protein in the blood. The
participant in the TBR group had swelling under the skin.
Non-serious side effects
Non-serious side effects are side effects that do not result in death, hospitalisation or
disability. These were reported by 54 participants (15%) in the DTG and 3TC group and
17 participants (5%) in the TBR group. The table below shows the non-serious side
effects that were reported by 1% or more of participants in either treatment group.

How has this study helped participants and researchers?
The study showed that participants who switched to a combination tablet of DTG and
3TC had a similar response in maintaining an undetectable viral load compared with
participants who continued taking TBR.
The side effects reported in this study were as expected. More participants in the DTG
and 3TC group reported side effects compared with those in the TBR group. This could
be because participants in the TBR group continued receiving their current medicines
