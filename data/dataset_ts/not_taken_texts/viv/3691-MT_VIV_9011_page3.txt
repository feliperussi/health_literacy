Randomised group
Participants whose current treatment included one or two antiretroviral medicines
that could be combined with the study medicine to work against the resistant virus
were included in the randomised group.
For the double-blind phase (8 days), these participants were placed in one of the
two treatment groups by chance (randomisation). Three times as many participants
received fostemsavir compared with placebo.
• Fostemsavir group: Participants received fostemsavir tablets twice daily and
continued taking their current failing treatment.
• Placebo group: Participants received placebo (no active medicine) tablets
twice daily and continued taking their current failing treatment.
During the double-blind phase, neither the participant nor the study doctor knew
which treatment the participant received.
From the start of the open-label phase, all participants who completed the double-
blind phase received fostemsavir along with the optimised treatment regimen.
Non-randomised group
Additional participants whose current treatment did not include any antiretroviral
medicine that could work against the resistant virus were included in the
non-randomised group.
Participants in the non-randomised group received fostemsavir and optimised
treatment regimen during the open-label phase.
Participants in both the randomised and non-randomised groups and the study
doctor knew which treatment the participant received during the open-label phase.
