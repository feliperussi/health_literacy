Doctors monitor the amount of HIV-1 in the body (viral load) by measuring HIV-1
RNA levels in the blood. Antiretroviral medicines treat HIV-1 infection by controlling
the viral load. Researchers consider that these medicines work well if the
participants’ viral load reduces and remains undetectable (less than 40 copies per
millilitre [c/mL]).
Another test of the effect of HIV-1 on the immune system is CD4+ T cell count.
T cells are white blood cells that fight infection. Adults with poorly controlled HIV-1
have low CD4+ T cell counts.
Adults with HIV-1 resistant to multiple antiretroviral medicines and failing their
current treatment (viral load of 400 c/mL or more) took part in this study.
Researchers wanted to see how well fostemsavir works in these participants when
added to their current failing treatment for 8 days. Researchers also assessed how
well fostemsavir works when given long-term with an optimised treatment regimen.
This regimen was a combination of medicines chosen by the study doctor based on
participant’s treatment history and laboratory test results. They also assessed the
safety of fostemsavir.
Which medicine was studied?
The study was conducted in two parts (phases), as shown in the figure below.
Results were collected at the end of the 8-day double-blind phase and at Week 24,
Week 48, and Week 96 of the open-label phase.
Study design
After Week 96, participants could choose to continue receiving fostemsavir in the
study until it was approved and available in their country.
