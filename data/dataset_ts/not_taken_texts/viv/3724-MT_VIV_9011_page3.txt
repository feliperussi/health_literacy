Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, patients were placed in one of the following two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation).
• CAB and RPV once every 8 weeks group: Patients received CAB and RPV
injections once every 8 weeks up to Week 100.
• CAB and RPV once every 4 weeks group: Patients received CAB and RPV
injections once every 4 weeks up to Week 100.
Patients who had never received CAB and RPV were given these study medicines as
tablets for the first four weeks. After that, they received CAB and RPV injections.
The patient and the study doctor knew which treatment the patient received.
After Week 100, patients could choose to continue receiving CAB and RPV injections in
the study until these study medicines were available in their country.
