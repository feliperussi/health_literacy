HIV medicines control the viral load by preventing it from making more virus.
Researchers consider that these medicines are working well if the participants’ viral
load is less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood (c/mL). This means the levels of HIV in
the blood is undetectable. These levels are considered to be too low to harm the
immune system and are commonly tested in clinics to assess a participant’s HIV status.
A combination tablet for HIV is approved in a few countries to treat adults living with
HIV. Adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) who are newly diagnosed with HIV
and have not yet received HIV treatment took part in this study. Researchers wanted to
see if the same combination tablet could reduce and maintain an undetectable viral
load in these participants. They also studied the safety of these medicines and
compared the results from this study with results from previous studies in adults living
with HIV.
Which medicines were studied?
A combination tablet of HIV medicines dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) was
studied.
This is an open-label study where the participants and their study doctor knew which
treatment the participant received. From Day 1, all participants in this study received
the combination tablet of DTG and 3TC once daily as shown in the figure below.
The participants who completed three years of treatment (Week 144) could continue
receiving the study medicine until it receives approval and is available in their country.
