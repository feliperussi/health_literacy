How did the patients’ overall quality of life compare between the
2 treatments after 26 weeks of treatment?
Each patient rated their health, ability to function, and symptoms of PNH on a questionnaire.
An improvement in their questionnaire score of 10 or more indicated a change in quality of life.
More patients who got ravulizumab had a change in their quality of
life at the end of the treatment period compared with patients who
got eculizumab.
Summary of answers:
Following 26 weeks of treatment ravulizumab was considered to work as well as eculizumab as it:
• Lowered LDH enzyme levels
• Blocked the destruction of the red blood cells
• Reduced breakthrough hemolysis
• Reduced tiredness
• Reduced the need for a blood transfusion
• Stabilized hemoglobin levels
• Improved the patients’ overall quality of life
SIDE EFFECTS
How is the safety of participants in clinical studies monitored?
A side effect is any symptom or clinical finding that occurs during the study. For example, a
participant might get a headache or have abnormal blood test results. Side effects can vary from
person to person. A lot of research is needed to see which side effects the study treatment causes
and which side effects happen by chance. So, researchers keep a record of all the side effects
participants have when new treatments are studied.
Any side effect thought to be an important medical event, requires a person to go to the hospital,
could be life-threatening, or causes death, is called a serious side effect. A serious side effect may or
may not be related to the treatment the participant was taking.
