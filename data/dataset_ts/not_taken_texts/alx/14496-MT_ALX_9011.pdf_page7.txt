Were there any changes in the patients’ symptoms of PNH?
At the beginning of the study, all patients were asked whether they were experiencing tiredness,
stomach pain, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, or chest pain. Men were also asked if
they had difficulty keeping an erection.
Those patients who had symptoms of PNH were asked again after 36 weeks of treatment if
they continued to experience these symptoms or not. The results below show the combined
responses of patients in all 4 groups.

Did any of the patients need a blood transfusion?
The researchers wanted to know how many patients had a blood transfusion before the start of
the study. They then looked at how many of those patients needed a blood transfusion during the
treatment period. Overall, 7 out of 26 patients had a blood transfusion within 12 months before the
start of the study.
Of those patients requiring a blood transfusion before the start of the
57% study, 57% needed a further blood transfusion during the treatment
period and 43% did not.
