STUDY RESULTS
Answers to the main questions:
What percentage of patients who got ravulizumab did
not need a blood transfusion compared to patients who
got eculizumab?
The researchers wanted to see if ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab at reducing the need for
a blood transfusion during the 26-week treatment period.
RAVULIZUMAB ECULIZUMAB
@ 80 out of 121 patients
The results showed that 74% of patients who got ravulizumab did not need a blood transfusion
compared to 66% of patients who got eculizumab.
º How did hemolysis compare between the 2 treatments?
During hemolysis, the destruction of the red blood cells causes the release ofa n enzyme called
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the blood. LDH levels show how much hemolysis is happening in
the body. Both ravulizumab and eculizumab aim to block hemolysis. If the treatment is working and
blocking hemolysis, then the patients’ LDH level should return within the normal range.
RAVULIZUMAB ECULIZUMAB
f125 patients @ 60 out of 121 patients
The results showed that 54% of patients who got ravulizumab had their LDH level return within the
normal range during the treatment period compared to 49% of patients who got eculizumab. These
levels remained stable during treatment for more than half of the patients in each group.
