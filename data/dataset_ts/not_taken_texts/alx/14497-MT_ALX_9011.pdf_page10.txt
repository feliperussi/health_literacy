Were there any other important safety findings in this study?
Complement inhibitors increase a patient's risk of meningococcal
infection. An independent group was in place to monitor all
patients for any cases of meningococcal infection. There were no
meningococcal infections reported in either treatment group.
None of the patients who got either treatment stopped taking part because of the side effects they
had. 1 patient who got eculizumab chose not to carry on in the study. Another patient who got
eculizumab stopped taking part on the advice of the study doctor. No patients died during their
participation in Part 1 of this study.
OUTCOME OF THE STUDY
The results showed that ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab at treating patients with PNH
who had not previously had treatment with a complement inhibitor. The side effects experienced
were similar in both treatment groups. Ravulizumab was considered safe and was well tolerated.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The information collected in this study was from one of the largest clinical studies in patients who
had never had treatment with eculizumab. From a patient and health care perspective, being able to
take ravulizumab once every 8 weeks, compared to eculizumab once every 2 weeks, may reduce the
burden of treatment.
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to use, researchers
look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safe. If you have any questions about ravulizumab or
eculizumab for the treatment of PNH, please talk to your doctor.
You should not change your treatment based on the results of this
study without talking to a doctor first.
