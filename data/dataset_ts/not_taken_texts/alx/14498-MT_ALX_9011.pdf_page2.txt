BACKGROUND
What are clinical studies?
Clinical studies aim to answer specific questions about new or existing treatments, procedures, or
vaccines and involve patients with health conditions or healthy volunteers. Clinical studies happen
in several phases from phase 1 to 4.
This study was a phase 3. Phase 3 studies look at the overall risks and benefits of a new treatment
compared to the routine treatment or care for the condition studied. In this study, ravulizumab was
compared with eculizumab in adult patients with PNH who were being treated with eculizumab and
doing well.
What is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria?
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, also called PNH, is a very rare, life-threatening, lifelong blood
disorder. In PNH, some or all of the red blood cells lack important protective proteins. Without
these protective proteins, the body’s natural defense system, also called the immune system,
destroys the red blood cells. This process is known as hemolysis.

For people living with PNH, hemolysis is always happening and can result in serious health problems.
What are the symptoms of PNH?
The most common symptoms of PNH include feeling tired, difficulty
swallowing, trouble concentrating or thinking, shortness of breath, stomach
pain, dark-colored urine, and, for men, difficulty keeping an erection.
The lack of healthy red blood cells, known as anemia or being anemic,
is a serious complication of PNH, which often results in patients needing
blood transfusions.
Life-threatening complications from PNH can include blood clots, kidney failure, and other
organ damage.
