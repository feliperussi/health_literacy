PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
What were the researchers trying to find out in this study?
The researchers wanted to see if 2 different doses of ravulizumab worked at treating symptoms of
PNH in patients who had never had treatment with a complement inhibitor. They also wanted to
see if different doses of ravulizumab lowered the patients’ LDH level and reduced hemolysis.
The side effects of ravulizumab and how patients tolerated the different doses were also looked at.
This study had 2 parts. Part 1 started in November 2015 and ended in
July 2016. This summary provides the results of Part 1, which is when all
patients had received at least 24 weeks of treatment. The plan is for Part 2
to finish in 2022 and the results made available in 2023.
What was the main question?
Did 24 weeks of treatment lower the patients’
LDH level?
Were there any other important questions?
Did ravulizumab have an effect on the patients’ red blood cells?
Were there any changes in the patients’ symptoms of PNH?
Did any of the patients need a blood transfusion?
Did the patients’ tiredness reduce or worsen?
Did ravulizumab improve the patients’ overall quality of life?
