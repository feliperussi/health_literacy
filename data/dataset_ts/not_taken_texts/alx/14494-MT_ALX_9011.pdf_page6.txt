How unwell were the patients at the start of the study?
Nearly all of the patients who took part in the study were very unwell. Half of the patients had
needed treatment in an intensive care unit for an average of 10 days. At the start of the study,
48 out of 56 patients (86%) were in hospital because of aHUS, and 8 out of 58 patients (14%)
