STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Who could take part?
To be able to take part in the study, patients had to meet the following requirements:
Male or female, 18 years Confirmed diagnosis Taken eculizumab for Hemolysis confirmed by
of age or older of PNH with 1 or more at least 6 months, and a blood test
related sign or symptom doing well
Any patient who never had eculizumab treatment or had been unwell due to a fever or infection
could not take part. Any patient who had a hemolysis blood test result that was more than 2 times
higher than the normal level could not take part.
Complement inhibitors increase a patient’s risk of meningococcal infection. A meningococcal
infection is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. This results in swelling around the
brain and spinal cord or infections in the blood. To help prevent meningococcal infection, all
patients needed to have had a meningococcal vaccination no more than 3 years before taking part.
If they previously had a meningococcal infection, they could not take part.
