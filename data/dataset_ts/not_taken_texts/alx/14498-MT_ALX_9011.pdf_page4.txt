PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
What were the researchers trying to find out in this study?
The researchers wanted to see if ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab at treating symptoms
of PNH in patients who had been treated with eculizumab for at least 6 months. The side effects
of both treatments, which is called the safety of the study, were also looked at. The study was not
designed to see if one treatment was better than the other.
The study had 2 parts. Part 1 started in June 2017 and ended in March 2018.
This summary provides the results of Part 1, which is when all patients
had received 26 weeks of treatment. The plan is for Part 2 to finish in 2021
and the results made available within 12 months.
What was the main question?
How did hemolysis compare between patients who
got ravulizumab and patients who got eculizumab
after 26 weeks of treatment?
Were there any other important questions?
What percentage of patients in each treatment group had breakthrough hemolysis after
26 weeks of treatment?
How did tiredness levels compare between the 2 treatments after 26 weeks of treatment?
What percentage of patients who got ravulizumab did not need a blood transfusion
compared to patients who got eculizumab after 26 weeks of treatment?
What percentage of patients in each treatment group had stable hemoglobin levels after
26 weeks of treatment?
How did the patients’ overall quality of life compare between the 2 treatments after 26 weeks
of treatment?
