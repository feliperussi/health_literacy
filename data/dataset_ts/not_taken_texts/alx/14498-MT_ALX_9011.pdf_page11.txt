Were there any other important safety findings in this study?
Complement inhibitors increase a patient’s risk of meningococcal
infection. An independent group was in place to monitor all
patients for any cases of meningococcal infection. There were no
meningococcal infections reported in either treatment group.
None of the patients who got either treatment stopped taking part because of the side effects they
had. No patients died during their participation in Part 1 of this study.
OUTCOME OF THE STUDY
The results showed that ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab at treating patients with PNH
who previously had treatment with eculizumab. The side effects experienced were similar in both
treatment groups. Ravulizumab was considered safe and well tolerated.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The information collected in this study was from patients with PNH who were getting eculizumab for
at least 6 months. From a patient and healthcare perspective, patients who were getting eculizumab
could safely switch to ravulizumab. Being able to take ravulizumab once every 8 weeks, compared to
eculizumab once every 2 weeks, may reduce the burden of treatment.
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to use, researchers
look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safe. If you have any questions about ravulizumab or
eculizumab for the treatment of PNH, please talk to your doctor. You
should not change your treatment based on the results of this study
without talking to a doctor first.
