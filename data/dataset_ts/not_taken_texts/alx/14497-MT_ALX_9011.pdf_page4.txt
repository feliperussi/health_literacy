PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
What were the researchers trying to find out in this study?
The researchers wanted to see if ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab at treating patients
with PNH who had never had treatment with a complement inhibitor. The side effects of both
treatments, which is called the safety of the study, were also looked at. The study was not done to
see if one treatment was better than the other.
The study had 2 parts. Part 1 started in December 2016 and ended in
January 2018. This summary provides the results of Part 1, which is when
all patients had received 26 weeks of treatment. The plan is for Part 2 to
finish in 2023, and the results be made available in 2024.
What were the main questions?
What percentage of patients who got ravulizumab did not need a blood transfusion
compared to patients who got eculizumab?
e How did hemolysis compare between the 2 treatments?
Were there any other important questions?
How did tiredness levels compare between the 2 treatments?
What percentage of patients in each treatment group had breakthrough hemolysis"?
What percentage of patients in each treatment group had stable hemoglobin levels?
How did the patients' overall quality of life compare between the 2 treatments?
ABreakthrough hemolysis means a patient experienced an increase in enzyme levels and a new or worsening symptom,
or a serious complication, during treatment.
