To be able to take part in the study, patients had to meet the following requirements:
Male or female, 18 years PNH confirmed by blood High levels of LDH
of age or older or bone marrow sample confirmed by 2 blood tests
Patients were unable to take part if they had previously had treatment with ravulizumab or
eculizumab, or if they were unwell due to a fever or infection.
Complement inhibitors increase a patient’s risk of meningococcal infection. A meningococcal
infection is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. This results in swelling around the
brain and spinal cord or infections in the blood. To help prevent meningococcal infection, all
patients needed to have had a meningococcal vaccination no more than 3 years before taking part.
If they had previously had a meningococcal infection, they could not take part.
