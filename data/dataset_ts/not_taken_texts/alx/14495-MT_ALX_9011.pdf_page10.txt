What serious side effects did patients have in this study?
None of the patients had a serious side effect.
Were there any other important safety findings in this study?
Complement inhibitors increase a patient’s risk of meningococcal
infection. An independent group was in place to monitor all
patients for any cases of meningococcal infection. There were no
meningococcal infections reported during 24 weeks of treatment.
None of the patients stopped taking part because of the side effects they had. No patients died
during their participation in this study.
OUTCOME OF THE STUDY
The results showed that both doses of ravulizumab lowered the patients’ LDH level and
reduced hemolysis. Patients experienced improved symptoms of PNH and overall quality of life.
Ravulizumab was considered safe and well tolerated.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was the first study of ravulizumab in patients with PNH. The information collected from this
study helped the researchers plan a further study to determine the most appropriate dose of
ravulizumab for patients with PNH.
Before a treatment can be approved for patients to use, researchers
look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work
best and are safe. If you have any questions about ravulizumab for the
treatment of PNH, please talk to your doctor. You should not change
your treatment based on the results of this study without talking to a
doctor first.
