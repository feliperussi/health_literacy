Why was the study done?
 This was a phase 2 study, the second part of the development of medicines for
humans. Researchers wanted to learn if this investigational treatment
(tezepelumab) could help participants with atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a
condition where the skin is itchy, red, swollen, and cracked. Clear fluid may
come from the affected areas. Scratching the affected areas worsens the
symptoms and increases the risk of skin infections.
 In this study, researchers wanted to measure the effect of tezepelumab treating
AD compared with placebo. The effect of tezepelumab was measured using
2 tools, the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) and the Eczema Area and
Severity Index (EASI).
 The IGA was a way for physicians to measure the severity of AD signs of skin
rash, redness, and thickness. An IGA score of 0 means clear of AD signs; IGA
score of 1 means almost clear; an IGA score of 2 means mild signs; IGA
score of 3 means moderate signs; an IGA score of 4 means severe; and an
IGA score of 5 means very severe.
 EASI was scored using the severity of redness, deepness of skin thickening,
amount of broken skin from scratching, and thick skin lines. This score was
calculated based on the severity of AD symptoms and how much body
surface was affected by AD.
 Researchers wanted to find out if participants could achieve an IGA score of
0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) (IGA 0/1) at week 16, or reduction in the EASI score
of at least 75% from the first measurement (EASI 75) at week 16.
 Researchers also wanted to compare the safety of tezepelumab to a placebo.
 A placebo was chosen as the comparator for tezepelumab in this study.
