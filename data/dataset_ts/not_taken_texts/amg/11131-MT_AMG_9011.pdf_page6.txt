6. WHAT WERE THE SIDE EFFECTS?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called a side effect)?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen
when you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record all unwanted
medical problems that occur during the study, including side effects that they believe
are possibly caused by the investigational medicine each patient is receiving. These
are also called “adverse reactions.”
What side effects related to the treatment were seen?
When reporting side effects in this study, the study doctor did not know which
treatment a participant was receiving. A side effect was recorded as “serious” if it
caused death, was life threatening, required the participant to stay in a hospital, or
the study doctor thought it was clinically significant enough to be recorded as
“serious”.
