Study Design
Neither the participants nor the study doctor could choose the treatment the
participants received. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment group by
chance (randomized). This is like flipping a coin or drawing numbers out of a hat.
Neither the participants nor the doctors knew which treatment each participant was
given (double-blinded) until after the study was over. This was done to make sure
the study results were not influenced in any way.
Part A of the study consisted of:
 28-day screening period; participants stopped all AD treatment except for
moisturizers or lotions for at least 7 days before the first day of the study
 52-week treatment period; all participants received a 420 mg SC dose
(tezepelumab or placebo) as the first dose and then received their assigned dose
starting at the week 2 visit
 20-week safety follow-up period
