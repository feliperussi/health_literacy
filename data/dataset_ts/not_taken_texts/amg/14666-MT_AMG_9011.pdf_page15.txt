8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
 This study contributed to the relevant area of research and potential next steps to
build on that knowledge.
 These results are the outcome of one study – and other studies may show
something different (either already done or future studies).
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of
251 participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Not all participants in
each part of the study had the same results. The results for any single participant
could have been better or worse than the results for their group. Other studies may
find different results. These results do not explain how a treatment may work in a
single person. Many studies are needed to show the benefits and risks of a
medicine that is still being tested. This research may help future participants and
families by helping doctors understand more about the treatment being studied.
