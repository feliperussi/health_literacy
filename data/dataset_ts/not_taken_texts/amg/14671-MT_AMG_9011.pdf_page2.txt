3. General Information About the Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
 This study took place in Australia, France, Greece, and the United States.
 The study began in August 2018 and ended in July 2019.
 The study was stopped earlier than planned because Amgen decided not to
continue development of AMG 397. This was due to a business decision and not
due to any safety concerns.
Why was the study done?
 This was a phase 1 study conducted in participants with certain cancers of the
blood and lymph system, as part of the early process to develop new medicines
for humans. Researchers looked at how this medicine that was still being tested
works in the body and the effect that it has in the body, including side effects.
 In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of AMG 397 and
determine the optimal dose to test in further studies.
