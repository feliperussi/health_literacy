complications. Denosumab is currently approved in some countries for the
prevention of bone complications in adults who have multiple myeloma with bone
lesions.
This was a phase 3 study, which is in the late stage of the development process of
medicines for humans. Researchers compared denosumab to zoledronic acid,
which is a type of bisphosphonate medicine. It is a standard treatment used for
preventing bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma.
The main purpose of this study was to show that denosumab was not worse than
zoledronic acid at preventing bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma.
To do so, researchers looked at how many days participants who took denosumab
went without a bone complication, compared to participants who took zoledronic
acid.
