Men and women at least 18 years old were examined by a study doctor and chosen to be in
the study if they:
 had been diagnosed with PsA
 had at least 3 swollen joints, 3 tender joints, and had at least 1 patch of psoriasis on
their skin that was about 1 inch (2 centimeters) or larger
 were not using MTX, and had not used etanercept or a medicine similar to etanercept
in the past
 had not changed their current PsA treatment recently
 did not have serious medical conditions, such as uncontrolled diabetes, heart failure,
liver disease, kidney disease, or immune system diseases
 were not pregnant and were not planning to become pregnant, and were willing to
prevent pregnancy in a female partner
4. Which Medicines Were Studied?
In this study, etanercept + MTX was compared to MTX + placebo, and etanercept + placebo
was compared to MTX + placebo. Participants had an equal chance of receiving any of the
3 study medicine combinations.
Neither the participants nor the study doctors could choose which treatment participants
devorppA
were given. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment group by chance (“randomized”)
using an automated computer system. This is like flipping a coin or drawing numbers out of
a hat.
This was a “double-blinded” study, which means that the participants and the study doctors
could only find out which treatment the participant was given after the initial treatment period
was over and the entire study was completed. This was done to make sure the study results
were not influenced in any way.
Participants were examined by study doctors at each visit to the study center. After
24 weeks of treatment, any participants who still had PsA symptoms received etanercept +
MTX treatment. This was called the “rescue period”. After another 24 weeks of treatment,
all participants had a final checkup to see how they were feeling.
