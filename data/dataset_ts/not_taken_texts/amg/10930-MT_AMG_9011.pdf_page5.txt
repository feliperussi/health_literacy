after the study was over. This was done to make sure the study results were not
influenced in any way.
After being randomly assigned to a treatment group, participants were given either
40 mg of ABP 501 or 40 mg of the adalimumab reference product as an injection under
their skin. Participants continued the same treatment every 2 weeks for up to 22 weeks.
Participants were examined by study doctors at each visit to the study center, up to
24 weeks after starting treatment. At some of these visits, participants answered
questions on several different forms about their RA symptoms. 2 weeks after the
treatment finished, participants had a final checkup to see how they were feeling after
the study treatment ended.

All 526 participants in the study were given at least 1 dose of either ABP 501 or
adalimumab. Of those who started the study, 494 participants (243 in the ABP 501
group and 251 in the adalimumab group) completed the study. 32 participants did not
complete the study for these reasons: 17 participants chose not to take part anymore,
5 left due to side effects, 5 left for other reasons, 4 lost contact with the study site, and
1 left after not following the study instructions.
6. What Were the Side Effects?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called side effects)?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen when
you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record side effects that they
believe are possibly caused by the investigational medicine each patient is
receiving. These are also called “adverse reactions.”
