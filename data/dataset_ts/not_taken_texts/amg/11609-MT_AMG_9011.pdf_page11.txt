8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of
1718 people with multiple myeloma and bone lesions. Not all participants in the
study had the same results. The results for any single participant could have been
better or worse than the results for their group. Other studies may find different
results. These results do not explain how a treatment may work in a single person.
Many studies are needed to show the benefits and risks of a medicine that is still
being tested. This research may help future participants and families by helping
doctors understand more about the treatment being studied.
