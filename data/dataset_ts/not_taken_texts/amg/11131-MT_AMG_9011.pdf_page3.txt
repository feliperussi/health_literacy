Clinical Study Results
ABP 710 is another IV biologic medicine. It also attaches to TNF to keep it from
triggering the immune system. ABP 710 was created to be highly similar to
infliximab. Once a new biologic product has been tested and is shown to be highly
similar to a reference biologic product, it is called a “biosimilar.” In clinical studies
like this one, ABP 710 is called an investigational medicine, and infliximab is called
the reference product.

study in this study
This was a phase 3 study, which is usually the last stage for testing investigational
medicines in humans before they are approved for use. The main purpose of the
study was to compare RA symptom improvement in participants who were given
ABP 710 to those who were given the infliximab reference product, 22 weeks after
starting treatment.
4. WHAT PATIENTS/PEOPLE WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY?
Who took part in the study?
This study included 558 adult men and women with moderate to severe RA. Of the
558 participants, 437 participants (78%, or about 8 out of 10) were women and
121 participants (22%, or about 2 out of 10) were men. Participants ranged in age
from 19 to 77 years old. The average age of all participants was about 55 years old.
