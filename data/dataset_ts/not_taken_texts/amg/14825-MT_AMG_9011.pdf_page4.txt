Participants were examined by a study doctor and chosen to be in the study if they
met certain study requirements
 Were 20 years or older
 Were diagnosed with PPP at least 5 and a half months before starting the
study
 Had moderate or severe pustules on palms or soles as measured by the
study doctor
 Had not had success in treating their PPP with topical steroid and/or Vitamin
D3 preparations.
5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
In this study, apremilast was compared to a placebo. Participants had an equal
chance of receiving either apremilast or a placebo. This study had 4 parts: a 4-week
screening part, 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled part, a 16-week open-label
part and a 4-week follow-up part where no medicine was taken by the participants.
In the double-blind part of the study, neither the participants nor the study doctor
could choose the medicine the participants received. Participants agreed to be put
into a medicine group by chance (“randomized”). This is like flipping a coin or
drawing numbers out of a hat.
During the double-blind part of the study, neither the participants nor the doctors
knew which medicine each participant was given until after the study was over. This
was done to make sure the study results were not influenced in any way. This was
known as the double-blind part of the study. Each participant took either 30 mg
apremilast or placebo twice a day for 16 weeks.
At the end of 16 weeks, the participants had their PPP evaluated by their doctors.
Participants then continued the study with open-label 30 mg apremilast twice a day
for another 16 weeks as shown in the graphic below.
 Open-label means that both the participants and the study doctors knew what
medicine the participants received.
