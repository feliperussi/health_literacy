How Did ABP 710 Compare to Infliximab in Improving Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?
3. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CLINICAL STUDY
Where and when was the study done?
• This study took place in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic,
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the United States.
• The study began in October 2016 and ended in August 2018.
• The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
This study was done to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis (also known as “RA”).
RA is a disease that causes pain and swelling (known as inflammation) in or around
the joints. These joint problems are caused when the immune system – whose job is
to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs – mistakenly attacks the joints
devorppA
instead.
Patients with RA tend to have a high level of a protein called TNF (stands for tumor
necrosis factor) in their blood, which makes their immune systems more active. If
RA inflammation is left untreated, joints can become loose or stiff, and even
deformed.
Common treatments for RA include medicines that control pain, reduce swelling, and
lower the activity of the immune system. Some patients need more than one
medicine to treat their RA. Doctors may prescribe more than one medicine together,
including:
• Methotrexate (also called “MTX”): A medicine that lowers immune system
activity
• Infliximab (also known as Remicade®): A medicine delivered into the vein
through a needle (called ‘intravenous’ or ‘IV’) that attaches to TNF and keeps
it from activating the immune system
Infliximab is a type of medicine called a “biologic.” Biologics are made of a complex
mix of sugars, proteins, genetic material, living cells, or groups of cells called tissues.
