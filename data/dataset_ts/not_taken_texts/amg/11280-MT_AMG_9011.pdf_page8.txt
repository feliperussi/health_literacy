7. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 11 children and
devorppA
teenagers with SHPT due to CKD. Not all participants in the study had the same results.
The results for any individual participant could have been better or worse than the results
for their group. Other studies may find different results. These results are not an
explanation of what a treatment can and cannot do for an individual. Many studies are
needed to show the benefits and risks of an investigational medicine.
This research may help patients and families in the future by helping doctors understand
more about the safety of etelcalcetide in children and teenagers.
8. Are There Plans for Further Studies?
Additional studies with etelcalcetide in children and teenagers are ongoing.
If more clinical studies are done, they may be listed on public websites, such as those
