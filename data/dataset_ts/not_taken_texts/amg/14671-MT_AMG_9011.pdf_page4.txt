 Diagnosed with certain cancers of the blood or lymph system: multiple
myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; also known as pre-leukemia).
 Cancer was considered relapsed or refractory. Relapsed means participants
had disease that recurred. Refractory means participants had disease that
did not respond to the first treatment.
 Participants not eligible for other treatments known to help with their cancer or
participants cannot take other available treatments known to help with their
cancer.
5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
The medicine tested in this study was AMG 397. AMG 397 may block the activity of
a protein called Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL1). MCL1 causes tumor cells to live
and grow. Blocking MCL1 may stop tumor growth. AMG 397 is given as a tablet
taken by mouth.
This study was planned for 3 parts. Part 1A and Part 1B were completed. No
participants were enrolled in Part 2 or Part 3 because the study ended.
AMG 397 was given in weekly intervals, so participants received treatment once per
day for 2 days, followed by a 5-day break. Participants were given different doses of
AMG 397. The first group of participants received AMG 397 80 milligrams. The next
group of participants could receive a higher dose of AMG 397. Each new group
could get a higher dose until participants experienced medical problems that caused
them to lower their dose or to stop taking AMG 397; then the dose was not raised
any higher.
 In Part 1A, 2 participants received AMG 397 80 mg, 6 participants received
AMG 397 160 mg, and 4 participants received AMG 397 320 mg.
 In Part 1B, 4 participants received AMG 397 80 mg, 5 participants received
AMG 397 160 mg, and 3 participants received AMG 397 320 mg.
