This was an open-label study, which means that the researchers and participants
knew which medicine and dose they received. The study included a 3-week
screening period, a 6-month treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow-up visit
after the last dose of study treatment. Long-term follow-up occurred every 3 months
after end of treatment for up to 1 year.
