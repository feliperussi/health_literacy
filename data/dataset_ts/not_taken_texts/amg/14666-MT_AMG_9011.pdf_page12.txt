doctor as related to treatment. No single clinical study can give a complete picture of

7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
Did participants achieve an IGA score of 0 (clear) or
1 (almost clear; IGA 0/1) at week 16, or a 75% reduction in
EASI (EASI 75) at week 16?
ï‚· There were no statistically significant differences in IGA 0/1 or EASI 75 in
participants at week 16 for any tezepelumab treatment group compared with
placebo. That means that the differences seen could have been due to chance
and not tezepelumab.
