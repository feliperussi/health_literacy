About 1 month after stopping study treatments, participants had a check-up with their
study doctors to see how they were doing after treatment. Other follow-up visits or
phone call check-ups continued every 3 months for up to 2 years.
This study was completed as planned. 284 of the 377 participants completed all their
follow-up visits. 93 participants either chose to stop coming to follow-up visits, lost
contact with the study center, or they passed away prior to their final follow-up.
6. What Were the Side Effects?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called side effects)? devorppA
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen when
you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record side effects that they
believe is possibly caused by the investigational medicine each patient is
receiving. These are also called “adverse reactions.”
What side effects related to the treatment were seen?
A side effect was recorded as “serious” if it caused death, was life threatening, required
the participant to stay in a hospital, or caused a birth defect.
In total, 23 participants passed away due to a medical problem that started during the
study. Study doctors determined that the medical problems in these participants were
not related to Vectibix treatment. 8 of those participants were taking Vectibix and
15 participants had best supportive care only.
