Over the next 30 days, participants visited their study doctors to see how they were
doing after taking etelcalcetide. The study doctors also collected blood samples to learn
more about what happens to etelcalcetide in the body.
5. What Were the Side Effects?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called a side effect)?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen when
you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record all unwanted medical
problems that occur during the study including side effects that they believe are possibly
caused by the investigational medicine each participant is receiving. These are also
devorppA
called “adverse reactions.”
What side effects related to the investigational
medicine were seen?
A side effect was recorded as “serious” if it caused death, was life threatening, required
the participant to stay in a hospital, or the study doctor thought it was clinically important
enough to record as “serious”.
The table below shows how many participants had side effects that were considered
related to treatment.
