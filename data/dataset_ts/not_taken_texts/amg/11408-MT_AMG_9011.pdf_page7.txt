6. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
By week 28, what percentage of participants who took ABP 798
had a response to treatment, compared to participants who took
rituximab?
To answer this question, the study doctors evaluated the participants’ tumors at
screening, week 12, and week 28. They used physical exams and imaging tests to
evaluate the tumors. The study doctors compared the results to see if participants had a
response to treatment.
The study doctors found that:
• 96 out of 123 participants who took ABP 798 (78%, or about 78 out of 100) had a
response to treatment.
• 87 out of 124 participants who took rituximab (70%, or about 70 out of 100) had a
response to treatment.
• The difference between the 2 groups was about 8% (so, about 8% more
participants who took ABP 798 had a response to treatment than participants
who took rituximab).
