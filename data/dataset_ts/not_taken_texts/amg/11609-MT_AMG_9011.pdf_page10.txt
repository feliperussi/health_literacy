7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
How long did participants who took denosumab go without a bone
complication, compared to participants who took zoledronic acid?
 To answer this question, the researchers looked at how long participants who
took each treatment went without a bone complication. For this study, a bone
complication meant a broken bone, the need for surgery or radiation therapy
to the bone, or pressure on the spinal cord.
 The average (median) time from study enrollment to the first occurrence of a
bone complication while participating in the study was 23.98 months for
participants in the zoledronic acid group, and 22.83 months for participants in
the denosumab group.
 This result showed that denosumab was not worse than zoledronic acid at
preventing bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma.
 These results are based on information that was collected until the
researchers had finished gathering the information needed to achieve the
main aim of the study, up to 19 July 2016.
