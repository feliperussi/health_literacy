This was a “phase 3 study,” which is the latest stage for testing investigational medicines
in humans before they are approved for use. This was called an “open-label” study
because all of the participants and study doctors knew what kind of treatment they were
getting.
The main goal of this study was for researchers to learn if adding Vectibix to supportive
care treatments for colorectal cancer could help participants live longer, overall, than
supportive care treatments alone.

161 participants (43%, or about 4 out of 10) were women and 216 participants (57%, or
about 6 out of 10) were men. They ranged in age from 19 to 82 years old.
241 participants (64%, or about 2 out of 3) were younger than 65 years old. The
average age of all participants was about 59 years old.
Participants were examined by a study doctor and chosen to be in the study if they:
• did not have DNA mutations in the KRAS gene
• had at least 1 cancer growth that could be examined in x-ray scans
• could care for themselves and were up and active at least half the time they were
awake
• were already being treated with chemotherapy drugs, but not other anti-tumor
cancer drugs
