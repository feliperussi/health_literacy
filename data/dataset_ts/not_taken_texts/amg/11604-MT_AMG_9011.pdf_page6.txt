Participants also received dexamethasone once per week for the 4-week (40mg)
cycle for Cycles 1 through 9, then for 3 out of 4 weeks each cycle.
Carfilzomib was given as intravenous (in the vein) infusions. This was an open-label
study, which means that both the participants and the study doctors knew which
treatment regimen the participants received.
Participants were checked by the study doctor every 28 days, to see if multiple

receiving study treatment until multiple myeloma worsened, they died, or they started
receiving a different treatment for multiple myeloma.
