 To answer this question, the researchers measured the improvement of
plaque psoriasis using the static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score
to find out how many participants had ‘clear skin’ (ie, no plaques) or ‘almost
clear skin’ (score of 0 or 1) after the first 16-week treatment period.
 In this study, 44% of participants achieved clear or almost clear skin after
16 weeks of treatment with apremilast plus topical therapy.
 These results are based on information that was collected until the
researchers had finished gathering the information needed to achieve the
main aim of the study.
 This study was completed as planned.
 More results may be available at the website listed at the end of this
summary.
8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 152 people
with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Not all participants in the study had the
same results. The results for any single participant could have been better or worse
than the results for their group. Other studies may find different results. These
results do not explain how a medicine may work in a single person. Many studies
are needed to show the benefits and risks of a medicine that is still being tested.
