7. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 256 people with
follicular lymphoma. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results
for any individual participant could have been better or worse than the results for their
group. Other studies may find different results.
This research may help future participants and families by helping doctors understand
more about the treatment being studied. These results are not an explanation of what a
treatment can and cannot do for an individual.
