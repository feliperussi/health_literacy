Why was the study done?
This study was done to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis (also known as “RA”). RA
is a disease that causes pain and swelling (known as inflammation) in or around the
joints. These joint problems are caused when the immune system – whose job is to
attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs – mistakenly attacks the joints
instead.
Patients with RA tend to have a high level of a protein called TNF (stands for tumor
devorppA
necrosis factor) in their blood, which makes their immune systems more active. If RA
inflammation is left untreated, joints can become loose or stiff, and even deformed.
Common treatments for RA include medicines that control pain, reduce swelling, and
lower the activity of the immune system. Some patients need more than one medicine
to treat their RA. Doctors may prescribe more than one medicine together, including:
• Methotrexate (MTX): A medicine that lowers immune system activity
• Adalimumab (HUMIRA®): An injected medicine that attaches to TNF and keeps it
from activating the immune system
Adalimumab is a type of medicine called a “biologic.” Biologics are made of a complex
mix of sugars, proteins, genetic material, living cells, or groups of cells called tissues.
