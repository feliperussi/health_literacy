What study medicine did participants receive?
The participants in the study received either the placebo or 1 of the following investigational
medicines:
• Apremilast
• Lanadelumab-IV
• Zilucoplan.
All of the participants also received the locally available standard of care treatment for
COVID-19 during the study.
Investigators chose these investigational medications because all of them have been shown in
other studies to reduce inflammation. Two of the medicines work to reduce a type of protein,
and 1 reduces production of a type of enzyme. Both these proteins and the enzyme play a role
in inflammation. It was thought these medicines may help people with COVID-19, because they
often will have inflammation in their lungs.
Note: The numbers shown in each results section of this summary may not add up to the
total number of people who participated in the study. This is because not everyone who was
assigned to take one of the investigational medicines or placebos was able to be included
in all of the analyses. For example, some people who were assigned to take a certain
medication did not start taking it. Researchers also combined some people from different
placebo groups together for analysis.
