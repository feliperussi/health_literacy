5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
What investigational medicines were studied?
In this study, ABP 501 was compared with adalimumab. Participants had an equal
chance (50/50) of receiving either of these medicines as their study treatment.
Neither the participants nor the study doctors could choose which treatment participants
were given. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment group by chance
(“randomized”) using an automated computer system. This is like flipping a coin or
drawing numbers out of a hat.
This was a “double-blinded” study, which means that the participants and the study
doctors could only find out whether the participant was given ABP 501 or adalimumab
