8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 595 people
with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Not all participants in the study had the
same results. The results for any single participant could have been better or worse
than the results for their group. Other studies may find different results. These
results do not explain how a medicine may work in a single person. Many studies
are needed to show the benefits and risks of a medicine that is still being tested.
This research may help future participants and families by helping doctors
understand more about the treatment being studied.
