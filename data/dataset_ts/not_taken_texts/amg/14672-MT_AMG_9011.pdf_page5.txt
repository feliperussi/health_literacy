5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
Blinatumomab and standard chemotherapy were the medicines evaluated in the
TOWER study, but participants did not receive any medicine in this study or come to
any study visits. Instead, researchers contacted the participants and/or their families
who were alive at the end of the TOWER study, and checked their medical charts.
The researchers asked whether the participants were still alive, and for participants
who received chemotherapy in the TOWER study, whether they had taken
blinatumomab after the TOWER study ended.
6. What Were the Side Effects?
All medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may
happen when you take a medicine. During the TOWER study, researchers collected
information on and reported all the medical problems participants had. For this
study, researchers only collected specific information on whether participants were
still alive, and for the participants who received chemotherapy in the TOWER study,
whether they had taken blinatumomab after the TOWER study ended, so additional
information on medical problems was not reported.
7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
Did participants who received blinatumomab in the TOWER
study live longer than participants who received standard
chemotherapy in the TOWER study?
 This study found that half of the participants who received standard
chemotherapy in the TOWER study lived at least 4 months. Half of the
participants who received blinatumomab in the TOWER study lived at least
7.6 months.
 A total of 12 out of 134 participants (9%, or about 9 out of 100) who received
standard chemotherapy during the TOWER study switched to blinatumomab.
