Apremilast works by blocking an enzyme in the body called phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4) that is usually increased in medical conditions involving inflammation, such
as the reddening and itching of the skin in psoriasis. Apremilast is available in the
form of tablets and is taken by mouth. Apremilast has been approved for the
treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
This was a phase 3 study, the late stage of the development process of medicines
for humans. Researchers compared the study medicine, apremilast, to a placebo. A
placebo does not contain any medicine and helps researchers compare the effects
of a study medicine to taking no medicine. The main purpose of this study was to
find out if participants who took apremilast saw an improvement in their mild to
moderate plaque psoriasis compared to participants who took placebo.
