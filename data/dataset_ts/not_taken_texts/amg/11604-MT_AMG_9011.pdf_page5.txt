Participants were examined by a study doctor and chosen to be in the study if they
met certain study requirements. Some of the key requirements included that they:
 were 18 years of age or older
 were diagnosed with multiple myeloma that came back after treatment or that
no longer responded to treatment
 had received 2 or 3 treatments for multiple myeloma before entering the
study, including a type of medicine that may work on the immune system to
slow the growth of cancer cells (immunomodulatory agent), and a type of
medicine that may prevent the breakdown of abnormal proteins in cancer
cells, causing these cells to die (proteasome inhibitor)
 had multiple myeloma that could be accurately measured by the study doctor
5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
Participants in this study had an equal chance of receiving either once-weekly or
twice-weekly treatment. Neither the participants nor the study doctors could choose
which treatment participants were given. Participants agreed to be put into a
treatment group by chance (“randomized”) using an automated computer system.
This is like flipping a coin or drawing numbers out of a hat.
Participants in both groups received carfilzomib and dexamethasone. Each dosing
cycle was 28 days (4 weeks).
In the once-weekly dosing group, participants received high-dose carfilzomib
(70 mg/m2) once per week for 3 out of the 4 weeks of each cycle, at the clinic.
Participants also received dexamethasone once per week (40 mg) for the 4-week
cycle for Cycles 1 through 9, then for 3 out of 4 weeks of each cycle.
In the twice-weekly dosing group, participants received low-dose carfilzomib
(27 mg/m2) twice per week for 3 out of the 4 weeks each cycle, at the clinic.
