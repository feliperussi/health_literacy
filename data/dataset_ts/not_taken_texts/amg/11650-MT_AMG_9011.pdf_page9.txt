7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
Did participants who took apremilast see their plaque
psoriasis improve, compared to participants who took
placebo?
 To answer this question, the researchers measured the improvement of
plaque psoriasis using the static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score
to find out how many participants had their plaque psoriasis improve by at
least 2 points from the start of the study to ‘clear skin’ (ie, no plaques) or
‘almost clear skin’ (score of 0 or 1) after the 16-week double-blind part of the
study.
 In this study, 22% of participants in the apremilast group and 4% of
participants in the placebo group saw an improvement in their plaque
psoriasis of at least 2 points by the end of the double-blind part of the study,
as shown in the graph below.
 This result showed that apremilast was more effective than placebo at treating
participants with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.
 These results are based on information that was collected until the
researchers had finished gathering the information needed to achieve the
main aim of the study.
 These results were not likely due to chance.
 This study was completed as planned.
 More results may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.
