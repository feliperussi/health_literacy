How long were participants in the study before the study ended?
Participants were treated in the study for about one year.
Did tezepelumab relieve signs of AD more than placebo?
There were no statistically significant differences in IGA 0/1 or EASI 75 in
participants at Week 16 for any tezepelumab treatment group compared with
placebo. The differences seen may be due to chance. The table below shows the
number and percentage (%) of participants who reached an IGA score of 0 (clear) or
1 (almost clear) and EASI 75 (at least a 75% reduction in the EASI score from the
beginning of the study).
