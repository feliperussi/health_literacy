3. General Information About the Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
 This study took place in 18 countries.
 The study began in December 2019 and ended in September 2020.
 The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
Blinatumomab is an immunotherapy medicine that is used to treat people with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of cancer of the white blood cells.
Blinatumomab helps the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells.
This study included people with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had participated
in a previous study called the TOWER study (00103311). The Philadelphia
chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is sometimes found in the leukemia
cells. Participants in the TOWER study did not have the Philadelphia chromosome.
Additionally, participants in the TOWER study had ALL that either did not improve
with treatment, or that had returned after initially improving with treatment.
Participants received either standard chemotherapy treatment or blinatumomab
during the TOWER study.
This was a phase 4 study, which is an additional study done after a medicine has
been approved by a government health authority for doctors to prescribe to patients.
TOWER study was closed early because the main purpose of the study was met, so
this study was done as part of the process required for continuous approval of
