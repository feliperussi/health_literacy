5. What Were the Side Effects?
What is an adverse reaction (sometimes called a side effect)?
A lot of research is needed to know whether a medicine causes a side effect. All
medicines can cause side effects, or unwanted medical problems that may happen when
you take a medicine. In a clinical study, the study doctors record all unwanted medical
problems that occur during the study including side effects that they believe are possibly
caused by the investigational medicine each participant is receiving. These are also
called “adverse reactions.”
What side effects related to the investigational
medicine were seen?
When reporting side effects in this study, the study doctor did not know which treatment
a participant was receiving. A side effect was recorded as “serious” if it caused death,
was life threatening, required the participant to stay in a hospital, or the study doctor
thought it was clinically important enough to record as “serious”. No participant in this
study died due to a side effect.
