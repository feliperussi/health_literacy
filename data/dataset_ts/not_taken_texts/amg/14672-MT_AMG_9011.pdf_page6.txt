8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 75 people
with ALL. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results for any
single participant could have been better or worse than the results for their group.
Other studies may find different results. These results do not explain how a
medicine may work in a single person. Many studies are needed to show the
benefits and risks of a medicine that is still being tested. This research may help
future participants and families by helping doctors understand more about the
treatment being studied.
