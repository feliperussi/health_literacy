2. General Information About The Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
 This study took place at 124 centers in Europe, Latin America, North America, and South
Africa.
 The study began in March 2015 and ended in July 2018.
 The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
This study was done to help patients with a condition called psoriatic arthritis (also known as
“PsA”). PsA can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in or around the joints. This type of
arthritis often happens in people with psoriasis. Psoriasis is a condition that causes itchy,
red patches with silvery scales on the skin.
PsA is caused when the immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses
and other germs, mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body instead.

Common treatments for PsA include pain control and medicines that lower the activity of the
immune system. Some patients need more than one medicine to treat their PsA. Doctors
may prescribe more than one medicine together.
Methotrexate (or MTX) is a medicine commonly used to treat PsA because it lowers immune
system activity. Some patients still have PsA symptoms while taking MTX. Etanercept (also
called Enbrel) is a medicine approved by the government health agencies in some countries
to treat PsA. When used in studies like this one, it is called an “investigational medicine.”
This was a phase 3 study, the late stage of the development process of medicines for
humans. This study included investigational medicines and a “placebo.” A placebo does not
contain any medicine and helps researchers compare the effects of a new medicine to taking
no medicine.
The main purpose of the study was to compare PsA symptom improvement in participants
who were given one of the following treatment combinations for 24 weeks:
 Etanercept injection + placebo pills
 Etanercept injection + MTX pills
 Placebo injection + MTX pills
