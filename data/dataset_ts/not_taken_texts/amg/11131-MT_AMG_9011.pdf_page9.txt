Clinical Study Results
Treatments that work on the immune system (like ABP 710 and infliximab) are
known to cause certain types of side effects. In this study, researchers looked at all
the side effects that are known to be associated with treatments such as infliximab or
ABP 710. These types of side effects (listed below) were found to be similar in all
treatment groups. No participants reported some other known side effects such as,
new or worsening liver infection called Hepatitis B, or diseases caused when the
brain or spinal cord are mistakenly attacked by the immune system.
• Allergic reaction
• Abnormal numbers of blood cells
• Liver problems
• Cancers
• Infections that happen because of a weakened immune system, including
serious infections
• Heart or blood vessel problems that cause swelling in the body
• Other diseases where the immune system attacks healthy cells

7. WHAT WERE THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE STUDY?
How did participants’ RA symptoms improve after 22 weeks of
treatment with ABP 710 compared with infliximab?
In this study, researchers looked at the RA symptoms of participants after 22 weeks
of treatment with ABP 710 or infliximab. Researchers used a scale called the ACR
score (which stands for the American College of Rheumatology). The ACR score is
used to measure the amount of improvement people have when being treated for
RA. The ACR score counts the number of swollen and tender joints, plus:
• how the participants feel they are doing,
• how their doctors feel they are doing,
• how much pain the participants are in,
• how much the RA symptoms keep participants from doing every day
activities, and
• laboratory tests that measure inflammation.
A score of ACR20 was used in this study. To reach that score, a participant had to
have at least 20% (or 1 in 5) of his or her joints show improvement after 22 weeks of
