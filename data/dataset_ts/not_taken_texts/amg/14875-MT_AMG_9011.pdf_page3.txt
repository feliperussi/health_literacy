Why was the research needed?
Many people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and fever, and get
better quickly. In some people, however, symptoms are more severe, and they need to be cared
for in a hospital. Some people may even die.
Because there were only a few medications accepted to treat people with COVID-19 at the time
that the study took place, it was important to find more options.
