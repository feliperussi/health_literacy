When participants came to study visits, their doctors did certain lab tests. The
researchers looked for changes in these lab tests to learn more about the safety of
etelcalcetide. The lab test changes that happened during this study were the same
changes that typically happen in patients with CKD and SHPT.
At study visits, doctors measured the participants’ vital signs, including body weight,
body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. They also did a test called an
electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the activity of the heart. The researchers
looked for changes in vital signs and ECGs to learn more about the safety of
etelcalcetide.
No important changes in vital signs happened during this study. One participant had an
important change in ECG results, but did not have any medical problems associated with
this change.
