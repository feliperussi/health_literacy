What side effects related to the treatment were seen?
When reporting side effects in this study, the study doctor did not know which treatment
a participant was receiving. A side effect was recorded as “serious” if it caused death,
was life threatening, required the participant to stay in a hospital, or caused a birth
defect. In this study, no participants died due to a side effect.
The table below shows how many participants had side effects that were considered
