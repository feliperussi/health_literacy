 Participants in this study had PPP and had previously been treated with topical
(medicine applied to the skin) steroids and/or vitamin D3 preparations with an
unsatisfactory response.
 Apremilast works by blocking an enzyme in the body called phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4) that is usually increased in medical conditions involving inflammation,
such as at skin. Apremilast is in the form of tablets and is taken by mouth.
 This was a phase 2 study, the second part of the development of medicines for
humans. Researchers wanted to learn if this new study medicine could help
participants with PPP. Researchers compared the study medicine, apremilast, to
a placebo. A placebo does not contain any medicine and helps researchers
compare the effects of a study medicine to taking no medicine. The main
purpose of this study was to find out if participants who took apremilast saw an
improvement in their PPP compared to participants who took placebo.
