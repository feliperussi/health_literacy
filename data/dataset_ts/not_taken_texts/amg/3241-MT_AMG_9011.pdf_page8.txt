compared the “median” length of time for each treatment group. The median is the
number in the middle of the list, with equal amounts above and below this number.
The results in the figure below show the median length of time participants survived in
each treatment group. Participants treated with Vectibix plus best supportive care had a
median overall survival of 10.0 months. Participants treated with best supportive care
alone had a median overall survival of 7.4 months. Researchers determined that this
time difference is significant and not likely due to chance.

8. How Has This Study Helped Patients and Researchers?
What is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 377 people with
metastatic colorectal cancer. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The
results for any individual participant could have been better or worse than the results for
their group. These results are not an explanation of what a treatment can and cannot do
for an individual. No single clinical study can give a complete picture of the benefits and
risks of a medicine. Other studies may find different results.
This research may help future cancer patients and their families by helping doctors
understand more about how Vectibix may improve patients’ survival.
