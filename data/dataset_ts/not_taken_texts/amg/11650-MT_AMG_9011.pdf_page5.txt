 had not had success in treating their plaque psoriasis with at least one topical
therapy.
5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
In this study, apremilast was compared to placebo. Participants had an equal
chance of receiving either apremilast or a placebo. This study had 2 parts: a 16-
week double-blind part, followed by a 16-week open-label part.
In the double-blind part of the study, neither the participants nor the study doctor
could choose the medicine the participants received. Participants agreed to be put
into a medicine group by chance (“randomized”). This is like flipping a coin or
drawing numbers out of a hat.
During the double-blind part of the study, neither the participants nor the doctors
knew which medicine each participant was given until after the study was over. This
was done to make sure the study results were not influenced in any way. This was
known as the double-blind part of the study. Each participant took either 30 mg
apremilast or placebo twice a day for 16 weeks.
At the end of 16 weeks, the participants had their plaque psoriasis evaluated by their
doctors. Participants could then choose to continue with the study with open-label
30 mg apremilast twice a day for another 16 weeks as shown in the graphic below.
Open-label means that both the participants and the study doctors knew what
medicine the participants received. The information collected from all subjects at the
end of the 16 weeks gave the researchers the information needed to decide if the
main aim of the study was met.
