Apremilast works by blocking an enzyme in the body called phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4) that is usually increased in medical conditions involving inflammation, such
as the reddening and itching of the skin in psoriasis. Apremilast is available in the
form of tablets and is taken by mouth. Apremilast has been approved for the
treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
This was a phase 3 study, the late stage of the development process of medicines
for humans. The main purpose of this study was to find out if participants with mild
to moderate plaque psoriasis who took apremilast plus topical therapy (medicines
applied to the skin) would achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of
treatment.
