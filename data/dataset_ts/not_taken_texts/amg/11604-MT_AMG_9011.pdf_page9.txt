7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
How long did participants who received once-weekly
carfilzomib plus dexamethasone survive without multiple
myeloma getting worse, compared to participants who
received twice-weekly carfilzomib plus dexamethasone?
 To answer this question, the researchers looked at progression-free survival.
The median progression free survival is estimated as the length of time that
half of the participants are expected to survive without their multiple myeloma
getting worse.
 In the once-weekly carfilzomib plus dexamethasone group, median
progression-free survival was 11.2 months.
 In the twice-weekly carfilzomib plus dexamethasone group, median
progression-free survival was 7.6 months.
 These results were not likely due to chance.
 This study was completed as planned.
 More results may be available at the websites listed at the end of this
summary.
8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
Amgen would like to thank everyone who participated in this study. These results
are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 478 people with multiple
myeloma. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results for any
single participant could have been better or worse than the results for their group.
Other studies may find different results. These results do not explain how a
treatment may work in a single person. This research may help future participants
