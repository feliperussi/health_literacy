How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This summary shows only the main results from this study. Other studies may provide new
information or different results. Because this study ended early, the number of participants in
each study medicine group was smaller than originally expected. Therefore, the only conclusion
that could be drawn was that apremilast did not help people with COVID-19 as much as
expected. No formal conclusions should be drawn from the other results of the study.
The findings from this study may be used to make decisions about further research that may
be needed to learn more about COVID-19 and possible treatments.
