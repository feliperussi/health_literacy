Researchers also used a calculation called “risk ratio” to compare the results of the
2 treatment groups. The closer a risk ratio is to 1, the more alike the treatments are. In
this study:
ABP 501 vs. Adalimumab Risk Ratio = 1.039
Researchers studied these findings. Based on the above results, they determined that
ABP 501 worked the same as adalimumab in this study.
These are just some of the main results of the study. More results may be available at
the websites listed at the end of this summary.
8. How Has This Study Helped Patients and Researchers?
What is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 526 people with
RA. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results for any individual
devorppA
participant could have been better or worse than the results for their group. These
results are not an explanation of what a treatment can and cannot do for an individual.
No single clinical study can give a complete picture of the benefits and risks of a
medicine. Other studies may find different results.
This research may help future patients and their families by helping doctors understand
more about the treatment being studied.
9. Are There Plans for Further Studies?
