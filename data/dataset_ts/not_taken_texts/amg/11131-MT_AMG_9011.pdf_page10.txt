How Did ABP 710 Compare to Infliximab in Improving Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?
treatment. The participant also had to be doing or feeling at least 20% better in 3 of
the 5 other categories listed above.
The results in the figure below show the percentage of participants in each group
who reached an ACR20 score 22 weeks after starting treatment. 68% of participants
in the ABP 710 group and 59% of participants in the infliximab group showed at least
a 20% improvement in their RA symptoms after 22 weeks.

Researchers reviewed the results from both treatment groups. Researchers
predicted that the results would be very similar between the ABP 710 and infliximab
groups. The difference in this study, 9% higher for ABP 710, was a slightly higher
response rate than predicted.
Other measurements showing similarity between ABP 710 and infliximab are
available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.
8. HOW HAS THIS STUDY HELPED PATIENTS AND RESEARCHERS?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 558 people
with RA. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results for any
individual participant could have been better or worse than the results for his or her
group. Other studies may find different results.
This research may help future patients and their families by helping doctors
understand more about the treatment being studied. These results are not an
explanation of what a treatment can and cannot do for an individual.
