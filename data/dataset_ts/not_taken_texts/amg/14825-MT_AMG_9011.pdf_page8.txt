7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
Did participants who took apremilast see their PPP improve, compared
to participants who took placebo?
ï‚· To answer this question, the researchers measured the improvement of PPP
using the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) total
score to find out how many participants achieved PPPASI-50 response which
is 50% or greater improvement of PPPASI score from starting the study.
o The PPPASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity
and area of PPP lesions and their response to therapy. Each of the
palms and soles are assessed separately for both the area involved
and severity of the lesions and given a number value. A calculation is
then used to get a total score.
