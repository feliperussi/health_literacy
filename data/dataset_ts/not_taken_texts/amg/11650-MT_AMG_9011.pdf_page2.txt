Why was the study done?
Plaque psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition that causes “plaques”, raised red
patches covered with dead skin cells that appear white. These plaques can be itchy
and painful. Plaque psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakes normal
cells in the body as unwanted invaders and attacks these cells. Depending on how
bad the condition is, on how many and how big the plaques a person has, this
condition can be mild, moderate, or severe. Participants in this study had mild to
moderate plaque psoriasis as determined by their doctor.
