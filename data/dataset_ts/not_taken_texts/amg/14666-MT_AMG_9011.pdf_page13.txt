 The first part of the study (Part A) was stopped earlier than planned because
there was no difference between the response in participants in the tezepelumab
groups and placebo group.
 Part B, the part of the study studying tezepelumab combined with a topical
corticosteroid regimen, was not started.
 Plans were made to manage the study during the coronavirus disease in 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. These plans were started on April 6, 2020 and included
other visits (phone calls, video conferences, and alternative sites when subjects
could not enter the hospital), temporary stopping of investigational drug for
subjects showing COVID-19 symptoms, and use of other laboratories or data
processing.
