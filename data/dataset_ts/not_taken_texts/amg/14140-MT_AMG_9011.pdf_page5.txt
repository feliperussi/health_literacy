This study had 4 parts: a 4-week screening period, a 16-week treatment period
during which participants used both apremilast and their topical therapy, a second
16-week treatment period during which participants continued taking apremilast but
were able to stop their topical therapy, and a 4-week follow-up period. This was an
open-label study, which means that both the participants and the study doctors knew
what medicines the participants received.
