3. General Information About the Clinical Study
Where and when was the study done?
 This study took place in Japan.
 The study began in October 2019 and ended in June 2021.
 The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
 Palmopustular pustulosois (PPP) is a disease in which developing small blisters,
pustules, and redness, along with peeling of the upper layers of skin appear on
the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. In the pustules, there are no
disease-causing microbes such as bacteria and viruses, and these are called
sterile pustules. When the pustules first appear there may be itching, and after a
while the pustules dry out and become a brownish scab or crust and peel off.
The skin around this area is inflamed and reddened. Pustules often come out
one after the other and in some cases repeat becoming better or worse.
