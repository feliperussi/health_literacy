Carfilzomib (KyprolisÂ®) is a type of treatment known as a proteasome inhibitor.
Carfilzomib is currently approved in some countries for the treatment of adults with
multiple myeloma that comes back after treatment or that no longer responds to
treatment. Carfilzomib may prevent the breakdown of abnormal proteins in cells,
causing these cells to die. Cancer cells are more sensitive to these effects than
normal cells.
Carfilzomib is given in combination with other medicines that are approved for
multiple myeloma, such as dexamethasone (a corticosteroid medicine).
This was a phase 3 study, the late stage of the development process of medicines
for humans before they are approved for general use and after the medicines have
been tested for safety and effectiveness in earlier phases. The main purpose of this
study was to find out whether a once-weekly higher dose of an anti-myeloma
medicine, called carfilzomib, works better than a twice-weekly lower dose.
4. Who Was Included in This Study?
Who took part in the study?
This study included 478 participants with multiple myeloma. 260 participants (54%,
or about 54 out of 100) were men and 218 participants (46%, or about 46 out of 100)
were women. They ranged in age from 35 to 85 years. 208 participants (44%, or
about 44 out of 100) were younger than 65 years old, and 270 participants (56%, or
about 56 out 100) were 65 and older.
