Treatments that work on the immune system (like ABP 501 and adalimumab) are known
to cause certain side effects. Researchers looked at all the “known” side effects in this
study and found they were similar in both treatment groups.
This section only shows the most frequently reported side effects. Information about
other side effects may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.
7. What Were the Overall Results of the Study?
How did participants’ RA symptoms improve after 24 weeks of treatment with
ABP 501 compared with adalimumab?
In this study, researchers looked at the RA symptoms of participants after 24 weeks of
treatment with ABP 501 or adalimumab. Researchers used a scale called the ACR
score (which stands for the American College of Rheumatology). The ACR score is
used to measure the amount of improvement people have when being treated for RA.
The ACR score counts the number of swollen and tender joints, plus:
devorppA
• how the participants feel they are doing,
• how their doctors feel they are doing,
• how much pain the participants are in,
• how much the RA symptoms keep participants from doing every day activities,
and
• laboratory tests that measure inflammation.
A score of ACR20 was used in this study. To reach that score, a participant had to have
20% (or 1 in 5) of their joints show improvement after 24 weeks of treatment. The
participant also had to be doing or feeling 20% better in 3 of the 5 other categories listed
above.
The results in the figure below show the percentage of participants in each group who
reached an ACR20 score 24 weeks after starting treatment. 75% of participants in the
ABP 501 group and 72% of participants in the adalimumab group showed a 20%
improvement in their RA symptoms after 24 weeks.
