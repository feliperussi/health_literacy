3. General Information About the Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
• This study took place in China, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Croatia,
Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and
Mexico.
• The study began in November 2011 and ended in November 2016.
• The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers for both men and women around
the world. More than 1.2 million new patients are found to have colorectal cancer every
year. If cancer spreads to other places in the body besides the colon or rectum, it is
called “metastatic” colorectal cancer.
Researchers are testing new medicines to fight cancer caused by gene mutations:
• Material inside the cells of all living things
• Contains the code for features, like how things look, work, grow, or
DNA:
multiply
devorppA
Gene: • A part or unit of DNA with the instructions for one feature
• Change in the DNA code of a gene
• Some gene mutations can make cells multiply out of control, and
Mutation: help cancer grow or spread
• Other gene mutations may keep some cancer treatments from
working
• A gene that is mutated in some patients with cancer
KRAS: • KRAS mutations may keep some colorectal cancer treatments from
working
Some cancer treatments work best when there is no mutation in the DNA.
Vectibix (panitumumab) is a cancer-fighting medicine that can block the messages that
tell cancer cells to multiply. Vectibix does not seem to work for patients with KRAS gene
mutations, so doctors will order DNA testing before prescribing it for treatment.
Vectibix is approved by the health agencies in many countries to treat metastatic
colorectal cancer. When used in studies like this one, it is called an “investigational
medicine.”
