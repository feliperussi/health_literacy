7. How Has This Study Helped Participants And Researchers?
What is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 851 people with
PsA. Not all participants in the study had the same results. The results for any individual
participant could have been better or worse than the results for their group. Other studies
may find different results. These results are not an explanation of what a treatment can and
cannot do for an individual. Many studies are needed to show the benefits and risks of an
investigational medicine. This research may help future participants and families by helping
doctors understand more about the treatments being studied.
