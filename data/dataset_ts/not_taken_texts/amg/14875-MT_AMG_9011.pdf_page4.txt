What was the purpose of the study?
In this study, researchers wanted to know:
• W hether the investigational medications may be used as a potential treatment option
when given with the “standard of care”. Standard of care is the care that patients would
normally receive if they were not in this study
• W hether the investigational medications worked and how safe they were
• T he effects of each investigational medication on COVID-19.
The researchers compared each investigational medication (apremilast, lanadelumab-IV, and
zilucoplan) with a placebo.
Researchers used a placebo to learn if the study results were due to 1 of the investigational
medications, or if the results could be due to some other reason.
All participants also received the usual treatments and care for COVID-19, according to local
clinical practice (standard of care).
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer for each of the 3 investigational
medications when compared with a placebo were:
• W as the time it took for people in the hospital to recover from COVID-19 affected?
• W as the number of people who showed improvement or who were well enough to leave
the hospital affected?
• W as the number of people who had improved, who had been released from the hospital,
and who no longer needed extra oxygen affected?
• W as the number of people who died affected?
• W hat adverse reactions (unwanted health problems) happened during the study?
About the study design
• This study was a double-blinded study.
– This means that none of the participants, the study doctor, or the study
staff knew which study medicine (either the investigational medications
or the placebo) each participant received.
• Some studies are “blinded” because knowing what study medicine the
participants are receiving can affect the results of the study.
• However, when Amgen and its industry partners looked at the results at
the end of the study, they needed to find out which study medicine each
participant received to analyze the study results.
• The researchers used a computer program to help randomly choose the study
medicine each participant received according to study eligibility criteria. This
method is intended to make sure the comparison between the groups is fair
and is as accurate as possible.
