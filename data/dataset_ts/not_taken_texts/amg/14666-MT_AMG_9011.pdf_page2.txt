3. General Information About the Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
 This study had 2 planned parts, which included the first part of the study
evaluating the safety and efficacy of tezepelumab alone (part A) and a study
evaluating tezepelumab combined with a topical corticosteroid (part B).
 This study took place in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany,
Hungary, Japan, Latvia, Poland, Republic of Korea, Spain, Ukraine, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.
 The study began in March 2019 and ended in December 2020.
 The first part of the study (Part A) was stopped earlier than planned because
there was no difference in the response of tezepelumab and the response of
placebo. The results may be due to chance and not tezepelumab. A placebo
does not contain any medicine and helps researchers compare the effects of an
investigational medicine to a placebo. Part B of the study was not started.
