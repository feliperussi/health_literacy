Clinical Study Results
Participants were examined by a study doctor and chosen to be in the study if they:
• were 18 years of age or older
• were diagnosed with follicular lymphoma that involves more than one lymph node
region
• were considered to have a low tumor burden (low amount of cancer cells in the
body)
• had follicular lymphoma that was considered to be mildly aggressive (tumors
grow at a slower rate)
4. Which Medicines Were Studied?
In this study, ABP 798 was compared with rituximab. Participants had an equal chance
of receiving either treatment.
Neither the participants nor the study doctors could choose which treatment participants
were given. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment group by chance
devorppA
(“randomized”) using an automated computer system. This is like flipping a coin or
drawing numbers out of a hat.
This was a “double-blinded” study, which means that the participants and the study
doctors could only find out which treatment the participant was given after the entire
study was completed. This was done to make sure the study conduct and results were
not influenced in any way.
ABP 798 or rituximab were given as intravenous (in the vein) infusions. The ABP 798
dose was 375 mg/m2 (milligrams per body surface area) and the rituximab dose was
375 mg/m2. Treatment was given once weekly for 4 weeks, and then at week 12 and
week 20. Tumors were evaluated at screening, and then again at week 12 and week 28.
Week 28 was considered the end of the study.
