Clinical Study Results
2. General Information About the Clinical Trial
Where and when was the study done?
• This study took place in 20 countries.
• The study began in May 2016 and ended in June 2019.
• The study was completed as planned.
Why was the study done?
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is cancer that begins in the lymphocytes, which are a
type of white blood cell. White blood cells are part of the body’s immune system. There
are many types of NHL, but they all have similar characteristics. Patients with NHL may
have swollen/enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, groin, or underarms. They may also
devorppA
feel very tired and have stomach or chest pain, fever, and night sweats.
Common treatments for NHL include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and antibody
therapy. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system. Antibody therapies use
antibodies that are made in a lab to help fight cancer.
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a type of antibody therapy that is currently approved
in some countries for the treatment of NHL in adults. Rituximab may help the immune
system to destroy cancer cells, and may also destroy cancer cells on its own.
Rituximab is also known as a biologic medicine, which is a medicine that contains one or
more active substances that are made by or come from living organisms.
ABP 798 is another IV biologic medicine. It was created to be highly similar to rituximab.
Once a new biologic product has been tested and is shown to be highly similar to a
reference biologic product, it is called a “biosimilar.” In clinical studies like this one, ABP
798 is called an investigational medicine, and rituximab is called the reference product.
This was a phase 3 study, the late stage of the development process of medicines for
humans. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ABP 798
with rituximab in adults with a type of NHL called CD20 Positive B-cell NHL (follicular
lymphoma).
