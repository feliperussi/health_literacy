In this study, researchers wanted to determine the optimal dose of AMG 397 to test
in future studies. One way to determine this optimal dose is for researchers to look
at the number of participants who had “dose-limiting toxicities” (DLTs) at each
different dose level that was tested in the study. A DLT is a side effect that is related
to the treatment and that causes the participant to lower their dose or to stop taking
the medicine altogether.
 In Part 1A, 1 participant had 2 DLTs (increase in enzyme found in muscles
and heart that could indicate muscle damage, and increase in enzyme found
in muscles and heart that could indicate heart injury). This participant
received AMG 397 320 mg. No participants had DLTs at the other dose
levels.
 In Part 1B, 2 participants had a DLT. One participant had an increased liver
enzyme that could indicate liver damage, and one participant had an increase
in enzyme found in muscles and heart that could indicate heart injury. These
participants received AMG 397 320 mg. No participants had DLTs at the other
dose levels.

8. How Has This Study Helped Participants and Researchers?
What else is important to know about these results?
These results are only for this clinical study, which looked at a sample of 24 people
with relapsed or refractory MM, NHL, AML, or MDS. These results add to the
understanding of the study drug. Not all participants in each part of the study had
the same results. The results for any single participant could have been better or
worse than the results for their group. Other studies may find different results.
These results do not explain how a treatment may work in a single person. Many
studies are needed to show the benefits and risks of a medicine. This research may
help future participants and families by helping doctors understand more about the
treatment being studied.
