5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
The medication in this study was tezepelumab. Tezepelumab is a type of antibody.
That means it is a copy of a protein produced by white blood cells that helps fight
disease or infection. Tezepelumab was developed in a lab. It was previously
studied in patients with AD and showed improvements in patients with AD.
Tezepelumab has shown in previous studies that it blocks a protein called thymic
stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP). TSLP causes skin itching and inflammation and is
increased in AD.
Participants were given one of the following study medications:
 Tezepelumab 420 mg subcutaneous (SC; under the skin) every 2 weeks
(Q2W)
 Tezepelumab 280 mg SC Q2W
 Tezepelumab 210 mg SC every 4 weeks (Q4W)
 Placebo SC Q2W
In Part A, some participants did not respond to tezepelumab and were referred to as
non-responders. Non-responders did not achieve at least a 50% improvement in the
EASI score at week 16 compared to baseline (day 1). Non-responders then received
study drug tezepelumab 420 mg SC Q2W for the remainder of the study, beginning
with the week 18 dose.
