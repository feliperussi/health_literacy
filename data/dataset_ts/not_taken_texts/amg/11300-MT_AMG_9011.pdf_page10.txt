6. What Were The Overall Results Of The Study?
How did participants’ symptoms improve after 24 weeks of
treatment?
In this study, researchers looked at the PsA symptoms of participants after their first
24 weeks of treatment with etanercept, MTX, or both. Researchers used several methods to
evaluate PsA symptoms, including a scale called the ACR score (which stands for the
American College of Rheumatology). The ACR score is used to measure the amount of
improvement people have when being treated for PsA.
The ACR score counts the number of swollen and tender joints, plus:
 how the participants feel they are doing
 how their doctors feel they are doing
 how much pain the participants are in
 how much the PsA symptoms keep participants from doing every day activities
 laboratory tests that measure inflammation

A score of ACR20 was used in this study. To reach that score, a participant had to have at
least 20% (or 1 in 5) of his or her joints show improvement after 24 weeks of treatment. The
participant also had to be doing or feeling at least 20% better in 3 of the other 5 categories
listed above.
The results of this study included:
 65% (184 out of 283 participants) in the etanercept + MTX group showed
improvement in their PsA symptoms after 24 weeks of treatment
 51% (144 out of 284 participants) in the MTX + placebo group showed improvement
in their PsA symptoms after 24 weeks of treatment
 61% (173 out of 284 participants) in the eteranercept + placebo group showed
improvement in their PSA symptoms after 21 weeks of treatment
The results in the figure below shows the percentage of participants in each group who
reached an ACR20 score 24 weeks after starting treatment.
