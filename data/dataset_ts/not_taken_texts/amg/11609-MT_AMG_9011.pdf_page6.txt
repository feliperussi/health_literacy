5. Which Medicines Were Studied?
In this study, denosumab was compared to zoledronic acid. Participants had an
equal chance of receiving either treatment.
Neither the participants nor the study doctors could choose which treatment
participants were given. Participants agreed to be put into a treatment group by
chance (“randomized”) using an automated computer system. This is like flipping a
coin or drawing numbers out of a hat.
During the first part of the study, neither the participants nor the doctors knew which
treatment each participant was given until after the study was over. This was done
to make sure the study results were not influenced in any way. This was known as
the double-blinded part of the study. Each participant would receive one of the
following combinations every 4 weeks:
 An injection of denosumab 120 milligrams, and an IV infusion of placebo
or
 An injection of placebo and an IV infusion of zoledronic acid 4 milligrams
A placebo does not contain any medicine but looks like the study medicine.
Participants also received standard treatment for multiple myeloma.
Participants were checked by the study doctor every 4 weeks. Participants were
expected to continue receiving study treatment until about 676 participants had at
least 1 bone complication during the study, and the researchers had finished
gathering the information needed to achieve the main aim of the study. Based on a
review of the data collected during this part of the study, participants who were still
on double-blinded treatment at this time were then offered to switch to open-label
denosumab for up to 2 years. Open-label means that both the participants and the
study doctors knew what treatment the participants received.
