General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in January 2018 and ended in January 2019.
What was the main reason for this study?
Asthma is a long-term condition of the airways. When the airways are swollen and
inflamed, they become narrow. This narrowing can cause coughing, wheezing, chest
tightness and shortness of breath.
For patients with asthma, inhalers are an important part of treatment. An inhaler is a
handheld device that delivers medicine(s) to the lungs. For any treatment to work well,
patients must take it as directed by their doctor. This is called adherence. Due to the
