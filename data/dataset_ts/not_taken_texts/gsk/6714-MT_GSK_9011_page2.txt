Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are a class of anti-viral medicines that are used to treat
chronic hepatitis B. They work by controlling the amount of virus in the body. Doctors
can monitor the amount of HBV in the body by measuring the HBV DNA levels in blood.
Nucleos(t)ide analogues are considered not to be working well if a patient’s HBV DNA
level remains greater than 200 international units per millilitre (IU/mL).
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a type of NA. In this study, researchers wanted to
see how well TDF works in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B who did not
respond well to treatment with multiple NAs. They also studied the safety of TDF.
Which medicine was studied?
Patients took TDF (300 milligrams) tablet once daily for 144 weeks. The patients knew
which treatment they received. This is called an open-label study.
Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women were included in the study if they:
• Were between 18 and 65 years old.
• Tested positive for HBV for more than six months.
• Had blood HBV DNA level greater than or equal to 200 IU/mL at the start
of the study.
• Did not respond well to two or more different types of NAs, each taken
for at least six months.
