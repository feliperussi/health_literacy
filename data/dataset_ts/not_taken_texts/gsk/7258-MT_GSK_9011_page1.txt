General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in January 2019 and ended in May 2019. The study was stopped
earlier than planned. All study sites were in the United Kingdom.
What was the main objective of this study?
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term disease of the kidneys. Some people with
CKD cannot make enough red blood cells, which contain an oxygen-carrying protein
called haemoglobin (Hgb). This condition is called anaemia due to CKD. When people
have anaemia, they have reduced amount of Hgb in their blood.
