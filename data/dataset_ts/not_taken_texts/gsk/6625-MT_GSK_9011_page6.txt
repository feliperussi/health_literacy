Higher values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs and that lung function
1
is better.
Study doctors measured the FEV values on Day 1 (baseline) and then again at Week
1
12.The difference between the FEV values at baseline and after 12 weeks of
1
treatment is called the Week 12 change from baseline in FEV .
1
The Week 12 change from baseline in FEV values from individual patients in each
1
treatment group were combined and averaged. These averaged values were compared
between the seven treatment groups. The Week 12 change from baseline in FEV could
1
be calculated for 721 patients who had both baseline and Week 12 values measured.
The results are shown in the table below.

After 12 weeks of treatment, the change from baseline in the average FEV (lung

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the
end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
