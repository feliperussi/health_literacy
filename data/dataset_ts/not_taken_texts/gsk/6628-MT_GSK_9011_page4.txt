What were the main results of the study?
For this study, malaria-free is defined as no P. vivax parasites in the blood for six
months after the parasites were removed with DHA-PQP treatment.
The main objective of the study was a comparison between the TQ and DHA-PQP group
and the DHA-PQP alone group. Researchers compared the number of patients who
remained malaria-free for six months after the start of DHA-PQP treatment.
Results are shown in the table below.

Six months after receiving treatment, more patients in the TQ and DHA-PQP group
remained malaria-free compared with patients in the DHA-PQP alone group. However,
the number of patients in the PQ and DHA-PQP group who remained malaria-free was
higher compared with the other groups.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
