What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each participant’s cancer using physical examinations, scans, and
blood tests. They recorded the time in months from the day the participant entered the
study until the participants’ death. This is called Overall Survival (OS).
How long did the participants live after starting the treatment?
The median OS was calculated for each treatment group as shown in the ‘Overall survival of
participants’ figure. Median is the number in the middle of the ordered list, with equal
values above and below this number.
Participants in the feladilimab + docetaxel group received treatment ranging from 1 day to
2 years. Participants in the docetaxel alone group received treatment ranging from 1 day to
about 6 months. The results showed that the median OS between the two groups was
similar.
