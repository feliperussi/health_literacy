GSK3772847 works when added to regular asthma treatment compared with regular
asthma treatment alone. Researchers also studied the safety of GSK3772847.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were placed in one of the following two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• GSK3772847
• Placebo (no active medicine)
Neither the patients nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment.
This is called a double-blind study.
During the study, patients continued taking their regular asthma treatment. Patients
received study medicine directly through a vein on Day 1, Week 4, and Week 8 of the
12-week treatment period.
Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women with moderate to severe asthma were included in the study if
they:
• Were at least 18 years old.
• Met the required test scores to assess lung function and inflammation.
• Met the required blood eosinophil (a type of white blood cell) levels.
• Were taking regular asthma treatment for at least four months before
starting the study.
• Had AFAD with at least one severe episode of worsening of asthma
within one year before starting the study.
