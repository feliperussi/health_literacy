Where was this study done?
The study sites were in two countries. A total of 260 patients were from China and 46
patients were from the Republic of Korea.
What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patient’s lungs are moving air in and out of the
body. Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if the lung function is stable,
getting better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air that a patient can breathe out in the first second when
asked to blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer).
Higher values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs, and that lung function
1
is better. FEV is measured in millilitres (mL).

In this study, the lung function of patients receiving umeclidinium was compared with
those receiving placebo. Study doctors measured each patient’s lung function at the
