Healthy kidneys make a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). Erythropoietin prompts
the bone marrow to make red blood cells, which then carry oxygen in the blood.
Patients with CKD have diseased or damaged kidneys that do not make enough EPO. As
a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing renal anaemia. Patients
with low levels of red blood cells may struggle with daily activities like walking or
climbing stairs. See figure below.
Renal anaemia
Patients with renal anaemia may be treated with medicines called
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as darbepoetin alfa.
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents triggers the bone marrow to make more red blood
cells.
Daprodustat is a medicine that prompts the body to make more EPO, which increases
the number of red blood cells. More red blood cells lead to an increase in Hgb and
oxygen levels in the blood.
In this study, researchers wanted to see if daprodustat is similar to darbepoetin alfa in
maintaining Hgb levels in Japanese patients with renal anaemia, who were being
treated with haemodialysis and ESAs.
