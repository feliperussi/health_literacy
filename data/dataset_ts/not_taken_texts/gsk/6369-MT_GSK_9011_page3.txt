PET-CT scans were used to follow radiolabelled GSK3128349 in the body. A
PET scan produces three-dimensional images of the inside of the body. A CT
scan shows pictures of a person’s body in very thin sections.
Which people were included in this study?
Eight healthy male volunteers received one dose of radiolabelled
GSK3128349. The youngest volunteer was 53 years old and the oldest was 60.
The average age of the volunteers was 55.
What were the overall results of the study?
The volunteers received radiolabelled GSK3128349 through a needle in a vein
(intravenous (IV) infusion). The volunteers stayed in the clinic for 24 hours
after their dose. Four PET-CT scans were performed within 12 days of the
dose.
Researchers focused on certain parts of the body (these are called Regions of
Interest or ROIs). The Regions of Interest included the blood, brain, kidney,
liver, and thigh muscle. The results from the four PET-CT scans were used to
estimate the following:
• Standardised Uptake Values (SUVs) in the Regions of Interest.
• Volume of GSK3128349 in the Regions of Interest.
Standardised Uptake Values (SUVs) are calculated with a mathematical
equation that compares the concentration of the radiolabel in the region of
interest with the concentration in the rest of the body. A higher SUV means a
higher concentration in the region of interest. A higher concentration is like
the difference between a strong and a weak cup of tea.
The volume of radiolabelled GSK3128349 in each region of interest is
measured in millilitres (mLs). Volume measures the amount of space that a
substance occupies in a container, or in this case, in the Region of Interest.
Across the four PET-CT scans, the average concentration of radiolabelled
GSK3128349 was highest in the kidneys and blood and lowest in the brain.
