How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers concluded that treatment with GSK2330811 300 mg given every two
weeks was not favourable in patients with dcSSc. More patients in the GSK2330811
300 mg group had lower than normal levels of haemoglobin, platelets, and white blood
cells compared with the other two groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
No studies of GSK2330811 in patients with dcSSc are currently planned or ongoing.
