Comments on the Outcome of the Study
What did this study tell researchers?
In this study, approximately a third of the patients with typical absence seizures had no
seizures at the end of the maintenance phase. The most common adverse reaction was
rash. This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies gather information to help regulators
make decisions about approving a medicine for a condition in their country. This summary
shows the results from one study. Other studies may have different results.
We would like to thank the patients who contributed and their parents.
Further Studies
Currently no future studies of lamotrigine in patients with typical absence seizures are
planned.
