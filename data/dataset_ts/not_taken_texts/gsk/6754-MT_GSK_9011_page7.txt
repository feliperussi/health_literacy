How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers, doctors and parents understand that:
Giving pregnant mothers a dTpa vaccine does not affect the ability of the booster shot of the 6-in-1
vaccine to protect their babies against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib and polio.
The whooping cough antibodies transferred from mothers to infants during pregnancy may reduce
the infantsâ€™s ability to make their own antibodies against whooping cough but the importance of this
effect is not known.
The side effects of the 6-in-1 vaccine in infants of vaccinated mothers and mothers who did not get
dTpa vaccine during pregnancy are similar. They are known side effects of the vaccine.
Are there plans for further studies?
At the time this summary was prepared, no further studies were planned with the 6-in-1 vaccine in infants
born to mothers vaccinated against dTpa during their pregnancy.
Where can I find more information about this study?
The detailed title for this research study is:
A phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a
booster dose of Infanrix hexa in healthy infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during
pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.
