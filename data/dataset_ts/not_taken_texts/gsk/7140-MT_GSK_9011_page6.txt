found in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine and/or the
injections, they record this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine and/or the injections. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents
related to the study medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
No serious side effects were reported by patients up to Week 12.
The table below shows the number of patients (percent) reporting non-serious side
effects in any treatment group up to Week 12.

This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well a new
medicine works and how safe it is. The study showed that the addition of botulinum
toxin type A to Japanese patients’ regular medicine(s) for NDO reduced the number of
urinary incontinence episodes compared with placebo. Side effects were limited and
