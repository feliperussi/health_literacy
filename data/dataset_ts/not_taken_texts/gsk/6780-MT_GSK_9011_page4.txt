What were the overall results of the study?
This study measured the level of anti-PA antibodies in the blood four weeks after the
first dose of treatment with AVA alone or AVA and raxibacumab. Higher anti-PA
antibody levels may mean better protection against anthrax bacteria. The anti-PA
antibody levels were not measured for 28 volunteers, as they did not stay in the study
to have their antibody measurement.
