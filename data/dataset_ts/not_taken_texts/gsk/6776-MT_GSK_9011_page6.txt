Non-serious side effects
Non-serious side effects were reported by five participants (3%) each in the
daprodustat group and the darbepoetin alfa group. Two participants (1%) in the
daprodustat group had nausea. All the other non-serious side effects were reported by
less than 1% of participants each in either treatment group.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that daprodustat was similar to darbepoetin alfa in increasing
and maintaining Hgb levels in participants with anaemia due to CKD. The side effects
reported were as expected in patients with anaemia due to CKD.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat in participants with anaemia due to CKD have been
completed and some are ongoing or planned.
