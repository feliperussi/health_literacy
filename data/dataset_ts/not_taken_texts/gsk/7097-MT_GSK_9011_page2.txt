cells, which leads to an increase in Hgb levels. Daprodustat is a medicine that is being
tested to treat renal anaemia.
Researchers wanted to see how well daprodustat works in maintaining Hgb levels
compared with epoetin alfa in patients with renal anaemia. Researchers also assessed
the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1 of the 52-week treatment period, patients were included in one of the
following two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
• Daprodustat group: Patients received daprodustat tablets by mouth three times
a week.
• Epoetin alfa group: Patients received epoetin alfa through a vein (intravenously)
once or three times a week.
Twice as many patients received daprodustat compared with epoetin alfa.
Patients also received placebo (no active medicine) as tablets or intravenously. Neither
patients nor study doctors knew who received which treatment. This is called a double-
blind study.
