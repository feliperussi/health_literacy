of asthma are getting worse and it is hard to breathe, it is called an asthma attack, also
known as an asthma exacerbation.
People can develop asthma at any age, but most children with asthma will experience their
first symptoms before age 5 years.
When an asthma attack does not improve with prompt treatment at home, it can become
severe (severe asthma attack) and need emergency care in a hospital. A severe asthma
attack can become a life-threatening emergency. A breathing tube may need to be
inserted into the airways (this is called intubation). The tube is then connected to a
ventilator, a machine which pushes air into the lungs and helps the person breathe. Very
rarely a severe asthma attack can cause death.
