General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in September 2016 and ended in April 2021.
What was the main objective of this study?
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term disease of the kidneys. Some people with
CKD cannot make enough red blood cells. This condition is called anaemia due to CKD.
Red blood cells contain an oxygen-carrying protein called haemoglobin (Hgb). When
people have anaemia, they have reduced amount of Hgb in their blood.
