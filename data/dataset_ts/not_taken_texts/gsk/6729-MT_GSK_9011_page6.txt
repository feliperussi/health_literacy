The side effects in this summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent or
other documents related to the study medicine.
From Day 1 onwards, 1 of 24 patients in the GSK2330811 300 mg group had a serious
side effect of kidney cancer. This side effect was reported more than a year after the
patient completed the study. A review of this possible side effect showed that the link
between kidney cancer and the study medicine remains unclear.
No serious side effects were reported by patients in the GSK2330811 100 mg group or
the placebo group.
Non-serious side effects were reported by 1 of 3 patients in the GSK2330811 100 mg
group, 21 of 24 patients in the GSK2330811 300 mg group, and 4 of 8 patients in the
placebo group.
The table below shows the number of patients with non-serious side effects that were
reported by three or more patients in any treatment group.
