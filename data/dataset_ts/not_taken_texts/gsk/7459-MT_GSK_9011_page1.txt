The study started in April 2018 and ended in January 2020. Study enrolment ended
early as it was too difficult to enrol enough patients in a timely manner.
What was the main objective of this study?
Asthma is a long-term condition of the airways. When the airways are inflamed, they

GSK3772847 is a medicine that may reduce inflammation. Patients with moderate to
severe asthma with AFAD took part in this study. Researchers wanted to see how well
