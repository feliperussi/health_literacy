General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in February 2013 and ended in January 2019.
What was the main reason for this study?
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a long-term autoimmune disease in which a type
of white blood cell (B cells) produces proteins called autoantibodies. Autoantibodies
attack the bodyâ€™s own tissues and organs. Systemic lupus erythematosus affects each
patient differently. Common symptoms include skin rash and joint pain. Systemic lupus
erythematosus can also affect the kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, or other internal organs.
