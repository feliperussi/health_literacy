What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors recorded each participant’s height using a device called a stadiometer,
over the one year of treatment.
The main objective of the study was to compare participants’ growth rate over the
one-year treatment period, between the two treatment groups. Researchers calculated
growth rate as the increase in height in centimetres per year (cm/yr).
Growth rate was calculated for the 457 participants whose height was recorded at least
three times during the one-year treatment period. Results are shown in the table
below.
