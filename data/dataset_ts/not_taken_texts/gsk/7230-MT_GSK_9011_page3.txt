After Year 1, these participants could continue to take belimumab in Year 2, if required,
based on study doctor’s decision.
Group C:
Participants who were taking immunosuppressants before starting the study, could
continue taking these medicines throughout the study. The participants in Group C and
the main study doctors knew that the participants were receiving belimumab and
regular SLE treatment. Additionally, independent study doctors, who did not know
which treatment group the participant was in, assessed their SLE symptoms.
Between Week 12 and Week 26, the doses of corticosteroids were reduced for all
participants.
