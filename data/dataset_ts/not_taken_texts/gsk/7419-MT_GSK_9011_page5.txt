What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patientâ€™s lungs move air in and out of the body.
Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if lung function is stable, getting
better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air that a patient can breathe out in the first second when
asked to blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer).
Higher values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs and that lung function
1
is better.
Study doctors measured the FEV values on Day 1 (baseline) and at Week 12. The
1
difference between the FEV values at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment is
1
called the Week 12 change from baseline in FEV .
1
The Week 12 change from baseline in FEV values from individual patients in each
1
treatment group were combined and averaged. These averaged values were compared
between the two treatment groups. The Week 12 change from baseline in FEV could
1
be calculated for 737 patients who had both baseline and Week 12 values. The results
are shown in the table below.

After 12 weeks of treatment, the improvement in the average FEV (lung function) of
1
patients in the triple therapy group was greater compared with the tiotropium group.
