The overall results and safety results for the treatment holiday group have been
presented separately for holiday phase and restart phase. Out of the 12 patients who
started holiday phase, one patient did not enter restart phase.

scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this

What were the overall results of the study?
Study doctors scored patients’ SLE symptoms using scoring scales at the start of the
study (baseline) and once every month for 12 months. A flare scored on the SLE flare
index (SFI) scale shows worsening of SLE. An SFI flare is referred to as “flare” below.
Study doctors recorded the date of a patient’s first flare.
This study aimed to compare the time to first flare for the control and holiday
treatment groups by comparing the median time to first flare. However, as less than
half the patients in these two groups experienced a flare, the median time could not be
calculated, and the comparison could not be made. The figure below shows the
number of patients (and percentage) with a flare.
Number of patients with a flare up to Month 12
In the long-term treatment discontinuation group, the median days to first flare was
183 days. More information about the study results is available in the scientific results
summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this document).
