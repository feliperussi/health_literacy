Botulinum toxin type A is a medicine that causes muscle relaxation. Injecting botulinum
toxin type A in the bladder’s detrusor muscle may relax them, thus reducing the
contractions. This reduction in the contraction of the muscles may help reduce the
number of episodes of urinary incontinence due to NDO.
This study was conducted in Japanese patients with urinary incontinence due to NDO,
whose symptoms were not well controlled with their regular medicine(s). Study
doctors wanted to see if addition of botulinum toxin type A to patients’ regular
medicine(s) reduced the number of urinary incontinence episodes. They also assessed
the safety of botulinum toxin type A.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, patients were placed in one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation), as shown in the figure below:
• Botulinum toxin type A (200 units)
• Placebo (no active study medicine)
Study design
This study took place in two parts (phases). On Day 1, patients received
30 millilitres (mL) of botulinum toxin type A or placebo in the form of 30 (1 mL)
injections. The injections were given evenly across the detrusor muscle. Neither
patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a
double-blind phase.
After Week 12, a patient could request re-treatment. If the study doctor agreed, the
patient could be given up to two more re-treatments with botulinum toxin type A. All
