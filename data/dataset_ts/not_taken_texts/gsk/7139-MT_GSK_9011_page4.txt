What were the overall results of the study?
At the start of the study, each patient was given a diary to write down their bladder
symptoms, including urinary incontinence. The patients were asked to bring the diary
to each clinic visit.
The study doctor noted the number of urinary incontinence episodes for each patient
over any three consecutive days before visiting the clinic. The number of episodes were
averaged for each patient at Day 1 (baseline) and Week 12. This is called a daily
average number of urinary incontinence episodes.
The results from all patients within each treatment group were combined and averaged
to get the baseline and Week 12 values for each treatment group. The difference
between these two values of the daily average number of urinary incontinence
episodes is called the change from baseline.
