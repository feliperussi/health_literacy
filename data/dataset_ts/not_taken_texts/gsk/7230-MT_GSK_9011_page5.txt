What were the main results of the study?
An independent study doctor, who did not know whether the participant was in Group
A, B, or C, recorded the participants’ SLE symptoms using a scoring scale. For this study,
participants were considered to have their SLE under control if they:
• Had an SLE symptom score of two or lower.
• Were not taking immunosuppressants.
• Needed either no corticosteroids or only needed low-dose corticosteroids daily.
• Completed one year in the study.
The main focus of this study was to compare the percentage of participants between
Group A and Group B, who had their SLE under control at the end of Year 1.
The SLE symptoms score for 29 participants from Group C are not included in the
results, as the independent study doctors assessing symptoms may have known that
these participants were in Group C.
The results for the remaining 263 participants are shown in the figure below.
