Patients with anaemia may be treated with certain medicines called recombinant
human erythropoietin (rhEPO), such as darbepoetin alfa. These medicines trigger the
body to make more red blood cells, leading to an increase in Hgb levels. However, they
may also increase the risk of developing problems that affect the heart and/or the
blood vessels in these patients. Daprodustat is a medicine that is being tested to treat
anaemia due to CKD.
Endothelial dysfunction is a condition in which blood vessels become narrow and do
not open fully. Patients with endothelial dysfunction have a higher risk of having a
stroke or heart attack. One way to assess the endothelial function is to check if the
patient has normal forearm blood flow (FBF).
The FBF is assessed by measuring the increase in forearm blood vessel size when tight
blood pressure cuffs are placed at the wrist and above the elbow. Forearm blood vessel
size increases if the blood flow into the arm is normal.
Patients with anaemia due to CKD who were not receiving dialysis took part in this
study. Dialysis is a treatment that removes waste from the body and filters blood when
kidneys do not work well. Researchers wanted to see the effect of daprodustat on FBF
compared with darbepoetin alfa in these participants. Researchers also assessed the
safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1 of the treatment period, participants were assigned by chance
(randomisation) to receive one of the following two study medicines.
• Daprodustat as a tablet.
• Darbepoetin alfa as an injection under the skin.
