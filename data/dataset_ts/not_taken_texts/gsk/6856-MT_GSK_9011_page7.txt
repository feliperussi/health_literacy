The table below shows the number of non-dialysis patients (percent) reporting serious
side effects during this study.
Number of non-dialysis patients (percent) for all serious side effects
Daprodustat Epoetin beta pegol
149 patients 150 patients
Buildup of fluid in the lungs 0 1 (less than 1%)
Stroke 1 (less than 1%) 0
One patient (less than 1%) in the daprodustat group and three patients (2%) in the
epoetin beta pegol group reported a non-serious side effect of high blood pressure. No
other non-serious side effects were reported by more than one patient in either
treatment group.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. The results showed that daprodustat was
similar to epoetin beta pegol in maintaining the Hgb levels in non-dialysis patients. The
side effects reported in these patients were similar between the treatment groups.
These results will help regulators make decisions about whether to approve
daprodustat for treatment of renal anaemia in Japanese non-dialysis patients.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat as a treatment for renal anaemia have been conducted
and more are underway.
