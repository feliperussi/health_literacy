Figure 3b: Side effects after the booster vaccination between age 15 and 18 months*
* shows side effects that were reported for more than 1% of babies
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The study showed the number of shots babies get to vaccinate them against childhood diseases can be
safely reduced by using the 6-in-1 vaccine instead of the 5-in-1 vaccine plus extra vaccine shots. The
amount of antibody against whooping cough was similar in the babies who got the 6-in-1 vaccine and the
babies who got the 5-in-1 including hepatitis B vaccine.
This summary only shows results from one study. Other studies may find different results.
Are there plans for further studies?
Vaccine quality will be studied. Vaccine safety and the immune system response to the other antigens in
the 6-in-1 vaccine besides whooping cough will also be studied.
Where can I find more information about this study?
The detailed title for this research study is:
A Phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate immunogenicity and safety
of GSK Biologicals' Infanrix hexa vaccine when administered to healthy infants as primary vaccination at
2, 4 and 6 months of age, co-administered with Prevnar and Rotarix with a booster dose of GSK Biologicalsâ€™
Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 months of age.
