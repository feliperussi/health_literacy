GSK1358820 is a medicine containing a protein (botulinum toxin type A). It causes
muscle relaxation. Injecting GSK1358820 into the bladder wall may relax the bladder
muscles and reduce urinary urgency.
This study was conducted in Japanese patients with OAB. Study doctors wanted to see
if GSK1358820 reduced the number of urinary incontinence episodes compared with
placebo (containing no active medicine) 12 weeks after treatment.
Which medicines were studied?
During the study, patients were placed in one of the following two treatment groups by
chance (randomisation):
• Placebo
• GSK1358820 (containing 100 units of botulinum toxin type A)
On Day 1, patients received 10 millilitres [mL] of placebo or GSK1358820 in the form of
20 (0.5 mL) injections. The injections were given evenly across the muscles of the
bladder wall. Neither the patients nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which
treatment. This is called a double-blind phase.
After Week 12, a patient could request re-treatment. If the study doctor agreed, the
patient could be given up to two more re-treatments with GSK1358820. All the patients
knew that they received GSK1358820 during the re-treatment. This is called the open-
label phase.
