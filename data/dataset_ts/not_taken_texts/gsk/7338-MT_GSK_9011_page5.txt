What were the overall results of the study?
The main focus of the study was to compare patients’ daily adherence between
Group 1 and Group 5, from Month 4 through Month 6. Patients’ daily adherence was
measured as the average percentage of doses of Relvar/Breo Ellipta treatment taken
between this period.
The number of doses of Relvar/Breo Ellipta treatment taken by each patient were
recorded by the sensor. The percentage of doses taken by the patient was calculated
based on the number of expected doses. These percentages were combined and
averaged for each group.
Out of the 437 patients, the average percentage of doses taken could be calculated for
418 patients who were still in the study from Month 4 through Month 6.
