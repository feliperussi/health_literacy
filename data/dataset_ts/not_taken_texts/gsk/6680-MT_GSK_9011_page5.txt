The majority of patients in both study groups had improvement in asthma control. The
percentage of patients who showed an improvement in their asthma control was
higher in the Asthma Control Test group compared with the usual care group.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the treatment (medicine or
process), they record this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by any of the GSK medicine(s) prescribed to the patient during the
study (GSK medicine(s)-related side effects) or by the treatment process (study
process-related side effects). The side effects in this summary may be different to those
in the Informed Consent or other documents.
A total of 506 patients were included for the side effects summary.
No serious side effects were reported in the study.
No non-serious GSK medicine(s)-related side effects were reported in the Asthma
Control Test group. One patient (less than 1%) in the usual care group reported a
non-serious GSK medicine(s)-related side effect of rash.
