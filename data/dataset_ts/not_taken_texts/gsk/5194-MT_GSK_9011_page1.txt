General Information about the Clinical Study
Study Dates: The study started in March 2011 and ended in November 2014.
The Reason for Conducting This Study
People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are more likely to develop
heart problems compared with healthy people. Arterial stiffness, also known as hardening
of the arteries, increases the risk of heart disease. This study looked at whether or not
medicines for COPD improved arterial stiffness, which may lead to a lower risk of heart
disease. In this Phase IIIB study, researchers compared the effects of two medicines used
to treat COPD (a combination treatment), a single medicine, and no medicine (placebo).
The study also assessed the adverse reactions that patients experienced when given these
medicines.
