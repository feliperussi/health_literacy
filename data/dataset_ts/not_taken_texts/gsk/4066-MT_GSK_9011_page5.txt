What were the overall results of the study?
Study doctors measured patientsâ€™ hip bone mineral density using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. A DEXA scan is a special type of X-ray that measures
bone mineral density.
Hip bone mineral density of each patient was measured at the beginning of the study
(baseline) and at each six month visit for three years. The difference between the hip
bone mineral density values at each visit and at baseline is called change from baseline.
The change from baseline values of patients in each treatment group were combined,
averaged by visit, and converted into yearly percentages. The overall average for the
three-year treatment period was used to calculate the percent change from baseline
per year. The results for 262 patients for whom the change from baseline value could
be calculated are shown in the table below.
Percent change from baseline per year in average hip bone mineral
density
Vilanterol Fluticasone furoate
and vilanterol
132 patients 130 patients
Percent change from baseline
per year in average bone 0.18% higher 0.27% lower
mineral density
Difference in percent change
from baseline between the two 0.46%
treatment groups
Since the difference in the percent change values between the two treatment groups
was small, researchers concluded that both treatments had a similar effect on hip bone
mineral density.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
