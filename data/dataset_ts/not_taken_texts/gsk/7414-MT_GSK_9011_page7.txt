How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers concluded that patients with COPD, when treated with triple therapy)
showed an improvement in lung function. This improvement in lung function with
Ellipta inhaler (single inhaler triple therapy) was similar to that observed after
treatment with another triple therapy via two separate inhalers (multiple inhaler triple
therapy). The side effects reported in this study were similar between the treatment
groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol in patients with
COPD have been conducted and more are underway.
