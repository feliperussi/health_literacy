Number of patients
What were the main results of the study?
The study compared the percentage of patients who had a HES flare during the 32-
week treatment period.
One patient from the mepolizumab group and two patients from the placebo group did
not have a HES flare and withdrew from the study before 32 weeks. Researchers
counted these three patients as having had a HES flare in the results.
