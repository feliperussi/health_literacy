Which vaccines were studied?
The vaccine given to participants in this study was the MenACWY-CRM vaccine. It was given by injection
into the upper arm.
Participants previously got either:
The same vaccine: MenACWY-CRM (MenACWY-CRM group).
A similar vaccine: MenACWY-D (MenACWY-D group). This vaccine was also developed to protect
against meningococcal bacteria A, C, W, and Y.
No meningitis vaccine (No previous vaccine group).
How was the study done?
All participants got one dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccine. A blood sample was taken just before vaccination
and approximately 1 month after the vaccination to measure the amounts of antibodies (Figure 1). The
participants were followed for 6 months after the vaccination for potential side effects.
