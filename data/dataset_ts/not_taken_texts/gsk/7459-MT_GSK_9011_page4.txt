What were the main results of the study?
The main focus of the study was to compare blood eosinophil levels and lung
inflammation between the treatment groups.
Patients with moderate to severe asthma with AFAD have increased numbers of
eosinophils. Too many eosinophils may worsen asthma symptoms by increasing lung
inflammation. Lung inflammation increases the levels of a gas (nitric oxide) in a
patientâ€™s breath. A test was done to measure the levels of this gas.
On average, patients in both the treatment groups showed some reduction in blood
eosinophil levels and lung inflammation at Week 12 compared with Day 1 (the first day
of the treatment period).

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
