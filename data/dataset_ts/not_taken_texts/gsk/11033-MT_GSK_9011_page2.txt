Overview
Why was this study done?
GSK’s rotavirus vaccine is available for use in many countries. Some years ago, researchers found low
amounts of fragments of porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1), an animal virus, in the GSK vaccine. Although
health authorities decided that PCV-1 was not a threat to public health and to vaccinated babies and
children, GSK decided to develop a PCV-free rotavirus vaccine. The main goal of this study was to assess
safety of the PCV-free rotavirus vaccine.
What was studied? Who was in this study?
Possible vaccine side effects. 693 girls and 658 boys from 5 countries took
part in the study. They were 6 to 12 weeks
old when they got their first vaccination.
