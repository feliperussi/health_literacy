Table 1 Numbers and percentages of participants with side effects at the place of
the injection
Side Effect MenACWY-CRM group MenACWY-D group No previous vaccine
Pain 114 of 292 (39%) 96 of 296 (32%) 40 of 97 (41%)

Redness 12 of 286 (4%) 8 of 287 (3%) 10 of 92 (11%)
Note: the total number of participants in each group is not the same for all side effects. This is because some participants did
not provide any information (“yes” or “no”) for one side effect, but did provide it for another side effect.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results from this study will be submitted to regulatory agencies for evaluation and, if approved, may
enable doctors to administer a booster dose of MenACWY-CRM to people who have received a meningitis
A, C, W, Y vaccine before.
Are there plans for further studies?
There may be studies to further evaluate the MenACWY-CRM vaccine. The results of any future studies
will be available on the websites of the European Medicines Agency and/or the Unites States National
