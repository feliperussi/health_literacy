Niraparib Placebo
487 patients 246 patients

These results showed that niraparib provided about a six month longer progression-
free survival compared with placebo. This means that there was a 38% reduced risk of
cancer growth or return or patient death with niraparib treatment.
More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
