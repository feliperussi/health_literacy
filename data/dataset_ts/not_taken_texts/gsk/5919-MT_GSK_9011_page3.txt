General information about the research study
When was the study done?
The study started in October 2016 and ended in November 2018.
Why was this study done?
Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in babies and young children. Vaccines can help
protect them against rotavirus. They help the body make defenses called antibodies against the virus.
GSKâ€™s rotavirus vaccine is available for use in many countries. Some years ago, researchers found low
amounts of fragments of porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1), an animal virus, in the GSK vaccine. Although health
authorities decided that PCV-1 was not a threat to public health and to vaccinated babies and children,
GSK decided to develop a PCV-free rotavirus vaccine.
The main goals of the study were:
To compare the levels of rotavirus antibodies in babies who got 3 different production batches of the
PCV-free rotavirus vaccine.
To compare the levels of antibodies against the rotavirus, in babies who got the PCV-free rotavirus
vaccine and in babies who got the currently used rotavirus vaccine.
