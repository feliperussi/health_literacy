In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by TDF. The side effects in this summary may be different to those in
the Informed Consent or other documents related to TDF.
No serious side effects were reported up to Week 96.
Non-serious side effects were reported by 18 patients (24%) up to Week 96. The only
non-serious side effect reported by 2% or more of patients was increased levels of a
protein (beta 2 microglobulin) in urine. This was reported by 15 patients (20%).
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results of the study showed that most of the patients who switched from ETV to
TDF did not have the required reduction in blood HBsAg levels. The side effects
reported in the study were all non-serious.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on TDF in patients with chronic hepatitis B have been conducted and
more are underway.
