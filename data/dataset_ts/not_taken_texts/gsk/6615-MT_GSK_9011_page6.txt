What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
A total of 2956 participants (1482 participants in the daprodustat group and
1474 participants in the rhEPO group) received at least one dose of study medicine.
Side effects were reported for these participants while they were receiving study
medicine.
Serious side effects
In this study, serious side effects were reported as fatal serious side effects and non-
fatal serious side effects.
Fatal serious side effects were reported by four participants (less than 1%) in the
daprodustat group and one participant (less than 1%) in the rhEPO group.
