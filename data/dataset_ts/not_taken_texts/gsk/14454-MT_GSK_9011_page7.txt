What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Researchers record these events.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the researchers think may have
been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be different to
those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study medicine.
A summary of all events reported in this study may be found in the clinical results summary
at the end of this document.
A total of 14 participants in Part 1 (7 participants in Group 1A and 7 participants in
Group 1B) and 108 participants in Part 2 (53 participants in Group 2A and 55 participants in
Group 2B) received at least one dose of study medicine. Side effects were reported for
these participants.
What were the serious side effects?
The side effects were considered “serious” if they caused death, were life threatening,
caused lasting problems, or required hospital care.
In this study, serious side effects were reported as fatal serious side effects that led to death
and non-fatal serious side effects.
