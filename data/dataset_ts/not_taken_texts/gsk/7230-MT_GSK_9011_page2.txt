People with SLE who were receiving regular treatment took part in this study. Regular
SLE treatment could include the use of corticosteroids that reduces inflammation and
immunosuppressants that slows down the immune system.
Which medicines were studied?
Belimumab and rituximab are the two medicines that were studied. The researchers
mainly wanted to see if belimumab when given in combination with rituximab worked
better than belimumab given alone in participants with SLE. They also assessed the
safety of these medicines.
On Day 1, participants were included in one of the following three treatment groups –
Group A, B, or C respectively by chance (randomisation), as shown in the figure below.
The number of participants included in Group B was twice the number of participants
included in Group A or Group C.
Study design
 Belimumab was given as an injection under the skin of the thigh or the abdomen
once a week.
 Rituximab or placebo (no active medicine) was given as an injection directly through
a vein at Week 4 and Week 6.
Group A and Group B:
Participants who were taking immunosuppressants before starting the study, were
asked to stop taking these medicines by Week 4. During Year 1, neither the participants
in these treatment groups nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which
