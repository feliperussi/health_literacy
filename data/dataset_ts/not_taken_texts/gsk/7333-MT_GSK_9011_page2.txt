For any treatment to work well, patients should take it as directed by their doctor. One
of the reasons for the worsening of asthma symptoms is the incorrect use of an inhaler.
Incorrect use leads to the delivery of a lower than expected dose of inhaled medicine(s)
in the lungs that may lead to poor control of asthma.
What was the main objective of this study?
This study assessed the percentage of children from two different age groups, who
used the Ellipta inhaler correctly after four weeks and rated it easy to use. For this
study, the correct use of the inhaler meant that the children avoided making mistakes
that could result in receiving little or no medicine.
Which device was studied?
In this study, each child received an Ellipta Ellipta inhaler
inhaler filled with placebo (no active
medicine).
Children took their regular asthma
medicine(s) and did not receive any extra
medicine as part of this study.
How was this study designed?
Children were put into one of the two groups based on their age (see figure below).
