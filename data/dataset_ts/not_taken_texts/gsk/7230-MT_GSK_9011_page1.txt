General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
This study started in March 2018 and ended in July 2021.
What was the main reason for this study?
The immune system, which includes a type of white blood cell called B cells, protects
the body from germs such as bacteria and viruses. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
is a long-term autoimmune disease in which B cells produce proteins called
autoantibodies. Autoantibodies attack the bodyâ€™s own tissues and organs and can cause
inflammation. This disease can affect almost any organ in the body and the symptoms
vary across people with SLE. Common symptoms include skin rash and joint pain.
