What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
A total of 3870 participants (1937 participants in the daprodustat group and
1933 participants in the darbepoetin alfa group) received at least one dose of study
medicine. Side effects were reported for these participants while they were receiving
study medicine.
Serious side effects
In this study, serious side effects were reported as fatal serious side effects and
non-fatal serious side effects.
Fatal serious side effects were reported by six participants (less than 1%) in the
daprodustat group and one participant (less than 1%) in the darbepoetin alfa group.
