Patients with renal anaemia may be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs), such as epoetin alfa. These agents may increase blood pressure in patients with
renal anaemia. Daprodustat is a medicine that is being tested to treat renal anaemia.
Researchers wanted to see how well daprodustat works in maintaining blood pressure
compared with epoetin alfa in patients with renal anaemia. Researchers also assessed
the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, patients were included in one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation), as shown in the figure below.
Study design
The patient and the study doctor knew which treatment the patient received.
