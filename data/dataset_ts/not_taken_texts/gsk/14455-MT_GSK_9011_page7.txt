What were the non-serious side effects?
The side effects that are not considered serious are called non-serious side effects. The
non-serious side effects reported by three or more participants in any treatment group are
shown in the figure below.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that participants in Group 1 responded well to the niraparib and
pembrolizumab combination treatment compared with Group 2. Due to fewer participants,
researchers could not conclude if niraparib alone worked in Group 3. As no participants
entered Group 2A, a comparison for Group 1A could not be done. The side effects reported
in this study were as expected.
Are there any plans for further studies?
Few studies of niraparib in participants with NSCLC are ongoing. No other studies of
niraparib in participants with NSCLC are planned or completed.
