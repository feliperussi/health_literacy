Non-fatal serious side effects were reported by 30 participants (2%) in the daprodustat
group and nine participants (less than 1%) in the darbepoetin alfa group. No specific
non-fatal serious side effects were reported by 1% or more of participants in either
treatment group.
Non-serious side effects
Non-serious side effects were reported by 93 participants (5%) in the daprodustat
group and 60 participants (3%) in the darbepoetin alfa group. No specific non-serious
side effects were reported by 1% or more of participants in either treatment group.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that daprodustat was similar to darbepoetin alfa in increasing
and/or maintaining Hgb levels in participants with anaemia due to CKD who were not
on dialysis. The study showed that taking daprodustat did not increase the risk of a
major cardiovascular problem compared with darbepoetin alfa. The side effects
reported were as expected in participants with anaemia due to CKD who were not
receiving dialysis.
