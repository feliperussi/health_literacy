What were the overall results of the study?
To determine how well TDF worked, study doctors measured the amount of HBV DNA
in the blood. They collected blood samples and measured patients’ HBV DNA levels on
Day 1 and every 12 weeks during the study as shown in the figure below:
Overall results
For this study, HBV DNA level less than 20 IU/mL indicated that the patient responded
to TDF. The main focus of the study was to see the percentage of patients with blood
HBV DNA level less than 20 IU/mL at Week 144.
At Week 144, 77% of the patients who had previously not responded to treatment with
multiple NAs, responded to TDF.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
