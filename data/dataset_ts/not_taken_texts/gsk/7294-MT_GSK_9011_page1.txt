General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in December 2016 and ended in June 2017.
What was the main reason for conducting this study?
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term disease of the lungs that
makes it hard to breathe and gets worse over time. For patients with COPD, inhalers
are an important part of treatment. An inhaler is a handheld device that is designed to
deliver medicine to the lungs.
GSK has developed an inhaler (called ELLIPTA) for patients with COPD. It provides a
combination of up to three medicines in one inhaler. The other inhalers included in the
study (DISKUS, Turbuhaler and HandiHaler) only have one or two medicines. Patients
with COPD, who are required to take three inhaled medicines, must often use two or
