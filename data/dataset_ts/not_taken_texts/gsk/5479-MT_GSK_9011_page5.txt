What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors monitored patients’ kidney function to assess how belimumab works in
patients with lupus nephritis.
Patients were considered to have responded if:
• They continued taking the study treatment up to Week 104.
AND
• Their kidney function improved to the required levels.
The percentage of patients who responded (responder rate) at Week 104 was
calculated.
The results for 446 patients are shown in the figure below.
