What were the overall results of the study?
Study doctors collected blood samples from all patients. They measured each patient’s
Hgb level on Day 1 and every four weeks during the study.
The main focus of the study was to see whether daprodustat is similar to darbepoetin
alfa in maintaining Hgb levels between Week 40 to Week 52. All patients’ Hgb levels at
Weeks 40, 44, 48, and 52 were combined and averaged.
