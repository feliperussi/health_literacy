What were the main results of the study? *
There were no important differences in the amounts of whooping cough antibodies between the 2 vaccine
groups, after the first 3 (primary) vaccinations.
Figure 2 shows the three different types of whooping cough antibodies (called ‘anti-FHA’, ‘anti-PRN’ and
‘anti-PT’) measured in the blood samples. In this figure, the antibody response to the 6-in-1 vaccine is
compared with the antibody response to the 5-in-1 vaccine (including hepatitis B) + Hib. These vaccines
are both made by the same manufacturer.

Geometric mean concentration (GMC) is a measure of the average amount of antibodies in blood.
* This report focuses on the results of the main goals of the study. All results may be found in the clinical results summary.
The results for antibodies against the other 5 diseases may be found in the clinical results summary and
were not the main focus of this study. However, in the 6-in-1 vaccine group it should be noted that:
After the primary vaccination
All babies were protected against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and hepatitis B.
Nearly all babies (94.8%) were protected against Hib.
After the booster vaccination
All babies were protected against Hib.
