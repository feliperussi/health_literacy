Overview
Why was this study done?
The researchers wanted to learn if changing the manufacturing process for a rotavirus vaccine changes
how babies respond to 3 common childhood vaccines.
What was studied? Who was in this study?
 Babies responses (antibodies) to  1272 healthy American babies (655
vaccines against common boys and 617 girls)

tetanus, whooping cough,

 Possible side effects of study
vaccines.
What kind of study was it? Main results
