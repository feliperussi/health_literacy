What was the main objective of this study?
The goal was to see if different COPD medicines affected the overall survival of patients
in the study. All patients had COPD and either heart disease or a high risk of getting
heart disease.
Which medicines were studied?
For patients with COPD, inhaled medicines taken every day can be an important part of
treatment. An inhaler is a device that is designed to deliver medicine to the lungs.
The patients who took part in this study were placed into one of four treatment groups
