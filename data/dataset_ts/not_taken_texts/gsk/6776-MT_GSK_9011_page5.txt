What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
The side effects in this summary have been reported for the 52-week treatment period.
Serious side effects
No serious side effect was reported in the daprodustat group. Two participants in the
darbepoetin alfa group reported serious side effects. One participant had kidney cancer
and the other participant had a blood clot formed at or near the dialysis site where two
blood vessels were surgically connected.
