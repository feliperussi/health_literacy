The average Hgb levels for the 217 non-dialysis patients who met criteria were
considered for the results. Results are shown in the table below.
Average haemoglobin level in non-dialysis patients
(Week 40 to Week 52)
Daprodustat Epoetin beta pegol
108 patients 109 patients
Average Hgb level 11.97 g/dL 11.86 g/dL
Difference in average Hgb level
between daprodustat group 0.10 g/dL
and epoetin beta pegol group
During Week 40 to Week 52, average Hgb levels in the two treatment groups were
similar.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
