that as well. This summary reports adverse events that may have been related
to the molecule. These are called adverse reactions.
• An adverse reaction is a medical problem that develops during the
study that the doctor thinks could have been caused by the study
medicine.
• A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life
threatening, requires hospitalisation, or results in death or permanent
damage.
In this study, three adverse events were reported. The investigator did not
think that they were related to radiolabelled GSK3128349, therefore no
adverse reactions were reported in this study.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study looked at how radiolabelled GSK3128349 was distributed in the
body. The molecule was well tolerated by the volunteers.
Are there plans for further studies?
Future studies will collect more information about the safety of GSK3128349
and find out what happens when it is attached to a medicine or another small
molecule or protein. The methods used in this study can also help researchers
design studies of other types of protein-based therapies.
