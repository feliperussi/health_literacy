The Week 24 change from baseline in FEV could be calculated for 2310 patients who
1
had both Day 1 and Week 24 values. The results are shown in the figure below.

After 24 weeks, the improvement in the average FEV of patients in the triple therapy
1
groups was greater compared with the dual therapy groups.
