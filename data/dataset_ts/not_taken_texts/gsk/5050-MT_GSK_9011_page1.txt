General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The main part of this study (Part 2) started in April 2014 and ended in November 2016.
What were the reasons for conducting this study?
Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitos. People get malaria if they are
bitten by a mosquito that is infected with Plasmodium parasites. When an infected
mosquito bites a person, the parasite is passed from the mosquito into a person’s
blood.
Once infected, the malaria parasites live and grow in the person’s body. They feed on
blood cells, causing a person to get sick. Malaria can cause high fever, chills and other
flu-like symptoms. Symptoms need to be treated quickly or the person could die.
