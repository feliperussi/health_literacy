Systemic lupus erythematosus occurs more frequently and is often more severe in
people of black race. Belimumab is a medicine that decreases the number of
autoantibodies. In this study, researchers wanted to see how well belimumab works
when it is given along with regular SLE treatment to patients with SLE who self-identify
as black race. They also studied the safety of belimumab.
Which medicines were studied?
As shown in the figure below, patients were placed in one of the two treatment groups
by chance (randomisation). Twice as many patients received belimumab compared
with placebo (no active medicine). Patients received belimumab or placebo directly
through a vein (intravenous [IV] infusion). Throughout the course of the study, patients
continued taking their regular SLE treatment.
Study design
This study took place in two parts (phases). During the first 52 weeks, neither the
patients nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called
a double-blind phase. After Week 52, patients could continue in the open-label phase
of the study and receive belimumab.
