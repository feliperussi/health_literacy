What was the main objective of this study?
In this study, the study doctors wanted to see if umeclidinium improved the lung
function of Chinese and Korean patients with COPD. They also studied the safety of
umeclidinium in these patients.
Which medicines were studied?
During the study, patients were included in one of the following two treatment groups
by chance (randomisation).
• Placebo (containing no active medicine)
• Umeclidinium (62.5 micrograms)
Twice as many patients were included in the umeclidinium group compared with the
placebo group.
Patients took the study medicine through an inhaler once daily in the morning for
24 weeks. An inhaler is a handheld device that delivers medicine to the lungs. Neither
patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a
double-blind study.
