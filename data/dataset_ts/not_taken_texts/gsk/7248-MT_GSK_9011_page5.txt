What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patient’s lungs move air in and out of the body.
Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if lung function is stable, getting
better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air a patient can breathe out in the first second when asked to
blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer). Higher
values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs and that lung function is
1
better.
Study doctors measured FEV values, before patients took the study medicines, on
1
Day 1 (baseline), and at Week 24. The difference between FEV values at baseline and
1
after 24 weeks of treatment is called the Week 24 change from baseline in FEV .

The Week 24 change from baseline in FEV values from individual patients in each
1
treatment group were combined and averaged. These averaged values of the dual
therapy group were compared with each of the two triple therapy groups within in
each set:
• Set A (low-dose fluticasone furoate groups):
- Group 1 (dual therapy) compared with Group 2 (triple therapy)
- Group 1 (dual therapy) compared with Group 3 (triple therapy).
• Set B (high-dose fluticasone furoate groups):
- Group 4 (dual therapy) compared with Group 5 (triple therapy)
- Group 4 (dual therapy) compared with Group 6 (triple therapy).
