Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is a type of parasite which causes malaria. The presence of
P. vivax parasites in the blood makes a patient feel unwell. These parasites can also
hide in the patientâ€™s liver, even after the patient feels better. The P. vivax parasites can
later come out of the liver into the blood and make the patient unwell again.
Tafenoquine (TQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP), and primaquine (PQ)
are medicines that are used to treat malaria. DHA-PQP treats malaria by removing
P. vivax parasites from the blood. TQ and PQ stop further episodes of malaria by
removing the parasites from the liver.
In this study, researchers compared a combination of TQ and DHA-PQP with DHA-PQP
alone in men with P. vivax malaria. They wanted to see how well TQ worked at
stopping malaria from returning within six months after treatment with DHA-PQP.
Researchers also assessed the safety of TQ.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were placed in one of the three treatment groups by chance (randomisation),
as shown in the figure below.
Study design
Patients in all the three treatment groups received DHA-PQP. No matter what
treatment group patients were in, each patient received the same number of tablets or
capsules for 14 days. Neither patients nor study doctors knew who received which
treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
