Part 1
In Part 1, researchers wanted to assess the safety of niraparib when given along with
pembrolizumab. They wanted to identify a safe niraparib dose that could be used for Part 2.
For this, the reseachers assessed the unacceptable side effects that occurred within three
weeks of starting treatment. This is called dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
Part 2
In Part 2, researchers wanted to assess the effects of the combination treatment of
niraparib and pembrolizumab.
Participants in Part 1 and 2 received treatment as long as their cancer did not get worse, or
have any other medical problems, or asked to be removed from the study.
