What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summaries (see the links at the end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects*” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine(s).
* The side effects in this summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent or
other documents related to the study medicine(s).
No serious side effects were reported by patients in the study.
No non-serious side effects were reported by more than one percent of patients in any
of the three treatment groups.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study showed that the umeclidinium and vilanterol combination group was more
effective than umeclidinium or salmeterol alone in treating COPD.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies with the combination of umeclidinium and vilanterol in patients with
COPD have been conducted. No further studies are planned at this time.
