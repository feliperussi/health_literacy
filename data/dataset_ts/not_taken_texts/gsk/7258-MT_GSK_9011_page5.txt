No side effects were reported in this study.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers could not compare the effect of daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa on FBF.
This could be because the study was stopped earlier than planned and the number of
participants in the study was too small. No side effects were reported during this study.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat in participants with anaemia due to CKD have been
completed. Some studies are ongoing or planned.
