General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in August 2016 and ended in January 2017. All volunteers
went to the same study site in the Netherlands.
What were the reasons for studying this molecule?
Some medicines pass through the body quickly because they are very small.
Patients often need to take a number of doses to get the benefits.
Researchers want to know if some medicines could be attached to an antibody
that would attach to a natural protein in the body. The medicine, when linked
to the antibody and the protein, might stay in the body longer so patients
wouldn’t need to take the medicine as often.
