At Week 6, the percentage of patients who responded to the study medicine
(responder rate) was calculated. Results are shown in the figure below.

Treatment groups
The responder rate at Week 6 was 18% higher in the botulinum toxin type A (400 units)
group compared with the botulinum toxin type A (240 units) group. This means
patients who received 400 units of botulinum toxin type A showed more improvement
in the movement of elbow muscles compared with patients receiving 240 units of
botulinum toxin type A.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (see the link at the end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
