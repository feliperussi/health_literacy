long-term nature of asthma, patients can have low adherence to treatment that may
lead to poor control of asthma symptoms.
How was this study designed?
To monitor patients’ adherence to treatment, all inhalers used in this study had a
sensor clipped on to them. These sensors recorded the time and date when the
patients used their inhalers. This information could be viewed by the patients on an
app installed on their smartphone and by the study doctor or nurse on their computer.
Together, the sensors, the app, and the computer system, are called the Connected
Inhaler System (CIS).
The main objective of this study was to see how the use of CIS affected poorly
controlled asthma patients’ adherence to their Relvar/Breo Ellipta treatment.
Which medicines and devices were used in the study?
Before starting the study, patients were asked to replace their previous asthma
treatment (if different) with Relvar/Breo Ellipta.
All patients received Relvar/Breo Ellipta inhaler, with the sensor clipped on it, to be
used once daily. This inhaler contained:
• fluticasone furoate (an inhaled corticosteroid [ICS], a medicine that reduces
swelling and irritation in the lungs) and,
• vilanterol (an inhaled long-acting beta agonist [LABA], a medicine that relaxes
and opens the airways in the lungs).
Patients were prescribed another inhaler, with a sensor clipped on it, containing
salbutamol (a medicine that relaxes and opens the airways in the lungs), to use if their
asthma symptoms worsened.
