What were the main results of the study?
The main objective was to compare daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa in increasing
and maintaining participants’ Hgb levels during Week 28 to Week 52 (testing period) of
the study.
Study doctors collected blood samples from the participants. They measured each
participant’s Hgb levels on Day 1 (baseline) and during the testing period. The
difference in the participant’s baseline Hgb value and the average Hgb value during the
testing period was calculated. This is called the change from baseline for each
participant.
