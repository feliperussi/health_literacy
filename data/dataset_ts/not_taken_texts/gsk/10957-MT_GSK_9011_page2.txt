General information about the clinical study
This is a “platform study” made up of many smaller studies called sub-studies. In these
types of studies, researchers use the same plan to test different medicines to treat a
disease.
When was this study done?
The first sub-study started in January 2019 and ended in September 2021. The results of this
sub-study are presented in this summary.
An additional sub-study was also started; however, researchers could not draw any
conclusion as this sub-study ended early. Other sub-studies are ongoing and more are
planned. Results of each sub-study will be presented in a separate summary when they are
finished.
Which medicines were studied?
Feladilimab and docetaxel are the two medicines studied in this sub-study.
What was the main reason for this study?
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Common
symptoms include cough that does not go away, chest pain, and tiredness. When NSCLC has
spread beyond the lungs into other areas of the body, it is considered as advanced NSCLC.
Some cancer cells have a type of protein called programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on
their surface. These are called PD-L1 positive cancers. Current treatment options include
chemotherapy with platinum-based medicines and medicines that block PD-L1 protein.
Some people may respond to treatment while some do not. Of those who respond, the
cancer may come back after being treated.
For these reasons, researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced NSCLC. In this
sub-study, they wanted to know if feladilimab + docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone
improved survival.
