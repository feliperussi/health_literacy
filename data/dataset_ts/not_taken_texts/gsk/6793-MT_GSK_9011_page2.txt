Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray (FFNS) is a corticosteroid These medicines reduce
swelling and soreness in the nose which are often caused by allergic rhinitis. These
medicines are sprayed into the nose as a fine mist. FFNS is approved in many countries
to treat allergic rhinitis in children and adults. In this study, the study doctors wanted
to see if different doses of FFNS reduced the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in Chinese
children. They also studied the safety of FFNS in these children.
Which medicines were studied in this study?
Children were included in one of the following three treatment groups by chance
(randomisation).
• Placebo (containing no active medicine)
• FFNS 55 µg once daily
• FFNS 110 µg once daily
Instructions on how to use the nasal spray correctly were given to the children and
their parents. The children (on their own or with the help of their parents) sprayed the
medicine in their nose each morning for four weeks. The children, their parents and
study doctors did not know which of the three medicines were given to each child. This
is called a double-blind study.
