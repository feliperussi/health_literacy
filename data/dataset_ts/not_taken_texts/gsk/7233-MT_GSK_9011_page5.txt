How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers did not see a difference between daprodustat and epoetin alfa in
maintaining blood pressure in patients with renal anaemia. The non-serious side effects
reported in this study were as expected.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat in patients with renal anaemia have been conducted and
some are ongoing or planned.
