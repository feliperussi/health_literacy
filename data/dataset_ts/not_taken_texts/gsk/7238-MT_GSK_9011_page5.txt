Nasal polyp size
During the study, study doctors measured and scored patients’ polyp size in each
nostril every four weeks. Total nasal polyp scores ranged from zero (no polyps) to eight
(large polyps causing blockage in both nostrils). The difference between the total nasal
polyp score at Day 1 and after 52 weeks of treatment was calculated.
Patients in the mepolizumab group showed a one-point average improvement from
Day 1 in total nasal polyp score. An improvement in the total nasal polyp score means a
reduction in nasal polyp size. On average, patients in the placebo group showed no
improvement from Day 1 in total nasal polyp score.
Nasal obstruction score
Patients rated the severity of their nasal obstruction once daily. Nasal obstruction
scores ranged from 0 (none) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). The difference between
the average nasal obstruction score for the week before Day 1 and four weeks before
Week 52 was calculated.
Patients in the mepolizumab group showed a more than four-point average
improvement from Day 1 in nasal obstruction score. An improvement in the nasal
obstruction score means a reduction in nasal obstruction. Patients in the placebo group
showed a less than one-point average improvement from Day 1 in nasal obstruction
score.
Risk of having nasal polyp surgery
Study doctors recorded the time (in weeks) from Day 1 to the patient’s first nasal polyp
surgery in this study. Researchers then calculated the risk of a patient having nasal
polyp surgery. The risk value was then converted to a percentage to show the degree
to which mepolizumab reduced the risk of having nasal polyp surgery compared with
placebo.
When used in addition to regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment, mepolizumab
reduced the risk of having nasal polyp surgery by 57%, compared with placebo.
