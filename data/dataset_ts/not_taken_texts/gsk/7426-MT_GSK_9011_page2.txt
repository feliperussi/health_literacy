Botulinum toxin type A is a medicine that causes muscle relaxation. Injecting botulinum
toxin type A in muscles relaxes them and reduces spasticity.
This study was conducted in Japanese patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity.
In Japan, botulinum toxin type A (240 units) is the approved dose for the treatment of
upper limb spasticity. However, a higher dose of botulinum toxin type A may be
required in severe cases.
In this study, study doctors wanted to see if a higher dose of botulinum toxin type A
(400 units) improved upper limb spasticity compared with the approved dose of
botulinum toxin type A (240 units) six weeks after treatment.
Which medicines were studied?
This study took place in two parts. On Day 1, patients received injections of botulinum
toxin type A (either 240 units or 400 units) by chance (randomisation), as shown in the
figure below.
Study design
Botulinum toxin type A (240 units): 240 units were injected into the muscles of the fingers,
thumb, and wrist, and placebo (no active medicine) was injected into the muscles of elbow.
Botulinum toxin type A (400 units): 240 units were injected into the muscles of the fingers,
thumb, and wrist, and 160 units were injected into the muscles of elbow.
During the first 12 weeks, neither the patients nor the study doctors knew who
received which treatment. This is called a double-blind phase.
