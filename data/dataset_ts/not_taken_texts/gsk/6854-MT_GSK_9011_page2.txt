umeclidinium alone. Researchers also compared these treatments with salmeterol.
They assessed the safety of these medicines in the patients.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients took the study medicine(s) through inhalers for 24 weeks. An inhaler is a
handheld device that is designed to deliver medicine to the lungs.
Patients in this study were put into one of the following three treatment groups by
chance. This is called randomisation.
Medicines used in the study
Umeclidinium and • A combination of umeclidinium 62.5 microgram (mcg)
vilanterol and vilanterol 25 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA inhaler
Umeclidinium • Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg once daily via ELLIPTA inhaler
Salmeterol • Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily via DISKUS inhaler
Bronchodilators are medicines that relax and open the airways in the lungs. Umeclidinium is
an inhaled long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Vilanterol and salmeterol are inhaled
long‐acting beta agonists (LABA). LAMA and LABA are different types of bronchodilators.
In addition to the above medicine(s), the patients in each treatment group also
received placebo via inhaler (containing no active medicine).
All the patients received a total of three doses in a day: two doses (morning and
evening) via the DISKUS inhaler and one dose (morning) via the ELLIPTA inhaler. Neither
patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a
double-blind study.
