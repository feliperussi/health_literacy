What were the main results of the study?
This report focuses on the results of the main goals of the study. All results may be found in the clinical
results summary.
The most common side effects reported by volunteers during the whole study period are shown in Table
1.
What were the side effects?1
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a vaccine. Study
doctors record all these events. A summary of all events reported in this study may be found in Table 1
and in the clinical results summary.
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the vaccine, they record it as a possible side effect
(adverse reaction).
1In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may have been caused by the study vaccine.
