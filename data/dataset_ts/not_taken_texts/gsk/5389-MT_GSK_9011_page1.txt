General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in January 2011 and ended in July 2015.
What was the reason for this study?
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term disease of the lungs that
makes it hard to breathe and gets worse over time. It usually takes many years for
COPD symptoms to appear, so COPD is more common in older people and past or
current smokers. Heart disease is also more common in older people and smokers.
People with both COPD and heart disease have a higher risk of dying at an earlier age
than people in the general population.
