called programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). These are called PD-L1 positive cancers.
People with PD-L1 positive cancers may have different amounts of the protein on their
surface. More PD-L1 protein on the cancer cell may make it easier to destroy them.
In this study, researchers wanted to see if niraparib when given alone or in combination
with either pembrolizumab or dostarlimab could shrink the tumours partially or completely.
Researchers also assessed the safety of this medicine.
How was the study done?
This was a double-blind study which means neither the participants nor the study doctors
knew who was receiving which study medicine.
Participants were divided based on the amount of the PD-L1 protein on the lung cancer
cells. As shown in the figure below, the study was conducted in two parts. In Part 1,
participants received niraparib + pembrolizumab or niraparib alone. In Part 2, participants
received niraparib + dostarlimab.
Participants took niraparib capsule once daily as long as their cancer did not get worse.
Pembrolizumab was given to participants directly through the vein once in three weeks for
two years as long as their cancer did not get worse or they did not have any other medical
problems. Dostarlimab was given to participants directly through the vein once in three
weeks for the first four months followed by once in six weeks for two years as long as their
cancer did not get worse or they did not have any other medical problems.
