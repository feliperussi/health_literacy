Non-fatal serious side effects were reported by 25 participants (2%) in the daprodustat
group and 26 participants (2%) in the rhEPO group. No non-fatal serious side effects
were reported by 1% or more of participants in either treatment group.
Non-serious side effects
Non-serious side effects were reported by 85 participants (6%) in the daprodustat
group and 61 participants (4%) in the rhEPO group. No non-serious side effects were
reported by 1% or more of participants in either treatment group.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that daprodustat was similar to rhEPO in maintaining Hgb levels
in participants with anaemia due to CKD. The study showed that taking daprodustat did
not increase the risk of a major cardiovascular problem compared with rhEPO. The side
effects reported were as expected in patients with anaemia due to CKD who were
receiving dialysis.
