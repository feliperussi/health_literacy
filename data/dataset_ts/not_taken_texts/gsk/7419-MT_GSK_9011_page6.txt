What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine(s). The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
No serious side effects were reported in the study up to Week 12.
No non-serious side effects were reported by one percent or more of patients in either
treatment group up to Week 12.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers concluded that patients with COPD, when treated with triple therapy using
the Ellipta inhaler, showed a greater improvement in lung function compared with
tiotropium alone using HandiHaler. The side effects reported in this study were limited
in number and non-serious.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol in patients with
COPD have been conducted and more are underway.
