What were the main results of the study?
The main objective was to compare daprodustat with placebo in improving
participants’ Hgb levels during Week 24 to Week 28 (testing period) of the study.
Study doctors collected blood samples from the participants. They measured each
participant’s Hgb levels on Day 1 (baseline) and during the testing period. The
difference in the participant’s baseline Hgb value and the average Hgb value during the
testing period was calculated. This is called the change from baseline for each
participant.
