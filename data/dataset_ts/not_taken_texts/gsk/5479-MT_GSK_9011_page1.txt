General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in July 2012 and ended in March 2020.
What was the main objective of this study?
Lupus nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). In patients with SLE, the body produces autoantibodies that
attack its own tissues and organs. An autoantibody attack on the kidneys may cause
reduced kidney function.
Belimumab is a medicine that decreases the number of autoantibodies. Researchers
wanted to see how well belimumab works when added to regular lupus nephritis
treatment. They also studied the safety of belimumab.
