What were the main results of the study?
This report focuses on the results of the main goals of the study. All results may be found in the clinical
results summary.
Antibodies measured at 9 years and 10 years after vaccination
After 10 years, the body’s defences against the shingles virus were higher than before the original
vaccination. At year 10, the body’s defences were at similar levels to those 4 years after vaccination. Figure
2 shows antibody responses. The responses of immune system cells followed a similar pattern.
Antibodies measured after booster (re-vaccination) doses
Booster doses stimulated body defences against the shingles virus. The response of the body’s defence
system to the first re-vaccination was similar to the first vaccination, given 10 years earlier.
