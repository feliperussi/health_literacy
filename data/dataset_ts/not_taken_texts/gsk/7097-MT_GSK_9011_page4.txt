What were the main results of the study?
The main objective was to compare daprodustat with epoetin alfa in maintaining
patients’ Hgb levels during Week 28 to Week 52 (testing period) of the study.
Study doctors collected blood samples from the patients. They measured each patient’s
Hgb levels on Day 1 (baseline) and during the testing period. The difference in the
patient’s baseline Hgb value and the average Hgb value during the testing period was
calculated. This is called the change from baseline for each patient.
The average change from baseline in Hgb levels was calculated for each treatment
group. These values were similar for both the treatment groups.
