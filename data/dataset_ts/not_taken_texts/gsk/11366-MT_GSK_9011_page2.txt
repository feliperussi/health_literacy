Otilimab is a medicine also being tested to treat inflammation in patients with other
diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. It is thought to be able to reduce lung inflammation
caused by COVID-19 related lung disease.
Patients who were hospitalised with severe COVID-19 related lung disease (such as
pneumonia) and were receiving standard-of-care (SoC) treatment took part in this
study. The SoC treatment includes the normal hospital care and usual treatments that
are given to patients with the same condition. Researchers wanted to see if otilimab
would improve these participants’ recovery and chances of survival when added to SoC
treatment, compared with SoC treatment alone. Researchers also assessed the safety
of this medicine.
Which medicines were studied?
Participants who decided to take part in the study continued to receive SoC. In
addition, participants received one of the following two study medicines:
• Otilimab
(or)
• Placebo
Placebo, also known as a dummy medicine, looked like otilimab but did not contain
actual medicine. A computer decided which study medicine the participants would
receive by chance, as if by tossing a coin. Neither participants nor study doctors knew
who was receiving which study medicine. This is to make sure the results of each
treatment group were handled in the same way. This is called a double-blind study.
Participants received the study medicine directly through a vein on Day 1. Study
doctors monitored participants daily in the hospital until they were discharged. After
being discharged, the study doctors regularly contacted the participants to check on
how they were doing for up to two months after they were first admitted to the
hospital.
