How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. This study showed that daprodustat was similar
to darbepoetin alfa in maintaining the patientsâ€™ Hgb levels. These results will help
regulators make decisions about whether to approve daprodustat for treatment of
renal anaemia in Japanese patients being treated with haemodialysis and ESAs.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat as a treatment for renal anaemia have been conducted
and more are underway.
