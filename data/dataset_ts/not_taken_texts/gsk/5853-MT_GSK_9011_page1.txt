General Information about the Study
Study Dates
The study started in September 2011 and ended in November 2015.
The Main Objective(s) of the Study
The objective of this study was to see how well a medicine called lamotrigine
treated children in Japan and South Korea who had a certain type of seizures
called typical absence seizures. The results of the study provide information to
help a government agency in Japan make a decision about approving
lamotrigine for typical absence seizures.
Typical absence seizures are short periods when the person stops what they
are doing and stares blankly. These seizures may occur many times per day.
The person may seem like they are daydreaming, but they can’t react if
someone approaches them.
