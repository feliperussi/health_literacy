How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study showed that 10 years after vaccination, levels of body defences against shingles were higher
than before first vaccination and similar to levels 4 years after first vaccination. Currently, we do not know
the level of the body’s defences needed for protection against this disease. However, the persistence of
antibodies suggests that the vaccine may still work against the shingles virus for up to 10 years after
vaccination.
Are there plans for further studies?
There are no further studies planned of the persistence of response to shingles re-vaccination. There are
several ongoing and planned studies looking at the effects of this shingles vaccine in different age groups
and in people with different medical conditions.
Where can I find more information about this study?
The detailed title for this research study is:
A phase IIIB, open, long-term extension study to evaluate the persistence of immune responses and the
safety of GSK Biologicals’ Herpes Zoster subunit (HZ/su) vaccine 1437173A, at Months 108 and 120 post-
vaccination and the assessment of re-vaccination with 2 additional doses administered 10 years after the
initial vaccination in study ZOSTER-003 in healthy subjects aged 60 years of age and older.
