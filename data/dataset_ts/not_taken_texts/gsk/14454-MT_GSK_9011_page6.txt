What were the main results of the study?
Part 1
What were the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed?
Researchers identified niraparib 200 mg + pembrolizumab 200 mg as the dose that could be
safely given to the participants.
Part 2
Researchers assessed each participantâ€™s cancer using physical examinations, scans, and
blood tests. Researchers measured the number of participants who had tumours that
completely disappeared (complete response) or tumours that became at least 30% smaller
after initiating treatment (partial response). This is together called as objective response
rate (ORR).
How many participants had complete response or partial response?
These results were studied for participants in Group 2A (53 participants) and for
participants in Group 2B (55 participants) as presented below.
