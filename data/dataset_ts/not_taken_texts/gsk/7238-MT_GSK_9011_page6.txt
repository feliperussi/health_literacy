What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
One serious side effect was reported during the study. One patient (less than 1%) from
the placebo group had a mini-stroke with no lasting effects. No patients in the
mepolizumab group reported serious side effects.
Headache was the only non-serious side effect that was reported by 3% or more of
patients in any treatment group. This was reported by eight patients (4%) in the
mepolizumab group and two patients (less than 1%) in the placebo group.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The study showed that adding mepolizumab to regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment
was better than regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment alone. Patients who received
mepolizumab had a reduction in nasal polyp size, nasal obstruction, and the risk of
having nasal polyp surgery. One patient in the placebo group had a serious side effect.
The non-serious side effects reported in the study were low in number and as
expected.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on mepolizumab in patients with bilateral nasal polyps have been
conducted and more are underway.
