Which medicines were studied?
During the study, patients were included in one of the following two treatment groups
by chance (randomisation). The patients switched the ESA, which they were previously
taking, with the study medicine(s) as shown in the figure below.
Medicines used in the study
Each patient received:
1. Daprodustat tablet once daily*
Daprodustat
2. Placebo (containing no active medicine) into a vein
(intravenously [IV]) once a week
Each patient received:
Darbepoetin
1. Placebo tablet once daily
alfa
2. Darbepoetin alfa IV once a week**
*Daprodustat was given as 4 milligram (mg) tablet for the first four weeks, the dose
could be raised or lowered every four weeks thereafter (dose ranged from 1 mg to
24 mg) to maintain the patient’s Hgb levels within a target Hgb range#.
**Darbepoetin alfa starting dose varied depending on which ESA a patient was
previously taking. At Week 2, the dose ranged from 10 micrograms (mcg) to 60
mcg. It could be raised or lowered every two weeks to maintain the patient’s Hgb
levels within a target Hgb range#.
#Target Hgb range = 10.0 to 12.0 grams per decilitre (g/dL).
Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is
called a double-blind study.
