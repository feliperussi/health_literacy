How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped study doctors learn more about possible treatments for COPD in
patients with COPD and heart disease or a higher chance of getting heart disease.
Between each of the four treatment groups, study doctors did not find a significant
difference in survival at the end of the study.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in patients with COPD are currently
ongoing. The results of these studies will also be available on GSKâ€™s Study Register after
the studies end and the results are analysed. The link is below.
