daily life. It is a short survey consisting of eight questions, with scores ranging from 0 to
40.
For patients with COPD, inhaled medicines are an important part of treatment. An
inhaler is a handheld device that delivers medicine(s) to the lungs. Patients with COPD
who need to take three inhaled medicines (triple therapy) may use two or three
inhalers (multiple inhaler triple therapy). GSK has developed the Ellipta inhaler that can
deliver three medicines via one inhaler (single inhaler triple therapy).
The main objective of this study was to see how single (Ellipta) inhaler triple therapy
impacts the wellbeing and daily life of patients with COPD, as assessed by CAT,
compared with triple therapy via multiple (non-Ellipta) inhalers (multiple inhaler triple
therapy). Researchers also assessed the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were put into one of the two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
The patients knew which treatment they received. This is called an open-label study.
Patients in both the treatment groups received one medicine each from the following
class of medicines:
• Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
• Inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA)
• Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)
An ICS is a medicine that reduces inflammation in the lungs. LAMA and LABA are
different types of bronchodilators (medicines that relax and open the airways in the
lungs).
