General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in October 2016 and ended in June 2021.
What was the main reason for this study?
Asthma is a long-term condition in which the airways in the lungs get inflamed and
become narrow. This narrowing can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and
shortness of breath.
Inhaled corticosteroids are among the most common medicines used to treat asthma in
children. They reduce inflammation in the lungs and lessen asthma symptoms.
However, they can slow down growth.
