AVA AVA and raxibacumab

Treatment groups
At four weeks, the amount of anti-PA antibodies in the two treatment groups was close
enough that researchers concluded that AVA protection was similar even when given
with raxibacumab.

summary on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (see link provided at the end of this

What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study medicines. Any medical
events including symptoms reported by volunteers in the clinical study are called
adverse events. These adverse events can be found in the scientific summary (see link
provided at the end of this document).
The study doctors record if they think any of these events may be caused by the
medicine. If the study doctor believes that the event was caused by the medicine, they
record this adverse event as a possible side effect. In a clinical study these are called
adverse reactions. A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life
threatening, requires hospitalisation, or results in death or permanent damage.
