The data from the study were analysed to compare the TQ+CQ treatment group to CQ
only treatment group. At any point within the six months following the start of
treatment, about three times more cases of malaria are expected for patients who
received CQ only treatment than for patients who received TQ+CQ treatment. This
treatment difference between the two groups was clinically and statistically significant.
Statistically significant means that the difference was not likely due to chance alone.
What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study medicines. Any medical
events including symptoms reported by patients in the clinical study are called adverse
events. These adverse events can be found in the scientific summary (see link provided
at the end of this document).
The study doctors record if they think any of these events may be caused by the
medicine. If the study doctor believes that the event was caused by the medicine, they
record this adverse event as a possible side effect. In a clinical study these are called
adverse reactions. A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life
threatening, requires hospitalisation, or results in death or permanent damage.
This plain language summary describes those side effects (adverse reactions including
serious adverse reactions) recorded by study doctors. The tables below show the
serious and non-serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% or more of patients
in any treatment group. Heart rhythm problem (Electrocardiogram QT prolonged) was
the only serious adverse reaction, all others were non-serious.
