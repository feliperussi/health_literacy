found in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the
end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
One patient in the danirixin 50 mg group had a serious side effect of pneumonia.
No patients in any other treatment group had serious side effects.
The table below shows the non-serious side effects reported by more than one patient
in any treatment group.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase II study. A Phase II study aims to collect information about the safety
of the medicine and may also provide early information about how well the medicine
works against the disease. This study showed that danirixin did not offer any benefit in
reducing COPD symptoms. The side effects reported in this study were similar between
the treatment groups.
