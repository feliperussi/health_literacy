Women were excluded from the study if they had:
• Specific, less-common types of ovarian cancer as assessed by the study
doctor.
• More than two tumour removal surgeries.
• Abnormal blood test results for more than a month after chemotherapy.
• Received a medicine similar to niraparib before starting the study.
• Any other disease(s) or taken any medicine(s), that the study doctor
thought would affect the results of the study.
Overall, 733 women were randomised. The average age was 61 years. The youngest
patient was 32 years old and the oldest patient was 88 years old.
At the data cut-off, 387 patients had died or their cancer had grown or returned.
