What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each participants’ cancer using physical examinations, scans, and
blood tests at study start and at the end of Year 3.
Researchers measured the number of participants who had tumours either completely
disappeared or appeared smaller on scans after starting treatment. This is called objective
response rate (ORR).
How many participants had tumours that completely disappeared or became
smaller on scans after starting the treatment?
These results were available for 47 participants as shown in the figure below.
What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may have
been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be different to
those in the Informed Consent Form or other documents related to the study medicine.
A summary of all events reported in this study may be found in the link to the clinical trial
results summary provided at the end of this document.
Side effects in this summary have been reported up to Year 6.
What were the serious side effects?
The side effects are considered “serious” if they cause death, are life threatening, cause
lasting problems, or require hospital care.
