Test results
Results for the urine test, heart health, blood pressure, and body temperature were
within acceptable limits.
Most blood test results were within acceptable limits. Blood test results for abnormal
(lower or higher than normal) levels of haemoglobin (oxygen-carrying proteins),
platelets (blood clotting cells), and white blood cells are shown for 34 patients in the
table below. Results were not available for one patient in the GSK2330811 300 mg
group.

More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
In this summary, side effects refer to those adverse events that the study doctor thinks
may have been caused by the study medicine, as shown in the figure below.
Difference between an adverse event and a side effect
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
