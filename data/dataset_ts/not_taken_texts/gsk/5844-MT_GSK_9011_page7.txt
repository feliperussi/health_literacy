Comments on the Outcome of the Study
What did this study tell researchers?
This study provides evidence that in patients 4 to 12 years old, the combination of
fluticasone propionate and salmeterol (in a single inhaler) results in no increased risk of
hospitalization, intubation, or death related to asthma compared with fluticasone
propionate alone. No patients required a breathing tube or died during the study.
This study was a Phase IV study. Phase IV studies are studying medicines that are already
approved in some countries.
This summary shows the results from one study. Other studies may have different results.
We would like to thank the patients who participated and their parents. The results of this
study will help answer important scientific questions about asthma in children.
Further Studies
Other studies of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in combination (in a single inhaler)
in children with asthma, have been conducted and more are underway. The results of
these studies will also be available on GSK’s Clinical Study Register after the studies end
and the results are analysed (see link below).
