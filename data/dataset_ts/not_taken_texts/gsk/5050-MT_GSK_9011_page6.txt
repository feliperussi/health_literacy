*Note: A drop in haemoglobin levels was not reported as an adverse reaction in 1% or
more of patients in any treatment group in this study, but it is considered an
important possible safety issue with medicines like tafenoquine. In this study, a drop
in haemoglobin levels was reported as an adverse event in 2% (2 out of 133) of
patients in the CQ only treatment group; 5% (14 out of 260) of patients in the TQ+CQ
treatment group; and 2% (2 out of 129) of patients in the PQ+CQ treatment group.
