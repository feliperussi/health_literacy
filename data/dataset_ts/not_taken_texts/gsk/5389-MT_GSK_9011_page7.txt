What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study medicines. They document
the side effects that are reported by patients during the study. If they believe that the
side effect was caused by the medicine, they note that as well. This plain language
summary reports adverse events that may be related to the study medicine. These are
called adverse reactions.
• An adverse reaction is a medical problem that develops during the study that
the doctor thinks could have been caused by the patient’s study medicine.
• A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life threatening,
requires hospitalisation, or results in death or permanent damage.
No serious adverse reactions were reported by 1% or more of the patients in any
treatment group. The serious adverse reactions reported by 5 or more patients in at
least one treatment group and the adverse reactions (serious and non-serious)
reported by 1% or more of patients in at least one treatment group are shown in the
tables below. The number of patients in the tables below includes all patients who
received at least one dose of the medicine. All of these patients were included as part
of the safety population. There are more patients in the safety population than in the
intent to treat population.
