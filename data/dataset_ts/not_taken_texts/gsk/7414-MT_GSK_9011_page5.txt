What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patientâ€™s lungs move air in and out of the body.
Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if lung function is stable, getting
better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air that a patient can breathe out in the first second when
asked to blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer).
Higher values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs and that lung function
1
is better.
Study doctors measured FEV values before patients took the study medicine(s) and at
1
multiple time points over 24 hours after taking the study medicine(s) on Day 1 and at
Week 12. Average of FEV at each of Day 1 and Week 12 was calculated for each
1
patient. FEV measured before taking study medicine(s) is called FEV at baseline. The
1 1
difference between average of FEV at Week 12 (after 12 weeks of treatment) and FEV
1 1
at baseline is called the Week 12 change from baseline in average FEV .

The Week 12 change from baseline in average FEV values from individual patients in
1
each treatment group were combined and averaged. These averaged values were
compared between the two treatment groups. The Week 12 change from baseline in
average FEV could be calculated for 551 patients who had both baseline and Week 12
1
values. The results are shown in the table below.

After 12 weeks of treatment, the difference in the Week 12 change from baseline in
average FEV between the two treatment groups was small. Researchers concluded
1
that both the treatments had a similar effect on the lung function (FEV values) of the
1
patients.
