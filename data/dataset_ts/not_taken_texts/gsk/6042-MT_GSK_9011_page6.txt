What were the side effects?
Adverse events can happen to people when they receive a medicine. Study doctors
record these events. A summary of all these events can be found in the scientific
results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
No serious side effects were reported by patients in this study.
Two non-serious side effects were reported by two or more patients in any treatment
group. The table below shows the number of patients (percent) who had these side
effects.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. A small number of patients took part in this
study, particularly in the treatment holiday group and treatment control group. The
number of patients with flares in these groups was low. The side effects reported in
