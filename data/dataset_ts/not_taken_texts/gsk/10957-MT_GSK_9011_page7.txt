What were the non-serious side effects?
Non-serious side effects were reported by 59 participants (84%) in the feladilimab +
docetaxel group and 24 participants (71%) in the docetaxel alone group. Non-serious side
effects reported by 10% or more participants in either treatment group are shown below.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that giving feladilimab + docetaxel did not improve overall survival
in participants with advanced NSCLC compared with docetaxel alone. The side effects
reported in this study were as expected.
Are there any plans for further studies?
No further studies with feladilimab are planned but other new treatments for NSCLC are
either underway or being planned.
