What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the
end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine(s). The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine(s).
Three serious side effects were reported in the study up to Week 12. One patient (less
than 1%) from the single inhaler triple therapy group had two serious side effects:
sudden failure of the lungs and worsening symptoms of COPD. One patient (less than
1%) from the multiple inhaler triple therapy group had a serious side effect of
abnormal rapid, irregular heartbeat.
