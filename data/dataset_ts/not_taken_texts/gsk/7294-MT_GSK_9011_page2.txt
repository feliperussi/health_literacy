three inhalers. Patients using many different inhalers may be more likely to make
mistakes.
What was the main objective of this study?
This study compared the number of patients who made at least one critical error while
using an inhaler, after reading the how-to-use guide (also called the Patient
Information Leaflet). For this study, a critical error was defined as a mistake that could
result in the patient receiving little or no medicine.
Which devices were studied?
A. ELLIPTA inhaler B. DISKUS inhaler
C. Turbuhaler D. HandiHaler
None of the inhalers used in this study were filled with medicines that would affect the
patientsâ€™ COPD. The patients took their regular medicine and did not receive any extra
medicine as part of this study.
