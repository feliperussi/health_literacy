Anti-mepolizumab antibodies
Long-term treatment with mepolizumab may cause the patient’s body to make
anti-mepolizumab antibodies. Study doctors checked the patients’ blood samples on
Day 1, Week 20, and Week 28. Anti-mepolizumab antibodies were found in the blood
sample of one patient (out of 102 patients) on Day 1. No patients had
anti-mepolizumab antibodies after Day 1.
More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
In this summary, side effects refer to those adverse events that the study doctor thinks
may have been caused by mepolizumab, as shown in the figure below.
