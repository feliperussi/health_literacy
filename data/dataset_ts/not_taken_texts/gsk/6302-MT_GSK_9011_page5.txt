Antibodies against whooping cough in pregnant women and newborns
Researchers measured 3 types of antibodies against whooping cough (called ‘anti-FHA’, ‘anti-PRN’ and
‘anti-PT’) in the cord blood.
The pregnant women who got the Tdap vaccine passed more antibodies against whooping cough to their
babies than those pregnant women who got the placebo (Figure 2).

Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) is a measure of the average amount of antibodies in blood.
The same 3 types of whooping cough antibodies were measured in the pregnant women (Figure 3). The
amounts of antibodies were 11 to 25 times higher after vaccination than before in the Tdap group. In the
placebo group, the amounts of whooping cough antibodies did not change.

Antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus in pregnant women
For diphtheria and tetanus, it is known that people are protected against the disease if the amount of
antibodies in their blood is above a certain level. This is called the protective antibody level.
One month after the injection, almost all women in the Tdap group had protective antibody levels against
diphtheria and tetanus. In the placebo group, 70.6% had protective antibody levels against diphtheria.
Against tetanus this was 96.6% (Figure 4).
