Patients with anaemia may be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs),
such as darbepoetin alfa. These agents trigger the body to make more red blood cells,
which leads to an increase in Hgb levels. There are other treatments in development
that are being tested in clinical studies. Daprodustat is a medicine that is being tested
to treat anaemia due to CKD.
Patients with anaemia due to CKD, who were on dialysis or planned to start dialysis,
took part in this study. Dialysis is a treatment that removes waste from the body and
filters blood when kidneys do not work well. Researchers wanted to see how well
daprodustat works in increasing and maintaining Hgb levels compared with
darbepoetin alfa in these participants. Researchers also assessed the safety of this
medicine.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1 of the 52-week treatment period, participants were included in one of the
following two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
• Daprodustat: Participants received daprodustat tablets by mouth once daily.
• Darbepoetin alfa: Participants received darbepoetin alfa as an injection under
the skin or through a vein once every two or four weeks.
The participant and the study doctor knew which treatment the participant received.
Which participants were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enrol (inclusion criteria)
and those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed below.
Men and women with anaemia due to CKD were included in the study if they:
• Were 18 to 99 years old.
• Had Hgb levels between 8 grams per decilitre (g/dL) and 11 g/dL on Day 1.
• Had planned to start dialysis within six weeks of study start or had started
dialysis no more than three months before Day 1.
• Were expected to receive dialysis for the duration of the study.
