Belimumab is a medicine that decreases autoantibodies. The main focus of this study
was to compare the safety of belimumab when added to regular SLE treatment with
regular SLE treatment alone. The safety was assessed by comparing the number of
patients who died or who had unwanted medical events (adverse events) which were
serious or of special interest.
Which medicines were studied?
This study is taking place in two phases. During the first 52 weeks (Year 1), patients
were placed in one of two treatment groups by chance (randomisation), as shown in
the figure below. Patients received either belimumab or placebo (no active medicine)
in addition to their regular SLE treatment. Neither the patients nor the study doctors
knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called the double-blind phase.
Study design
After Week 52, all patients continued their regular SLE treatment and could choose to
take belimumab, if approved by their regular doctor. The study doctors continued to
monitor the safety of the patients for 4 years (follow up phase).
