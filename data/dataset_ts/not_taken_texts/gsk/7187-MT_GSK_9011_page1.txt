General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in November 2017 and ended in December 2019.
What was the main objective of this study?
High levels of a type of white blood cell (eosinophils) can lead to a condition called
hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Eosinophils help the body fight infections. Too
many eosinophils may cause inflammation that can damage the bodyâ€™s internal organs.
Mepolizumab is a medicine that lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood.
The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of mepolizumab in
patients with HES. Safety was measured by recording the number of unwanted medical
