anthrax spores. Anthrax bacteria makes a substance called the protective antigen (PA).
AVA helps the body make anti-PA antibodies, which defend against anthrax bacteria.
Raxibacumab is a medicine which binds to PA and reduces the ability of the bacteria to
make a person ill. Raxibacumab is approved in the United States of America for the
treatment of inhalation anthrax in combination with antibiotics. It can also be used to
prevent inhalation anthrax when other therapies are not available or suitable. In some
circumstances, we may want to give people preventative treatment with both AVA and
raxibacumab at the same time, but this has not been studied in the past.
In this study, researchers wanted to learn if raxibacumab, when given with AVA,
affected the ability of AVA to protect against anthrax bacteria. The study also tested
the safety of AVA when given with raxibacumab.
Which medicines were tested in this study?
There were two treatment groups in this study (who were not infected with anthrax):
• AVA
• AVA and raxibacumab
Both AVA and raxibacumab were given as injections. AVA was injected just below the
skin of the upper arm. Raxibacumab was given through a vein in the arm as an infusion.
Below are the details of the treatment schedule for both treatment groups.
