How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that participants with advanced breast cancer and ovarian cancer
responded well to niraparib when given along with pembrolizumab. The study results
provided a better understanding that niraparib along with pembrolizumab can be used to
partially or completely shrink cancer cells. Researchers also found the combination
treatment of niraparib along with pembrolizumab to be safe.
