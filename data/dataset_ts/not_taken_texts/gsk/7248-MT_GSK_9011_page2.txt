One of the approved treatments for asthma is a combination of two inhaled medicines
(dual therapy). However, dual therapy may not be enough to control symptoms in
patients with moderate to severe asthma. GSK has developed a combination of three
inhaled medicines (triple therapy) by adding umeclidinium to the dual therapy.
Researchers wanted to see how well the addition of umeclidinium to dual therapy
improved patients’ lung function compared with dual therapy alone in patients who
had poorly controlled asthma.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were put into one of the six treatment groups by chance (randomisation). Four
different doses of triple therapy and two different doses of dual therapy were used in
this study (as shown in figure below).

Fluticasone furoate is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), an inhaled medicine that reduces
inflammation in the lungs.
Vilanterol is an inhaled long-acting beta agonist (LABA). Umeclidinium is an inhaled long-
acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Both, LABA and LAMA, are different types of
bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that relax and open the airways in the
lungs.
Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is
called a double-blind study.
