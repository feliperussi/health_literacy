General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in June 2018 and ended in December 2018.
What was the main reason for this study?
Asthma is a long-term condition of the airways. When the airways are swollen and
inflamed, they become narrow. This narrowing can cause coughing, wheezing, chest
tightness and shortness of breath.
For patients with asthma, inhalers are an important part of treatment. An inhaler is a
handheld device that delivers medicine(s) to the lungs. GSK has developed an inhaler,
called Ellipta, for patients with asthma.
