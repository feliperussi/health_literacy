What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each participant’s cancer using imaging, physical exams, and
blood tests. They recorded if the participant’s disease progressed or if the participant
died.
At Month 18, 62% of participants were alive with no disease progression.
More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summary

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine(s). The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine(s).
The side effects in this summary have been reported from Day 1 to the data cut-off.
