(LABA, a type of bronchodilator) with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS, an inhaled
medicine that reduces swelling and inflammation in the lungs).
Research has shown that taking oral corticosteroids (an oral medicine that reduces
inflammation) for a long time can reduce the bone strength. Bone strength is measured
by bone mineral density. In this study, researchers wanted to learn if inhaled
corticosteroids affect hip bone mineral density in patients with COPD.
Which medicines were studied?
This study compared a combination of an ICS (fluticasone furoate) and LABA (vilanterol)
with LABA (vilanterol) alone.
During the study, patients were put into one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation). Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which
treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
Medicines used in the study
Vilanterol Vilanterol 25 micrograms (mcg)
Fluticasone furoate and A combination of fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and
vilanterol vilanterol 25 mcg
Patients took one puff of the study medicine(s) through an inhaler each morning for
three years. An inhaler is a handheld device that is designed to deliver medicine(s) to
the lungs.
