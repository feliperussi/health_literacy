What were the overall results of the study?
Study doctors collected blood samples from all patients. They measured each patient’s
Hgb level on Day 1 and then every four weeks during the study.
The main objective of the study was to see whether daprodustat was similar to epoetin
beta pegol in maintaining patients’ Hgb levels during Week 40 to Week 52. The
patients’ Hgb levels at Week 40, 44, 48, and 52 were combined and averaged.
