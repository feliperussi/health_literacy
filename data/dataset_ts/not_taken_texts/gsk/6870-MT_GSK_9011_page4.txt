What were the overall results of the study?
The main comparison between treatment groups was to see if patients who continued
to receive long-term treatment with mepolizumab had a higher or lower risk of having
a severe asthma attack compared with patients who stopped taking mepolizumab and
received placebo instead. For this study, a severe asthma attack was defined as an
attack for which the patient needed additional treatment from the study doctor.
A calculation was used to estimate the risk (called relative risk) of having a severe
asthma attack during the double-blind phase. This risk value shows whether continuous
treatment with mepolizumab increases (risk value greater than one) or decreases (risk
value less than one) the risk of having a severe asthma attack compared with placebo.
The risk value was then converted to a percentage to show the degree to which
continued mepolizumab treatment lowered the risk of having a severe asthma attack
(relative risk reduction) compared with placebo.
