Patients with anaemia may be treated with certain medicines called recombinant
human erythropoietin (rhEPO), such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa. These
medicines are also called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). These medicines
trigger the body to make more red blood cells, which leads to an increase in Hgb levels.
However, they may also increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease
(problems that affect the heart and/or the blood vessels) in the patients. There are
other treatments in development that are being tested in clinical studies. Daprodustat
is a medicine that is being tested to treat anaemia due to CKD.
Patients with anaemia due to CKD who were receiving dialysis (a treatment that
removes waste from the body and filters blood when kidneys do not work well) took
part in this study. Researchers wanted to see how well daprodustat worked in
maintaining Hgb levels compared with rhEPO in these participants. Researchers also
assessed the safety of these medicines, including if taking daprodustat increased the
risk of a major cardiovascular problem (major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE])
compared with rhEPO.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, participants were included in one of the following two treatment groups by
chance (randomisation).
• Daprodustat group: Participants took daprodustat tablets by mouth once daily.
• rhEPO group: Participants received either epoetin alfa through a vein one or
three times a week or darbepoetin alfa injections through a vein or under the
skin once every one, two, or four weeks.
The participant and the study doctor knew which treatment the participant received.
The study ended when at least 664 participants had a major cardiovascular problem.
