What was the purpose of this study?
This was a Phase I study. Phase I studies are usually the first time a new
medicine or molecule is given to people. This study was designed to measure
biodistribution of an antibody that binds to a protein called albumin.
Biodistribution is where a molecule goes in the body.
Researchers will look at the results of this study, as well as other Phase I
studies, and decide whether additional studies are needed. Researchers want
to understand more about the safety of the antibody, how long it stays in the
body, and what other substances could be attached to it.
Which molecule was studied?
GSK3128349 isnâ€™t a medicine, it is a molecule. Scientists call molecules like
GSK3128349 albumin-binding domain antibodies or AlbudAb for short.
GSK3128349 attaches to albumin. Albumin is made naturally in the liver and
carries hormones and nutrients in the blood.

Medicine
(to be added in
future studies)
In this study, no medicines were attached to GSK3128349. Researchers
wanted to learn where GSK3128349 goes in a human body. They used a
radioactive label called 89Zirconium so they could see the molecule on scans.
The PET-CT scans measure the radiolabel. Researchers assumed that
GSK3128349 remained bound to the radiolabelled GSK3128349 throughout
the study.
