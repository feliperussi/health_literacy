How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Results of this study showed that in COPD patients the ICS part of the fluticasone
furoate and vilanterol combination medicine had a similar effect on hip bone mineral
density compared with vilanterol alone. The side effects reported in this study were
similar between the treatment groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on combination of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in patients with
COPD have been conducted. No further studies are planned at this time.
