What we found:
Side effects were similar in both groups, not serious and lasted only a short time.
The most common side effect at the injection site was redness for both vaccines (Figure 5).
The most common other side effect was fussiness and irritability for both vaccines (Figure 6).

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers, doctors and parents understand that:
Vaccinating pregnant mothers against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough did not affect the
ability of the 6-in-1 vaccine to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib or polio.
The whooping cough antibodies transferred from mothers to babies during pregnancy:
may protect their newborns from the moment of birth but also,
o
may reduce the babiesâ€™ ability to make their own antibodies against whooping cough.
o
The safety of the 6-in-1 vaccine in babies of vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers:
was similar,
o
was consistent with known safety information on this vaccine.
