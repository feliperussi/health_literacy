How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who received long-term mepolizumab, in
addition to regular asthma treatment, took part in this study. This study showed that in
patients who continued to receive long-term treatment with mepolizumab, the risk of
having a severe asthma attack decreased by 38% compared with patients who stopped
taking mepolizumab. The side effects reported in this study were limited in number and
non-serious.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma have been
conducted and more are underway.
