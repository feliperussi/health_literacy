General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in February 2015 and ended in June 2017. Study sites were in the
United States of America.
What were the reasons for conducting this study?
Anthrax of the lungs (inhalation anthrax) is a rare type of anthrax. It can develop if a
person breathes in anthrax spores. Anthrax spores are inactive forms of anthrax
bacteria. Once spores become active, anthrax bacteria can cause serious flu-like
symptoms. If inhalation anthrax is not diagnosed and treated quickly, anthrax bacteria
can grow and spread throughout the body. Untreated, inhalation anthrax can be
deadly.
When diagnosed early, medicines that fight bacteria, such as antibiotics, are effective
treatments. Other medicines are also used to help prevent and treat inhalation
anthrax. Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) can be used to protect against anthrax. This
vaccine may be particularly useful for people with a high risk of coming in contact with
