In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
No serious side effect was reported by more than one percent of patients in any
treatment group up to Week 12. Three patients (one each from the placebo group,
nemiralisib 50 mcg group, and nemiralisib 750 mcg group) reported a serious side
effect of worsening symptoms of COPD. The patient from the nemiralisib 750 mcg
group also reported low blood pressure. No patients in the other nemiralisib (12.5, 100,
250, and 500 mcg) groups reported serious side effects.
The table below shows the number of patients (percent) with non-serious side effects
that were reported by two or more percent of patients up to Week 12.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase II study. A Phase II study aims to collect information about the safety
of the medicine and may also provide early information about how well the medicine
works against the disease. This study showed that addition of nemiralisib to regular
COPD medicine for patients with moderate-severe worsening of COPD did not show
improvements in lung function. The number of side effects reported by patients in the
