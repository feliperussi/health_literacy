Which vaccines were studied?
Two GSK rotavirus vaccines were used in this study:
PCV-free rotavirus vaccine (without the PCV-1 fragments)
Currently used rotavirus vaccine (containing small amounts of PCV-1 fragments)
How was the study done?
Babies were divided into 4 study groups (Figure Blood samples were taken before the first dose
1) and received two oral doses of: and 1 to 2 months after the second dose. These
samples were used to determine the levels of
PCV-free rotavirus vaccine - Batch 1
antibodies against the rotavirus.
PCV-free rotavirus vaccine - Batch 2
The babies were observed for 6 months after the
PCV-free rotavirus vaccine - Batch 3 second dose for potential side effects (this was
called safety follow-up).
Currently used rotavirus vaccine

What were the main results of the study?
This report focuses on the results of the main goals of the study. All results may be found in the clinical
results summary.
Antibodies after different batches of the PCV-free vaccine
There were no meaningful differences in the levels of antibodies in babies regardless of which of the three
production batches they received (Figure 2). These results indicate that the manufacturing process
produced consistent vaccine doses across production batches.
