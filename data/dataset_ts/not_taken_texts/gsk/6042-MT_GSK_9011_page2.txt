Belimumab is a medicine that decreases autoantibodies. In this study, researchers
wanted to compare how well belimumab works in patients with stable low level SLE
who restarted belimumab after a six-month break (treatment holiday) with those who
received belimumab continuously (treatment control).
Which medicines were studied?
Patients who were included in a previous belimumab study, were placed in one of the
three treatments groups, as shown in figure below.
Study design
Patients in the treatment holiday group took a six-month break from belimumab
(holiday phase) following which they restarted belimumab for the next six months
(restart phase).
During the restart phase of the treatment holiday group and in the treatment control
group, patients received belimumab (10 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) directly
through a vein every month. Throughout the course of the study, patients continued
taking their regular SLE medicine. The patients knew which treatment they received.
This is called an open-label study.
