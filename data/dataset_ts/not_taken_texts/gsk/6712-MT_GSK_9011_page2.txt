Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a medicine that is used to treat chronic
hepatitis B. It works by controlling the amount of virus in the body. Doctors monitor
the amount of HBV in the body by measuring the levels of viral genetic material in
blood (HBV DNA levels). They also measure the levels of HBsAg and HBeAg in blood.
These are proteins found on the HBV.
Chinese participants who had chronic hepatitis B leading to liver damage but no serious
symptoms took part in this study. Researchers wanted to see if long-term treatment
with TDF slowed the worsening of liver disease due to HBV infection (disease
progression) and prevented liver cancer in these participants. Researchers also studied
the safety of TDF.
For this study, disease progression was indicated by either of the following:
• Worsening of liver function as assessed by an increase of two or more points on
a scoring scale.
• A life-threatening response to an infection of the abnormal fluid built-up in the
abdomen.
• Decreased rate of removal of waste substance (creatinine) from blood by the
kidney.
• Enlarged blood vessels in the lining of the stomach or food pipe that can cause
bleeding.
• Liver cancer.
• Death due to a liver disease.
Which medicine was studied?
Participants took TDF (300 milligrams) tablet once daily for 240 weeks. The participant
and the study doctor knew which treatment the participant received.
