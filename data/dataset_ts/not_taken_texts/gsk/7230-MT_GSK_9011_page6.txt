What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by belimumab and/or rituximab. The side effects in this summary
may be different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to
belimumab and/or rituximab.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the participant is
taking.
The side effects in this summary have been reported during the two-year study period.
Serious side effects
In this study, serious side effects were reported as fatal serious side effects and
non-fatal serious side effects.
One participant (less than 1%) in Group B had a serious side effect of pneumonia that
resulted in the death of the participant (fatal serious side effect). The study doctor
thought that this side effect may have been caused by belimumab and rituximab. No
fatal serious side effects were reported by participants in the other two treatment
groups.
