Overview
Why was this study conducted?
The 6-in-1 vaccine is commonly used to immunise babies against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough,
hepatitis B, Hib and polio. This was a study to see if responses to this vaccination were similar in babies
born to:
1. mothers vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (dTpa) during their pregnancy
2. mothers not vaccinated against dTpa during their pregnancy
What was studied? Who was in this study?
Antibodies formed against Healthy babies (285 girls and 316

compared two groups of babies
All babies were protected against

diphtheria and tetanus.
1) Babies of mothers vaccinated against In both groups more than 94% of
dTpa during pregnancy (dTpa group). babies were protected against
hepatitis B, Hib and polio.
2) Babies of mothers not vaccinated

The vaccine safety was similar in both
groups (dTpa and Control) and side
effects were not serious and of short
