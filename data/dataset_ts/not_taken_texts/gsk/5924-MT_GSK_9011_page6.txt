What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by belimumab or placebo, they
record this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by belimumab or placebo. In blinded studies, the doctor does not
know which study medicine the patient is taking. In some cases, side effects will be
assigned to placebo. The side effects in this summary may be different to those in the
Informed Consent or other documents related to belimumab or placebo.
Side effects were collected for patients who received at least one dose of belimumab
or placebo. An additional 48 patients from three sites in United States received at least
one dose of belimumab or placebo. These 48 patients (16 patients in the placebo group
and 32 patients in the belimumab group) were included in this summary, but not in the
assessment of how well belimumab worked.
During the double-blind phase, the only serious side effect reported by more than one
patient in either treatment group was pneumonia. Pneumonia was reported by four
patients out of 165 (2%) from the placebo group and one patient out of 331 (less than
1%) from the belimumab group. No other serious side effect was reported by more
than one patient in either treatment group.
