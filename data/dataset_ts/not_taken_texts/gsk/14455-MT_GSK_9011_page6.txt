What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may have
been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be different to
those of other documents related to the study medicine.
