What were the overall results of the study?
In this study, patients scored their COPD symptoms (shortness of breath, cough and
phlegm production, and chest tightness and chest congestion) once daily using the
Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS: COPD) tool. This tool helps measure
the severity of COPD symptoms, where higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.
For each patient, the difference between E-RS: COPD score in the week before starting
the study treatment (baseline) and Month 6 were calculated. This difference in
patientsâ€™ scores within each treatment group were combined and averaged to get the
change from baseline scores. A decrease in the average E-RS: COPD score at Month 6
compared with the baseline score indicates a reduction in COPD symptoms during the
study.
