often require surgery to remove polyps (nasal polyp surgery). However, polyps usually
return.
Mepolizumab is a medicine that reduces inflammation. Researchers wanted to see how
well mepolizumab works when added to regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment
compared with regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment alone. The objectives of the
study were to see if mepolizumab reduced nasal polyp size, nasal obstruction, and the
risk of having nasal polyp surgery. Researchers also studied the safety of mepolizumab.
Which medicines were studied?
During the study, patients were placed in one of two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation), as shown in the figure below.
Study design
Patients continued taking their regular bilateral nasal polyp treatment throughout the
study. Neither the patients nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which
treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
