What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
The side effects in this summary may be different to those listed in the Informed
Consent or other documents related to the study medicine.
In blinded studies, the study doctor does not know which study medicine the
participant is taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
The side effects in this summary have been reported during the one-year treatment
period.
No serious side effects were reported.
A non-serious side effect of yeast infection in the mouth and throat was reported by
one participant in the fluticasone furoate group. No non-serious side effects were
reported by any participant in the placebo group.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
The study showed that the effect of fluticasone furoate on growth rate in children with
asthma who had not reached puberty was small during the one-year treatment period.
Side effects reported in the study were limited and non-serious.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate in children with asthma have been completed and
one study is ongoing. No further studies are planned at this time.
