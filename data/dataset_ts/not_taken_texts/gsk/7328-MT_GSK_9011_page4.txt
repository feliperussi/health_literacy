What were the main results of the study?
The study compared the percentage of patients who responded to the study medicines
at Week 24. Patients were considered to have responded if their CAT score at Week 24
was at least two points lower compared with their CAT score at the start of the study. A
lower CAT score indicates reduced impact of COPD on patientâ€™s wellbeing and daily life.
The percentage of patients who responded to the study medicines was calculated for
3082 patients. Results are shown in the figure below.
