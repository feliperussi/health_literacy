General Information about the Study
Study Dates: The study started in November 2011 and ended in November 2015.
The Reason for Conducting This Study
This study was done to help answer an important safety question about long-acting beta-
agonists, a type of medicine to treat asthma. The question is whether children taking
inhaled corticosteroids together with salmeterol (in a single inhaler) have the same risk of
having uncommon but serious problems when compared with patients taking inhaled
corticosteroids alone. Serious problems include hospitalization, needing to have a tube put
down their throat to help them breathe (intubation), or death due to asthma.
Background
Asthma is a long-term condition of the airways, the tubes that carry air to the lungs. When
the airways are inflamed (irritated and swollen), they become narrow. This narrowing can
cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. When these symtoms
