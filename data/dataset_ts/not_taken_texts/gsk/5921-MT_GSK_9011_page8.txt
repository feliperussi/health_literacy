effects of special interest were reported by less than 1% of patients in either treatment
group.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study compared the safety of belimumab when added to regular SLE treatment
with regular SLE treatment alone in patients with SLE. The numbers of patients who
died or had serious adverse events in this study were similar between the two
treatment groups. The number of patients who died from infection-related adverse
events was higher in the belimumab group. Adverse events of special interest reported
in this study were similar between the two treatment groups, except for the numbers
of patients who had serious depression or allergic reaction to the study medicine which
were higher in the belimumab group.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on belimumab in patients with SLE have been conducted and more are
underway.
