Serious side effects
Serious side effects were reported by six participants (2%) in the daprodustat group
and one participant (less than 1%) in the placebo group. The only serious side effect
reported by two or more participants in either treatment group was vomiting. This was
reported by two participants (less than 1%) in the daprodustat group.
Non-serious side effects
Non-serious side effects were reported by 11 participants (4%) in the daprodustat
group and 13 participants (4%) in the placebo group. The table below shows the
number of participants (percent) with non-serious side effects reported by two or more
participants in either treatment group.

How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that daprodustat improved the Hgb levels in participants with
anaemia due to CKD. The side effects reported were as expected in patients with
anaemia due to CKD.
