What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study treatments. Any medical
events including symptoms reported by patients in the clinical study are called adverse
events. These adverse events can be found in the scientific summary (see link provided
at the end of this document).
Only one adverse event of cuts on both thumbs (laceration) was reported in Group 1.
The study doctor believed the event was caused by use of an inhaler (study treatment).
The adverse event was not life threatening; did not require hospitalisation; nor did it
result in permanent damage.
No adverse events were reported in Group 2.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results of this study will help doctors understand which inhalers are easier for
patients to use with less mistakes. Fewer mistakes could help patients breathe more
easily.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of the ELLIPTA inhaler in patients with COPD are currently planned and
some are ongoing. The results of these studies will also be available on the GSK Study
Register.
