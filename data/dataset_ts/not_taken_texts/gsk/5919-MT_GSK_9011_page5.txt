Geometric mean concentration (GMC) is a measure of the average level of antibodies in blood.
Note: the number of babies in each group is not the same as the number of babies who received the vaccine (Figure 1). This
is because only babies who had no antibodies before vaccination and who followed all relevant study procedures as planned
were included.
Antibody levels after the PCV-free rotavirus vaccine and after the currently used
rotavirus vaccine
Two measurements were done to compare the PCV-free rotavirus vaccine and the currently used
rotavirus vaccine. Researchers looked at:
The percentage of babies who developed antibodies against rotavirus after the second vaccine dose
and did not have them before vaccination (Figure 3).
The levels of antibodies after 2 vaccine doses (Figure 4).
In both cases, there was no meaningful difference between babies who got the PCV-free rotavirus vaccine
and those who got the currently used rotavirus vaccine. These results indicate that both vaccines offer
equivalent protection against rotavirus.
