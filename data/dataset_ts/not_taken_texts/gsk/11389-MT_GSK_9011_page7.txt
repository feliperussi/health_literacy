What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. In this summary, side effects refer to those
events that the study doctor thinks may have been caused by the study medicine.
The side effects in this summary may be different to those of other documents related to
the study medicine. A summary of all events reported in this study may be found in the links
to clinical results summaries provided at the end of this document.
A total of 115 participants received at least one dose of study medicine. Participants were
included in the feladilimab group if they had received at least one dose of feladilimab.
Otherwise, they were included in the placebo group. There were nine participants who
were randomised after GSK took the decision to stop study medicines. These participants
were included in the placebo group for presentation of safety results in this section. Side
effects were reported for these participants up to the time of data cut-off (April 2021). One
participant who was randomised into the study did not receive any study medicine and was
not included in the safety results.
The table below shows the number of participants who had side effects, based on the study
medicine received.
