Patients with anaemia may be treated with medicines that trigger the body to make
more red blood cells, which leads to an increase in Hgb levels. Daprodustat is a
medicine that is being tested to treat anaemia due to CKD.
Researchers wanted to see how well daprodustat works in improving Hgb levels in
participants with anaemia due to CKD. Researchers also assessed the safety of this
medicine.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1 of the 28-week treatment period, participants were included in one of the
following two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
• Daprodustat
• Placebo (no active medicine)
Participants took daprodustat or placebo tablets once daily. Neither participants nor
study doctors knew who received which treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
Which participants were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enrol (inclusion criteria)
and those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed below.
Men and women with anaemia due to CKD were included in the study if they:
• Were at least 18 years old.
• Had Hgb levels between 8.5 grams per decilitre (g/dL) and 10 g/dL on
Day 1.
