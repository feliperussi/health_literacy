Patients with poorly controlled asthma were put into one of the five groups by chance
(randomisation). The five groups were based on the inhaler information shared and
who could see that information, see figure below.

Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion

• Were taking fixed dose of an ICS and a LABA for three months before
starting the study.
• Had poorly controlled asthma before starting the study.
• Had their own smartphone, which was suitable to run the app.
