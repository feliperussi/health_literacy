The table below shows the number of patients (percent) who received at least one
dose of belimumab or placebo with non-serious side effects that were reported by
three percent or more of patients during the double-blind phase.
Number of patients (percent) with non-serious side effects that were
reported by three percent or more of patients during the
double-blind phase
Placebo Belimumab
165 patients 331 patients
Upper respiratory tract infection 4 (2%) 14 (4%)
Urinary tract infection 2 (1%) 13 (4%)
Inflammation in the sinuses 1 (less than 1%) 13 (4%)
Headache 5 (3%) 11 (3%)
Nausea 5 (3%) 9 (3%)
After Week 52, 117 patients originally randomised to placebo group and 242 patients
from belimumab group continued in the open-label phase. All 359 patients received
belimumab in this phase.
During the open-label phase, no serious side effect was reported by more than one
patient. No non-serious side effect was reported by three percent or more of patients
overall. The percentage of patients with side effects were similar regardless of previous
study treatment in the double-blind phase.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
In this study, the percentage of patients who self-identify as black race and who met
the required reduction in SLE symptoms was 7% higher in the belimumab group
compared with the placebo group. This difference was not big enough for researchers
to conclude that addition of belimumab to the patientsâ€™ regular SLE treatment was
better than regular SLE treatment alone. The side effects reported in this study were
similar between the treatment groups.
