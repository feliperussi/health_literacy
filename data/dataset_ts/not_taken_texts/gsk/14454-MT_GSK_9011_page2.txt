General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in April 2016 and ended in September 2021. All the study sites were in the
United States.
Which medicines were studied?
The two medicines studied were niraparib and pembrolizumab.
What was the main reason for this study?
Breast cancer starts in the lobes of the breast. Some breast cancer cells do not have certain
proteins like estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
on their surface. Such breast cancers are called triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).
Ovarian cancer generally starts in the ovaries. Both breast and ovarian cancers sometimes
spread outside of where they started to other regions of the body, often referred to as
advanced or recurrent cancer.
This study was conducted in participants who either had TNBC that had spread (later
referred to as advanced breast cancer) or ovarian cancer that had returned (later referred
to as ovarian cancer).
In this study, researchers looked if the combination of niraparib and pembrolizumab could
be safe in participants with advanced breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Researchers also
wanted to see if this combination could shrink the cancer cells either partially or
completely.
How was the study done?
This was an open-label study where both the participants and researchers knew who was
receiving which study medicine.
The study was conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 was the dose escalation study and Part 2 was
the dose expansion study.
