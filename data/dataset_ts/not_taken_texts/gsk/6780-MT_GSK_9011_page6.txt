How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Information from this study may help researchers to gain a better understanding of
how well AVA and raxibacumab work when given together for the treatment of
inhalation anthrax. The study also helps researchers know how well AVA and
raxibacumab are tolerated when given in combination.
