What were the overall results of the study?
The study doctors scored patients' SLE symptoms at the start of the study (baseline)
and at Week 52. The scores from three scoring scales were used to decide if the patient
responded to the study treatment. Patients were considered to have responded to the
study treatment if they met the required change in score on each of the three scales.
For this study, the percentage of patients who responded to the study treatment at
Week 52 was calculated. This is called the SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate. A
higher response rate indicates more patients met the required reduction in SLE
symptoms.
The baseline SLE symptoms for one patient from the belimumab group were not scored
and this patient was not included in the SRI response rate results. The results for the
SRI response rates for 447 patients with data that could be evaluated are shown in the
figure below.

Treatment groups
After 52 weeks of treatment, slightly more patients (7%) in the belimumab group met
the required reduction in SLE symptoms compared with the placebo group.
