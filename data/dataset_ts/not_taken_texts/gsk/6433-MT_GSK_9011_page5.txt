called adverse reactions. A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life
threatening, requires hospitalisation or results in death or permanent damage. In
blinded studies, the study doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, adverse reactions may be related to placebo.
This plain language summary describes those side effects (adverse reactions including
serious adverse reactions) recorded by study doctors.
The table below shows all serious adverse reactions reported in this study.
Serious adverse reactions up to Week 24
Placebo Umeclidinium
101 patients 205 patients
Worsening symptoms of
2 (2%) 1 (less than 1%)
COPD
Pneumonia 0 1 (less than 1%)
Non-serious adverse reactions were reported by fewer than one percent of patients in
either treatment group.
For further information about safety, including details about the adverse events that
the study doctors did not think were related to the study medicine, please see the
scientific summary using the link at the end of this document.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This information will help regulators make decisions about whether to approve
umeclidinium to treat patients with COPD in China.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of umeclidinium in patients with COPD are ongoing as of October 2018.
