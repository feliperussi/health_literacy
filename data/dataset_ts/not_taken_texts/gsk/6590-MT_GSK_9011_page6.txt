In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
No serious side effects were reported in the study.
Non-serious side effects were reported by 12 patients (22%) in the mepolizumab group
and 7 patients (13%) in the placebo group. The only non-serious side effect reported by
2 or more patients in either treatment group was injection site reaction. This happened
in 3 patients (6%) in the mepolizumab group and in 2 patients (4%) in the placebo
group.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study showed that mepolizumab, when added to regular HES treatment, worked
better than only regular HES treatment in reducing the number of HES flares in patients
with severe HES. Similar side effects were reported between the treatment groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies on mepolizumab in patients with HES have been conducted and more are
underway.
