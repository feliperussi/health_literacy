General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in March 2017 and ended in August 2019.
What was the main objective of this study?
High levels of a type of white blood cell (eosinophils) for a long period of time can lead
to a condition called hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Eosinophils help the body fight
infections, but too many eosinophils may cause inflammation that can damage the
bodyâ€™s internal organs. Patients with HES can have flares of disease worsening.
Mepolizumab is a medicine that lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood.
Researchers wanted to see how well mepolizumab works in reducing HES flares, when
added to their regular HES treatment, in patients with severe HES. For this study, a HES
