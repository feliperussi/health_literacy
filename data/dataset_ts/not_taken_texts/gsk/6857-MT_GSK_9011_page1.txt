General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in November 2016 and ended in July 2018. All study sites were in
Japan.
What was the main reason for this study?
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may develop anaemia. Anaemia is a
condition that arises because the blood does not have enough healthy red blood cells
or haemoglobin. Haemoglobin (Hgb) is a protein in the red blood cells that carries
oxygen to all parts of the body.
