Study group
The average percentage of Relvar/Breo Ellipta doses taken by patients in Group 1 was
12% higher compared with Group 5. This means daily adherence to Relvar/Breo Ellipta
treatment was better when the information about inhaler use was shared with the
patient and the study doctor or nurse (Group 1) than when the information was not
shared with either (Group 5). There was also better adherence in the other groups
(Groups 2, 3, and 4) when information about inhaler(s) use was shared compared with
when information about inhaler use was not shared (Group 5).
More information about the study results is available in the scientific results summaries
(links to those summaries are provided at the end of this document).
What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the
end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
