General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in November 2019 and is still ongoing. In April 2021, it was decided by
GSK that no further participants will enter the study and the existing participants will stop
receiving the study medicine, feladilimab. This is referred to as data cut-off in the summary.
However, participants could continue on the study and receive pembrolizumab. This
summary provides details only up to the data cut-off.
Which medicines were studied?
In this study, participants received one of the following two study medicines along with
pembrolizumab.
1. Feladilimab: It is a medicine that boosts the immune systemâ€™s reaction and helps
immune cells attack cancer cells. This may slow down the growth or return of the
cancer. It is not yet approved to treat any disease.
2. Placebo: has no active study medicine.
Pembrolizumab is a medicine that helps the body to use its own immune system to treat
cancer. It is approved in several countries to treat many types of cancer.
What was the main reason for this study?
Head and neck cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the head and neck region. When the
cancer spreads to the sites away from the head and neck region, it is considered metastatic.
Cancer that returns or keeps growing even with treatment is considered recurrent. Cancers
that are recurrent or metastatic are called advanced cancers.
Immune cells have a type of protein on
their surface called programmed cell
death 1 (PD-1). Cancer cells make a
protein called programmed cell death
ligand protein (PD-L1) that can attach
to the PD-1 protein and turn off the
immune cell. Cancer medicines can
attach to the PD-1 protein and block
the PD-L1 protein. This blocking
activity may help the immune system
