Participants
Study Site Locations
Study sites were located in Japan and South Korea.
Patients Included
Patients in this study were children who had been diagnosed with typical absence seizures
but had not started treatment (treatment naïve).
Each patient had to weigh at least 7 kg (15.4 pounds) and could not be in the study if they
had a history of getting a rash from other types of medicine or also experienced other
types of seizures.
Of the 20 patients in the study, 16 were from Japan and 4 were from South Korea. Thirteen
patients were girls and 7 were boys. The youngest patient in the study was 4 years old and
the oldest was 12 years old. The average age of patients in the study was 7.7 years old.
Investigational Medicinal Products Used
Medicines used
All patients in the study were treated with lamotrigine. There was no comparison with
other medicines and eveyone knew the medicine they were taking was lamotrigine.
Patients started with a low dose of lamotrigine. At each visit to the study doctor, the dose
was increased until the patient did not have a seizure when a trigger test for seizures was
used. The trigger test used in this study was having patients breathe quickly with shallow
breaths (hyperventilate). Hyperventilating can bring on an absence seizure. Each patients’
appropriate dose was confirmed by a normal brain wave pattern without seizures using
electroencephalogram (EEG) testing. Each patient was then given a dose one level higher
to continue for 12 weeks (the maintenance phase of the study).
Results of the Study
Results
An appropriate dose of lamotrigine was found for all 20 patients in the study. At the end of
the maintenance phase, 7 of the 20 (35%) patients remained seizure-free, as they had not
had a seizure when asked to hyperventilate.
