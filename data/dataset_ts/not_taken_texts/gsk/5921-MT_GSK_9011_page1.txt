General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in November 2012. Enrolment is closed, but the study was ongoing
when this summary was finalised.
What was the main objective of this study?
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a long-term autoimmune disease, in which a
type of white blood cell (B cells) produce proteins called autoantibodies.
Autoantibodies attack the bodyâ€™s own tissues and organs (for example, kidneys, heart,
lungs, or brain). Common symptoms include skin rash and joint pain.
