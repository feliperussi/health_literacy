Healthy kidneys make a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). Erythropoietin prompts
the bone marrow to make red blood cells, which then carry oxygen in the blood.
Patients with chronic kidney disease have diseased or damaged kidneys that cannot
make enough EPO. As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing
renal anaemia. Patients with low levels of red blood cells (or oxygen) may struggle with
daily activities like walking or climbing stairs. See figure below.
Renal anaemia
Patients with renal anaemia may be treated with medicines called erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents (ESAs) such as darbepoetin alfa or epoetin beta pegol. These agents
trigger the bone marrow to make more red blood cells.
Daprodustat is a medicine that prompts the body to make more EPO, and EPO prompts
the bone marrow to make red blood cells. More red blood cells lead to an increase in
Hgb and oxygen levels in the blood.
In this study, researchers wanted to see if daprodustat is similar to epoetin beta pegol
in maintaining Hgb levels in Japanese patients with renal anaemia, who were not on
dialysis at the beginning of the study (non-dialysis patients). Dialysis is a procedure that
removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop
working properly. This document provides a short summary of the results for non-
dialysis patients.
Researchers also wanted to see if daprodustat could maintain Hgb levels in Japanese
patients with renal anaemia, who were on peritoneal dialysis at the beginning of the
