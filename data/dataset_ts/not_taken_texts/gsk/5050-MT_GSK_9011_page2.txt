There are a number of malaria parasites. Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is one type of
malaria-causing parasite. The P. vivax parasites can live in a person’s liver even after he
or she feels better. While in the liver, the parasites are inactive and cannot be
detected. After weeks or months, the P. vivax parasites can return to the blood making
the person sick again.
What was the main objective of this study?
The purpose of the main part (Part 2) of this study was to see how well a new malaria
medicine (tafenoquine) worked in stopping P. vivax malaria parasites from causing
malaria sickness within six months after finishing treatment to clear the initial infection
(malaria-free).
Which medicines were studied?
This summary describes the results of the main part of this study (Part 2). An earlier
part of the study (Part 1) helped researchers choose the appropriate dose of the new
medicine. The dose selected in the earlier part was then used in the main part of the
study. For more information about the earlier part of the study, see the scientific
results summary on the GSK Study Register. The link is provided at the end of this
document.
Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• Chloroquine (CQ) only,
• Tafenoquine and Chloroquine (TQ+CQ),
• Primaquine and Chloroquine (PQ+CQ).
Patients in all three treatment groups received chloroquine (CQ) on days 1-3. CQ is the
standard treatment to remove P. vivax from the blood. CQ does not treat the inactive
liver stage of the malaria parasite. Some patients also received either primaquine (PQ)
or tafenoquine (TQ) to clear the inactive liver stage of the parasite.
No matter what treatment group patients were in, each patient received the same
number of pills (tablets or capsules) for 15 days. Neither patients nor study doctors
knew who received which treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
