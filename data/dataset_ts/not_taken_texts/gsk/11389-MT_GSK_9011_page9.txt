How has this study helped participants and researchers?
At the time of data cut-off, the study medicine group had stopped too early for accurate
conclusions to be made. The study results provided a better understanding of the effects of
feladilimab in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy on cancer cells. The side
effects reported were as expected for the type of treatments in this study.
Are there any plans for further studies?
Some studies of feladilimab in participants with head and neck cancer have been completed
and some are still ongoing. No further studies of feladilimab are currently planned.
