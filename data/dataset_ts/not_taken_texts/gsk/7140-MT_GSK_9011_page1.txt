General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in October 2016 and ended in December 2018. All study sites were in
Japan.
What was the main reason for this study?
Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) is often observed in patients following a spinal
cord injury or in patients with certain diseases of the nervous system in which the
nerves controlling the detrusor muscle in the bladder wall are damaged. This can cause
irregular contractions of these muscles and lead to leakage of urine (urinary
incontinence).
