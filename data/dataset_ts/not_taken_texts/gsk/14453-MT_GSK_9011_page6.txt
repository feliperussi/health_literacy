How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Participants with advanced ovarian cancer who responded to platinum-based
chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab took part in this study. Study results
provided a better understanding of how niraparib combined with bevacizumab can be
used to delay disease progression. The side effects reported in this study were as
expected.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of niraparib in participants with ovarian cancer have been conducted and
some are ongoing or planned.
