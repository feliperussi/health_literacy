The HBsAg and HBeAg proteins are found on the HBV virus. Doctors can monitor the
amount of HBV in the body by measuring the levels of these proteins in blood.
Entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are anti-viral medicines that
are used to treat chronic hepatitis B. For this study, patients were considered to have
responded to TDF if they achieved the required reduction in the blood HBsAg levels
after switching from ETV to TDF. The researchers also studied the safety of TDF.
Which medicine was studied?
As shown in the figure below, patients knew that they were taking TDF once daily for
96 weeks. This is called an open-label study.
