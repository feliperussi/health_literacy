Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women with renal anaemia were included in the study if they:
• Were 18 to 99 years old.
• Had Hgb levels between 8 grams per decilitre (g/dL) and 11.5 g/dL
before Day 1.
• Had haemodialysis (a treatment that filters blood and removes
waste) three times or more in a week for at least four months
before Day 1.
• Had been taking an ESA for at least three months before Day 1.
Men and women were excluded from the study if they had:
• A planned kidney transplant.
• Uncontrolled high blood pressure.
• A heart attack, stroke, or ministroke at least three months before
Day 1.
• Another disease that could lead to anaemia.
• Stomach and intestinal bleeding at least three months before
Day 1.
• Any other disease(s), abnormal test results, or other medication
use that would put the patient at unacceptable risk or affect the
results of the study.
Overall, 407 patients were randomised. The study included 230 men (57%) and
177 women (43%). The average age was 58 years. The youngest patient was 21 years
old and the oldest patient was 90 years old.
