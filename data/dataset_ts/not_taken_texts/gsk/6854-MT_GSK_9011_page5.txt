What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patientâ€™s lungs move air in and out of the body.
Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if lung function is stable, getting
better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air that a patient can breathe out in the first second when
asked to blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer).
Higher values of FEV mean more air is flowing out of the lungs and that lung function
1
is better. FEV is measured in millilitres (mL).
1
Study doctors measured the FEV values of the patients during the study. The
1
difference between the FEV at the beginning of the study (baseline FEV ) and after
1 1
24 weeks of treatment is called the Week 24 change from baseline in FEV .
1
The Week 24 change from baseline in FEV values from individual patients in each
1
treatment group were combined and averaged. These averaged values were compared
between the three treatment groups. Out of the 2425 patients, the Week 24 change
from baseline in FEV could be calculated for 1966 patients who had both baseline and
1
week 24 values measured. The results are shown in the table below.

After 24 weeks of treatment, the improvement in the average FEV of patients in the
1
umeclidinium and vilanterol combination group was higher compared with each of the
other two treatment groups. The differences in average FEV between umeclidinium
1
and vilanterol combination group and the other two treatment groups were
statistically significant. This means that the difference was not likely due to chance
alone.
