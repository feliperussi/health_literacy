How was the study done?
This was a double-blind study which means neither participants nor study doctors knew
who was receiving which study medicine combination.
At the start of the study, participants were randomised into one of the study groups as
shown in the figure below. Participants were divided in a way that each treatment group
had similar numbers of participants with PD-L1 positive and negative cancers. This allowed a
similar mix of participants within each treatment group.
What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each participant’s cancer using physical examinations, scans, and
blood tests.
How long did the participants live after randomisation to treatment?
The overall survival (OS) is measured from the time of randomisation to treatment until
participants’ death.
The median OS was calculated in months for all participants and PD-L1 positive participants
at the data cut-off. Median is the number in the middle of the ordered list, with equal
values above and below this number.
All participants:
The results were available for 52 participants in the feladilimab group and 55 participants in
the placebo group.
