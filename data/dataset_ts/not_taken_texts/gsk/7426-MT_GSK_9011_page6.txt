No serious side effects were reported by any patients in any treatment group in this
study.
During the first 12 weeks, no patients from the botulinum toxin type A (240 units)
group and one patient from the botulinum toxin type A (400 units) group reported a
non-serious side effect of muscle weakness. After Week 12, one patient originally
randomised to the botulinum toxin type A (240 units) reported a non-serious side
effect of swelling where the injection(s) was given and no patients from the botulinum
toxin type A (400 units) reported a non-serious side effect.

summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this document).
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. This study showed that giving botulinum toxin
type A (400 units) was more effective in treating patients with post-stroke upper limb
spasticity. The side effects reported in this study were similar between the treatment
groups. The results from this study will help government regulators make decisions
about the approval of botulinum toxin type A (400 units) in Japan.
Are there plans for further studies?
No further studies are planned at this time.
