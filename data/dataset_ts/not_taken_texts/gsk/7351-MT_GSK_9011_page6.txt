How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of triple therapy by
recording adverse events in Japanese patients with asthma. Three serious adverse
events were reported during the study; none of these serious events were caused by
the study medicines. The non-serious side effects reported in this study were limited in
number.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide, and vilanterol trifenatate
in patients with asthma have been conducted and more are underway.
