Antibodies 1 year after vaccinations
We measured levels of bacteria-killing antibodies We used both rabbit and human proteins to see
in the blood of babies who received the vaccine how many people had a level of 8 after
to see if it is working. A level of 8 is considered vaccination. We also wanted to find out how
enough to protect most people. Levels can be many people had antibody levels of 128 by using
assessed with tests using rabbit or human the rabbit protein. Levels of 128 are often used
proteins. Rabbit proteins have been widely used as an additional measure for assessing how well
for these tests because they are easier to get. meningitis vaccines work.
