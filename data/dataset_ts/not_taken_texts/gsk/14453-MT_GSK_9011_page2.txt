Niraparib is a medicine that can cause cancer cells as well as some healthy cells to die.
It may slow down the growth or return of cancer. Bevacizumab is a medicine that is
often used with other medicines to increase their effects in treating cancers.
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who responded to platinum-based
chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab (had partial or complete tumour shrinkage)
took part in this study.
Researchers wanted a better understanding of how niraparib combined with
bevacizumab can be used to delay the growth or return of the cancer (disease
progression) or death of these participants at Month 18. Researchers also studied the
safety of niraparib and bevacizumab.
Which medicines were studied?
As shown in the figure below, participants received niraparib once daily for up to three
years. They also continued receiving bevacizumab once every three weeks for at least
ten months.
Study design
Participants could continue in the study for up to three years or until their disease
progressed or the participant died. Participants with no disease progression up to the
data cut-off could continue treatment with niraparib.
