What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study medicines. Any medical
events including symptoms reported by patients in the clinical study are called adverse
events. These adverse events can be found in the scientific summary on the
ClinicalTrials.gov website (see link provided at the end of this document).
The study doctors record if they think any of these events may be caused by the
medicine. If the study doctor believes that the event was caused by the medicine, they
record this adverse event as a possible side effect. In a clinical study, these are called
adverse reactions. A serious adverse reaction is an adverse reaction that is life
threatening, requires hospitalisation or results in death or permanent damage. In
blinded studies, the study doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, adverse reactions may be related to placebo.
This plain language summary describes those side effects (adverse reactions including
serious adverse reactions) recorded by study doctors.
No serious adverse reactions were reported in this study.
The table below shows the adverse reactions reported by two or more children in any
treatment group.
