How do infants respond to a booster shot of a 6-in-1
vaccine if their mothers got the dTpa vaccine during
pregnancy?
GSK would like to thank all the infants who took part in this clinical
study, and their parents. We think it is important that you know the
study results. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud about
your important role in medical research.
