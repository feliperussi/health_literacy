Patients with COPD who need to take three inhaled medicines (triple therapy) may use
two or three inhalers. GSK has developed the Ellipta inhaler that can deliver three
medicines in one inhaler.
The main objective of this study was to compare lung function in patients with COPD
taking triple therapy (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol) using the Ellipta
inhaler with those taking tiotropium alone using the HandiHaler. The researchers also
assessed the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were put into one of the two treatment groups by chance (randomisation), as
shown in figure below.
Medicines and inhalers used in the study
Fluticasone furoate is an inhaled corticosteroid (inhaled medicine that reduces inflammation in the
lungs).
Umeclidinium, vilanterol, and tiotropium are long-acting bronchodilators (inhaled medicines that
relax and open the airways in the lungs).
Each patient received two inhalers, one contained study medicine(s) and the other
contained placebo (no active medicine). Neither patients nor study doctors knew who
was receiving which treatment. This is called a double-blind study.
