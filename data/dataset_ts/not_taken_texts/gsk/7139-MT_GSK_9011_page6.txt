How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This was a Phase III study. Phase III studies collect information about how well new
medicines work and how safe they are. This study showed that GSK1358820 was better
than placebo in reducing the number of urinary incontinence episodes. Compared to
the placebo group, more patients in the GSK1358820 group reported side effects.
Results from this study will help regulators make decisions about whether to approve
GSK1358820 for the treatment of OAB in Japanese patients.
