What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each patientâ€™s cancer using imaging, physical exams, and blood
tests. Study doctors measured progression-free survival by recording the time in
months from Day 1 until the cancer had grown or returned or the patient died.
The median progression-free survival was calculated for each treatment group at the
data cut-off.
