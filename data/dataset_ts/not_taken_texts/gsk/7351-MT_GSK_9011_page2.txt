The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of triple therapy
using an Ellipta inhaler once daily for a year (up to Week 52) in Japanese patients with
asthma. The safety was assessed by comparing the number of patients who had
unwanted medical events (adverse events).
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were put into one of the two treatment groups based on the dose of asthma
medicines they were taking before starting the study (see figure below).
Medicines and inhalers used in the study
Fluticasone furoate is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a medicine that reduces inflammation
in the lungs.
Vilanterol trifenatate is an inhaled long-acting beta agonist (LABA). Umeclidinium bromide is
an inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Both, LABA and LAMA, are different
types of bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that relax and open the airways in
the lungs.
