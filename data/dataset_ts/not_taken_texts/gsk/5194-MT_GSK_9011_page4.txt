Description of Adverse Reactions and Their Frequency
Adverse Reactions
Researchers collect information about the safety of study medicines.
• An adverse reaction means a medical problem that develops during the study that
the doctor thinks could have been caused by the patient’s study medicine.
• A serious adverse reaction means an adverse reaction that is life threatening,
requires hospitalization, or results in death or permanent damage.
For blinded studies, the study doctor does not know if the patient is receiving placebo or
an active medicine. In some cases, adverse reactions will be assigned to placebo.
Table 2 shows the serious adverse reactions reported by one or more patients.
