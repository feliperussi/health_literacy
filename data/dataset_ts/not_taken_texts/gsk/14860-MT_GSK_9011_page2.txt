General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in April 2015 and ended in August 2021.
Which medicine was studied?
In this study, each participant received niraparib capsules (300 milligrams) once daily.
What was the main reason for this study?
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or the
peritoneum in women. The inner lining of the abdomen is called peritoneum and the tubes
that connect the ovaries to the uterus is called fallopian tubes. Advanced ovarian cancer is a
cancer in the ovaries that has spread to other organs of the body.
Some people may have genetic changes called mutations in their cancer cells. These
changes make it difficult for the cancer cells to repair by themselves when they get
damaged. This reduced ability is called homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Before
the participants took part in the study, a genetic test of their cancer samples was done to
find out whether the participants had a harmful breast cancer (BRCA) gene.
Participants with advanced HRD positive ovarian cancer with or without BRCA gene took
part in the study. Participants also had received three or four chemotherapy courses and
had responded to the platinum-based chemotherapy (partial or complete tumour
shrinkage).
In this study, researchers wanted to see if niraparib could shrink the cancer cells partially or
completely. Researchers also studied the safety of niraparib.
