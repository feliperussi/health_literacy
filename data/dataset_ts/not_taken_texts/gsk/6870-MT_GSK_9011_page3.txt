Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women were included in the study if they had taken part in previous
mepolizumab studies for severe eosinophilic asthma and were:
• Receiving continuous mepolizumab treatment for at least three years
(with no gap more than 12 weeks) before randomisation.
• Taking regular asthma treatment for at least 12 weeks before starting
the study and planned to continue taking it during the study.
Men and women were excluded from the study if they:
• Were withdrawn from any of the previous mepolizumab studies for
safety reasons.
• Had poor health at the end of previous studies.
• Had any heart-related problem.
• Had cancer, including those who had been cancer free for less than one
year before starting the study.
• Received any other medicine(s) that the study doctor thought would
affect the results of the study.
Overall, 295 patients were randomised and received at least one dose of the study
medicine. The study included 122 (41%) men and 173 (59%) women. The average age
was 56 years. The youngest patient was 17 years old and the oldest patient was
80 years old.
