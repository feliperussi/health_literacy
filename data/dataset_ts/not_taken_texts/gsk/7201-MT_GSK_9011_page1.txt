General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in March 2018 and ended in October 2020.
What was the main objective of this study?
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term disease of the kidneys. Some people with
CKD cannot make enough red blood cells, which contain an oxygen-carrying protein
called haemoglobin (Hgb). This condition is called anaemia due to CKD.
