Investigational Medicinal Products Used
Medicines used
An inhaled corticosteroid is a medicine that reduces asthma inflammation and swelling of
the lungs, which helps to control asthma. The inhaled corticosteroid used in this study was
fluticasone propionate.
A long-acting beta-agonist is a medicine that relaxes (opens/dilates) the airways to make
breathing easier. The long-acting beta-agonist used in this study was salmeterol.
The patients in the study had an equal chance, like flipping a coin, of being placed into
either treatment Group A or treatment Group B. This equal chance is because of a process
called randomization.
• Group A – patients who took two medicines (fluticasone propionate 100 or 250
micrograms and salmeterol 50 micrograms) in a single inhaler twice daily.
• Group B – patients who took one medicine (fluticasone propionate 100 or 250
micrograms) in an inhaler twice daily.
An inhaler is a medical device which delivers medicine straight to the lungs by breathing in
the medicine. The inhalers looked the same for both groups to ensure that patients and
study staff did not know which treatment each patient was taking (this is called a double-
blinded study).
Patients in Groups A and B took their medicine twice every day for 6 months. Patients
received the higher or lower dose depending on the severity of their asthma.
The medicines in this study work in different ways to treat the two main symptoms of
asthma (inflammation and tightening of the airways).
