used the Ellipta inhaler correctly, without any help, was calculated. Among the children
who used it correctly, the percentage of children who rated the Ellipta inhaler easy to
use was also calculated.
In age group 2 (8 to 11 years), one child out of 134 children did not continue in the
study until Week 4. Results are shown for 221 children in the figure below.
Number and percentage of children who used the Ellipta inhaler
correctly and rated it easy to use at Week 4
After 4 weeks of Ellipta inhaler use, more than 90% of the children from both age
groups used the inhaler correctly. Of these, 98% of the children rated it easy to use in
both age groups.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
