in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by belimumab or placebo. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
Side effects reported during double-blind phase
Serious side effects were reported by 24 patients (11%) in the belimumab group and
26 patients (12%) in the placebo group. The table below shows the number of patients
(percent) with serious side effects that were reported by one percent or more of
patients.

Of the patients who reported serious side effects during the double blind phase, three
patients in each of the treatment groups reported side effects that led to death (fatal
side effects).
• Belimumab: Two patients had pneumonia and one patient had severe shortness
of breath and high blood pressure.
• Placebo: One patient had blood poisoning (sepsis), one patient had a disorder
that affects the brain, and one patient had a seizure.
