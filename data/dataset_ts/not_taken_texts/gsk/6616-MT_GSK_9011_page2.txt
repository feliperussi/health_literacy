People with anaemia may be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs),
such as darbepoetin alfa. These agents trigger the body to make more red blood cells,
which leads to an increase in Hgb levels. However, these agents may also increase the
risk of developing cardiovascular disease (problems that affect the heart and/or the
blood vessels). There are other treatments in development that are being tested in
clinical studies. Daprodustat is a medicine that is being tested to treat anaemia due to
CKD.
People with anaemia due to CKD who were not on dialysis took part in this study.
Dialysis is a treatment that removes waste from the body and filters blood when
kidneys do not work well. Researchers wanted to see how well daprodustat worked in
increasing and/or maintaining Hgb levels compared with darbepoetin alfa in these
participants. Researchers also assessed the safety of these medicines, which included
whether taking daprodustat increased the risk of a major cardiovascular problem
(major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE]) compared with darbepoetin alfa.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, participants were included in one of the following two treatment groups by
chance (randomisation).
• Daprodustat group: Participants received daprodustat tablets by mouth once
daily.
• Darbepoetin alfa group: Participants received darbepoetin alfa as an injection
under the skin or through a vein once every one, two, or four weeks.
The participant and the study doctor knew which treatment the participant received.
The study was planned to end when at least 664 participants had a major
cardiovascular problem.
Which participants took part in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enrol (inclusion criteria)
and those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed below.
