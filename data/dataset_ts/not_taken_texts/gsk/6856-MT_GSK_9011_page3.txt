summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this document).
Which medicines were studied?
During the study, non-dialysis patients were assigned to one of the two treatment
groups by chance (randomisation). The patients knew which treatment they received.
This is called open-label study.
Medicines used in the study
Patients received daprodustat tablet(s) once daily* for
Daprodustat
52 weeks.
Epoetin beta Patients received epoetin beta pegol via an injection below
pegol the skin once every two or four weeks** for 52 weeks.
*Daprodustat was given at a dose of 2 or 4 milligram (mg) for the first four weeks.
The dose could be raised or lowered every four weeks thereafter (dose ranged
from 1 mg to 24 mg) to achieve and/or maintain the patient’s Hgb levels within a
target Hgb range#.
**Epoetin beta pegol dose ranged from 25 micrograms (mcg) to 250 mcg once
every two or four weeks. The dose could be raised or lowered every four weeks to
achieve and/or maintain the patient’s Hgb levels within a target range#.
#Target Hgb range = 11 to 13 grams per decilitre (g/dL).
