What were the overall results of the study?
Lung function tests measure how well a patientâ€™s lungs move air in and out of the body.
Doctors can use the results of these tests to see if lung function is stable, getting
better, or getting worse.
One measure of lung function is forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV ). FEV
1 1
measures the amount of air that a patient can breathe out in the first second when
asked to blow as hard as possible into a tube connected to a machine (spirometer).
