Which medicines were studied?
As shown in the figure below, patients were placed in one of the two treatment groups
by chance (randomisation). Patients received belimumab or placebo (no active
medicine) directly through a vein.
Study design
This study took place in two phases. During the first 104 weeks, neither the patients
nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a double-
blind phase. After Week 104, patients could continue in the open-label phase of the
study and receive belimumab.
