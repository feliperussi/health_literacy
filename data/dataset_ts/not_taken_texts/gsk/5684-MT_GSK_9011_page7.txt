How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study tells us that doctors can give babies both vaccines on the same day and get results like those
when the vaccines are given on different days. This could help make it easier for families by reducing the
number of trips to the doctor.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of the GSK rotavirus vaccine were planned or ongoing when this summary was written.
