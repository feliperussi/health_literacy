Danirixin is a medicine that decreases inflammation. It was tested to see if it could
reduce patients’ COPD symptoms. In this study, researchers wanted to see how five
different doses of danirixin worked in reducing COPD symptoms compared with
placebo (no active medicine), when added to patients’ regular COPD medicine(s). The
study also assessed the safety of danirixin.
Which medicines were studied?
During the study, patients were included in one of the six treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• Placebo
• Danirixin 5 milligram (mg)
• Danirixin 10 mg
• Danirixin 25 mg
• Danirixin 35 mg
• Danirixin 50 mg
Patients took either placebo or danirixin tablets twice daily for six months. Neither
patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a
double-blind study.
Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women were included in the study if they:
• Were between 40 to 80 years of age.
• Were current or former smokers.
• Had COPD with symptoms including long-term cough, increased
phlegm, and shortness of breath on most days for at least the three
months before starting the study.
• Had a history of moderate or severe worsening of COPD symptoms
(exacerbations), which required treatment and/or hospitalisation in
the year before starting the study.
