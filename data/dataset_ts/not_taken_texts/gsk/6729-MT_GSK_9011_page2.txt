GSK2330811 is a new medicine that may reduce inflammation and fibrosis.
The main objective of this study was to assess the safety of GSK2330811 in patients
with dcSSc. Safety was measured by recording unwanted medical events (adverse
events) and monitoring patients’ blood and urine test results. Study doctors also
monitored patients’ heart health, blood pressure, and body temperature.
Which medicines were studied?
This study had two parts. Each part had a 12-week treatment phase and a 16-week
follow-up phase. On Day 1 of each part, patients were placed in one of the following
treatment groups by chance (randomisation):
• Part 1: GSK2330811 100 milligrams (mg) or placebo (no active medicine)
• Part 2: GSK2330811 300 mg or placebo
In Part 1, four patients received GSK2330811 100 mg or placebo. When this smaller
group of patients completed the treatment phase, study doctors reviewed their safety
results. After the review, a larger group of 31 patients received GSK2330811 300 mg or
placebo in Part 2.
During the treatment phase, study medicine was injected under the skin of the thigh,
abdomen, or upper arm every two weeks up to Week 10. Neither the patients nor the
study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a double-blind
study.
