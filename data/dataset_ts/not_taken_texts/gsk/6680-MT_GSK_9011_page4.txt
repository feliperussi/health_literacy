What were the overall results of the study?
The main focus of the study was to see the percentage of patients who showed an
improvement in asthma control. Patients were considered to have shown an
improvement in asthma control if:
• their ACT score was 20 or more during the study
OR
• their ACT score during the study was more than three points higher than their
ACT score at the start of the study (baseline).
Improvement in asthma control was calculated for 502 patients who had a baseline
ACT score and at least one ACT score recorded during the study. The percentage of
patients who showed an improvement in asthma control are shown in the figure
below.
