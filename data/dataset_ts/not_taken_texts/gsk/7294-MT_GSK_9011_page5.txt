Where was this study done?
The study sites were located in two countries. A total of 122 patients from the
Netherlands and 37 patients from the United Kingdom were included in this study.
What were the overall results of the study?
Each patient read the how-to-use guide for each inhaler before using the inhaler. A
study doctor observed the patient and looked for any mistakes. If a patient made a
mistake, the study doctor showed them the correct way to use the inhaler. The patient
was asked to use the inhaler again, and the study doctor recorded any further
mistakes. The study doctor could show the patient how to use the inhaler up to two
times. The study doctor noted all the mistakes.
After reading the how-to-use guide, fewer patients made mistakes that were
considered critical errors when using the ELLIPTA inhaler compared with the other
inhalers in both study groups (see figure below). These differences were statistically
significant. This means that the difference was not likely due to chance alone.
