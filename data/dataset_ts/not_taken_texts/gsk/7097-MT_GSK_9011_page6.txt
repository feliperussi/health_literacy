How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers concluded that daprodustat was similar to epoetin alfa in maintaining Hgb
levels in patients with renal anaemia. The side effects reported were similar between
the treatment groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of daprodustat in patients with renal anaemia have been conducted and
some are ongoing or planned.
