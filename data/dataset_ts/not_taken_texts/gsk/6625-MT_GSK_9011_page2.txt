Reducing the severity of symptoms is important in the treatment of COPD. For patients
with COPD, inhaled medicines are an important part of treatment. An inhaler is a
handheld device that delivers medicine to the lungs.
Researchers wanted to see if nemiralisib, an inhaled medicine, reduced lung
inflammation and improved lung function in patients with moderate to severe
worsening of COPD. In this study, six different doses of nemiralisib were compared with
placebo (no active medicine), when added to patientsâ€™ regular COPD medicine(s)
(standard of care). The study also assessed the safety of nemiralisib.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were included in one of the seven treatment groups by chance
(randomisation), as shown in figure below. Three times as many patients were included
in the placebo group and nemiralisib 750 microgram (mcg) group compared with the
other nemiralisib groups.
Study Design
Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which study medicine. This
is called a double-blind study.
