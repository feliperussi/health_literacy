What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
No serious side effects were reported in this study.
Non-serious side effects were reported by 32 participants (16%). The table below
shows the number of participants (percent) with non-serious side effects that were
reported by three percent or more of participants in this study.

reported by three percent or more of participants
TDF
195 participants
Lower than normal levels of phosphorus in the blood 14 (7%)
Lower than normal levels of calcium in the blood 7 (4%)
Higher than normal levels of protein called creatine
5 (3%)
phosphokinase in the blood
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that long-term treatment with TDF slowed the disease
progression and prevented liver cancer in Chinese participants who had chronic
hepatitis B leading to liver damage but no serious symptoms. The side effects reported
in the study were non-serious.
