No specific non-serious side effects caused by rituximab or belimumab and rituximab
were reported by 5% or more of participants in any treatment group. The table below
shows the number of participants (percent) with non-serious side effects caused by
belimumab that were reported by 5% or more of participants in any treatment group.

How has this study helped participants and researchers?
In this study, the percentage of participants with their SLE under control was slightly
higher in Group B compared with Group A. This difference was not big enough for the
researchers to be sure that addition of rituximab to belimumab was better than
belimumab alone. The side effects reported were as expected in people with SLE taking
belimumab and/or rituximab. A higher number of participants in Group B had serious
infections compared with the other two treatment groups. However, the study doctors
did not think most of these were caused by belimumab and/or rituximab.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of belimumab in participants with SLE have been completed. Some
studies are ongoing or planned.
