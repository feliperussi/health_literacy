No serious side effects were reported by 1% or more of patients in any treatment
group.
The only non-serious side effect reported in 1% or more of patients in any treatment
group was shortness of breath. This happened in 29 patients (2%) in the single inhaler
triple therapy group and in three patients (less than 1%) in the multiple inhaler triple
therapy group.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The study showed that more patients with COPD taking single (Ellipta) inhaler triple
therapy had improvement in wellbeing and daily life compared with patients taking
multiple (non-Ellipta) inhaler triple therapy. The side effects reported in this study were
low in number and as expected.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol in patients with
COPD have been conducted and more are underway.
