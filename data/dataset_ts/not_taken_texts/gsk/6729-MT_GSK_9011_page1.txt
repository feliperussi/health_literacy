General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in June 2017 and ended in July 2020.
What was the main objective of this study?
An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the bodyâ€™s immune system attacks its
own tissues and organs. Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc), a type of systemic
sclerosis, is a rare and often serious autoimmune disease. Patients with dcSSc develop
inflammation and fibrosis (thickening and hardening of the tissue) that usually starts on
the skin of the hands, feet, and face. The fibrosis can affect blood vessels and later
spread to internal organs.
