Symptoms were scored once in the morning (before using the nasal spray) and once in
the evening (12 hours after using the nasal spray) as:
• None (0).
• Mild (1).
• Moderate (2).
• Severe (3)
The total nasal symptom score is the combined score of the above four symptoms, with
a maximum score of 12. An average of the morning and evening scores was calculated
for each patient. This was called the daily reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS).
The graph below presents the average daily rTNSS calculated at the start of the study
(baseline) and over the first two weeks of treatment.

Baseline daily rTNSS Over the first two weeks of treatment
A decrease in daily rTNSS means an improvement in nasal symptoms. Over the first two
weeks of treatment, study doctors observed a decrease in average daily rTNSS in all the
three treatment groups. In the placebo group, the average daily rTNSS decreased by
two. The average daily rTNSS decreased by 3.2 in both FFNS groups. This decrease in
both FFNS groups was statistically significant compared to the children who received
placebo. Statistically significant means that the difference was not likely due to chance
alone.
