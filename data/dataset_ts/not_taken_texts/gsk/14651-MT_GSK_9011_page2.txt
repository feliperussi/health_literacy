General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in October 2019 and ended in January 2022. All the study sites were in
the United States. This study ended earlier than originally planned as the researchers found
that very few participants responded to the study medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Niraparib and dostarlimab are the two medicines that were studied.
What was the main reason for this study?
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries. Advanced stage ovarian cancer
is a cancer that starts in ovaries and has spread to other organs.
Immune cells have a type of protein
on their surface called programmed
cell death 1 (PD-1). Cancer medicines
attach to this protein and may help
the immune system attack and
destroy the cancer cells. Some ovarian
cancer cells have a type of protein on
their surface called programmed cell
death ligand 1 (PD-L1). These are
called PD-L1 positive cancers.
Participants with advanced stage ovarian cancer who had previously been treated with
cancer medicines called bevacizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy took part in this
study. The participantsâ€™ cancer could be PD-L1 positive (with the PD-L1 protein) or PD-L1
negative (without the PD-L1 protein).
In this study, researchers wanted to see if niraparib and dostarlimab when given together
could shrink the tumours partially or completely. Researchers also assessed the safety of
this medicine.
