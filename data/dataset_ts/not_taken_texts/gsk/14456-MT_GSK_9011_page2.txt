Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who responded to chemotherapy (had partial or
complete tumour shrinkage) took part in this study. Researchers wanted to see how
well niraparib delays the growth or return of the cancer by measuring the progression-
free survival in these patients. Progression-free survival is the time until the cancer
grows or returns or the patient dies. Researchers also studied the safety of niraparib.
Which medicines were studied?
On Day 1, patients were placed in one of the following two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation):
• Niraparib
• Placebo (no active medicine)
Twice as many patients received niraparib compared with placebo. Neither the patients
nor the study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is called a double-
blind study.
Patients visited the clinic once every four weeks and could continue in the study for up
to seven years or until their cancer had grown or returned or the patient died.
Which patients took part in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Women with advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer were included in the
study if they:
• Were at least 18 years old.
• Had begun their last cycle of chemotherapy within 12 weeks of Day 1.
• Had partial or complete response to platinum-type chemotherapy.
• Met specific surgical criteria based on the stage of cancer.
• Had tumour tissue samples (biopsy) or were willing to undergo a fresh
biopsy before Day 1.
