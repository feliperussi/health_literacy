What was the main reason for this study?
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading disease caused by a virus. It
can cause lung inflammation, which leads to difficulty in breathing, resulting in very low
levels of oxygen in the blood. This condition is called COVID-19 related lung disease and
can be life-threatening. Patients may need a breathing machine called a ventilator to
help them breathe.
