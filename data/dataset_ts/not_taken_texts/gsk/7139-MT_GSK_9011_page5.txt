Two patients from each treatment group did not have values for the daily average
number of urinary incontinence episodes at both baseline and Week 12, so they were
not included in the results. Results are shown for 244 patients in the table below.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of all these events can be
found in the scientific results summary (see the link at the end of this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study treatment (study
medicine and/or the injections), they record this as a possible side effect (adverse
reaction).
In this summary, “side effects” refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study treatment. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
treatment.
Two patients from the GSK1358820 group had serious side effects up to Week 12. Both
patients had the serious side effects on Day 1. One patient had a study medicine-
related serious side effect of difficulty in speaking and another patient had an injection-
