What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors measured patientsâ€™ HBsAg levels on Day 1 (baseline), Week 4, and every
12 weeks during the study.
The main focus of the study was to see the number of patients (percent) who
responded to TDF at Week 48 compared to baseline. Results for 74 patients are shown
in the table below.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, it is
recorded as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
