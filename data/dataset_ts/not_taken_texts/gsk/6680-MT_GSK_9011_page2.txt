controlled and guide doctors’ treatment decisions. Doctors in China do not routinely
use the ACT.
The main objective of this study was to compare treatment decisions guided by
patients’ ACT scores with treatment decisions guided by doctors’ medical judgement
(usual care) in Chinese patients.
What was studied?
Clinics in China providing asthma care were selected for the study. These clinics were
classified into two study groups (see figure below). Patients knew which study group
they were assigned to and which treatment they received. This is called an open-label
study. Treatment prescribed to patients during the study could include GSK and/or
non-GSK medicine(s).
• Patients filled in the ACT beforeany treatment
Asthma Control Test decisions were made.
group • Treatment decisions were guided by the patient's
ACT score.
• Treatment decisions were guided by the study
doctor's medical judgement.
Usual care group
• Patients filled in the ACT afterthe treatment
decisions were made.
Every morning and evening, patients recorded their symptoms and the medicines that
they took in a diary card. Patients visited their assigned clinic every four weeks during
the 24-week study period. At each visit, patients completed the ACT. They scored their
asthma symptoms over the previous four weeks. ACT scores range from 5 to 25.
Patients with higher scores have better asthma control.
Which patients were included in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for patients who can enrol (inclusion criteria) and
those who can’t (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
