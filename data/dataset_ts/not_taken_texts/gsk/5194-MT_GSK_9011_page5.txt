patients with COPD.
This summary shows the results from one study. Other studies may find different results.
We would like to thank the patients who contributed. The results of this study will help
answer important scientific questions.
Further Studies
Other studies of fluticasone furoate and vilanterol in patients with COPD are currently
planned and others are ongoing. The results of these studies will also be available on
GlaxoSmithKlineâ€™s Clinical Study Register after the studies end and the results are analyzed
