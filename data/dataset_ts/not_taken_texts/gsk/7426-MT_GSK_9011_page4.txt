What were the overall results of the study?
The main objective of this study focused on the movement of elbow muscles. Study
doctors used the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) to measure the difficulty (resistance)
seen while bending a patientâ€™s elbow. This scale ranges from zero to four, where a
lower score means there is less resistance while bending the elbow.
Study doctors scored the elbow movements at the start of the study (baseline) and at
Weeks 2, 4, and 6. A reduced MAS score indicates an improvement in elbow muscle
movement. Patients were considered to have responded to the study medicine if their
Week 6 MAS score decreased by at least one point from baseline.
