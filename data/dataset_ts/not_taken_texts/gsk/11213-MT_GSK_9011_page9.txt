How has this study helped participants and researchers?
Researchers concluded that giving feladilimab along with pembrolizumab did not increase
the participantsâ€™ OS and PFS compared with pembrolizumab alone. Researchers
recommended to stop treating participants with feladilimab. The study results provided a
better understanding of the effects of feladilimab in combination with pembrolizumab on
cancer cells. The side effects reported were as expected for the types of treatments in this
study.
Are there any plans for further studies?
Some studies of feladilimab in participants with head and neck cancer have been completed
and some are still ongoing. No further studies of feladilimab are currently planned.
