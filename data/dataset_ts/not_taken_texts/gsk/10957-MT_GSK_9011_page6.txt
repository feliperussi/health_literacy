What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical problems (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may have
been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be different to
those in other documents related to the study medicine.
A summary of all events reported in this study may be found in the clinical results summary.
A total of 104 out of 105 participants received at least one dose of study medicine. Side
effects were reported for these participants.
What were the serious side effects?
The side effects are considered “serious” if they cause death, are life threatening, cause
lasting problems or require hospital care.
Serious side effects were reported by 11 participants (16%) in the feladilimab + docetaxel
group and 10 participants (29%) in the docetaxel alone group. Serious side effects reported
by one percent or more participants in either treatment group are shown below.
Fatal serious side effects of heart stopped beating and inflammation of lung cells were
