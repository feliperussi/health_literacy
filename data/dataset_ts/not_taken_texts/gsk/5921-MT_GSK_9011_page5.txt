Number of patients (percent) who had serious adverse events including
those who died during the on-treatment period
The numbers of patients who had serious infections were similar between the two
treatment groups. The numbers of patients who died in each treatment group were
similar. Despite this, there were more infection-related deaths in the belimumab group
(9 out of 10 patients) compared with the placebo group (3 out of 8 patients).
