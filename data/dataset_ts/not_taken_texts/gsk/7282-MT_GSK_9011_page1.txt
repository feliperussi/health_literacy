General information about the clinical study
When and where was this study done?
The study started in October 2017 and ended in November 2019. All study sites were in
Japan.
What was the main reason for this study?
Chronic hepatitis B is a long-term infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B
virus (HBV). It can lead to serious liver diseases such as liver failure, cirrhosis, or liver
cancer. Currently, there is no cure for chronic hepatitis B. The goal of any treatment for
chronic hepatitis B is to manage the HBV infection by fighting the virus and slowing its
ability to damage the liver.
