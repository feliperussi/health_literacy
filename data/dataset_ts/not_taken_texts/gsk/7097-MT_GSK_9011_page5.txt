What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
A total of 406 patients (270 patients in the daprodustat group and 136 patients in the
epoetin alfa group) received at least one dose of study medicine. Side effects were
reported for these patients during the 52-week treatment period.
Serious side effects
Serious side effects were reported by three patients (1%) in the daprodustat group and
four patients (3%) in the epoetin alfa group. No serious side effect was reported by
more than one patient in either treatment group.
