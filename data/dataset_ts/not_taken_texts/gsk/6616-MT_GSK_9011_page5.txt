What were the main results of the study?
Participants were assessed for change in Hgb levels and whether there was a risk of
developing a major cardiovascular problem.
Hgb levels
Researchers wanted to compare daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa in maintaining
participants’ Hgb levels from Week 28 to Week 52 (testing period) of the study.
Study doctors collected blood samples from the participants. They measured each
participant’s Hgb levels on Day 1 (baseline) and during the testing period. The
difference in the participant’s baseline Hgb value and the average Hgb value during the
testing period was calculated. This is called the change from baseline for each
participant.
The average change from baseline in Hgb levels during the testing period was
calculated for each treatment group. Results are shown in the table below.

Major cardiovascular problem
Study doctors recorded the number of participants who had a major cardiovascular
problem. For this study, a major cardiovascular problem included a heart attack, stroke,
or death. Researchers wanted to compare the risk of a major cardiovascular problem
between treatment groups during the study.
