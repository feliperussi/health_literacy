attack and destroy the cancer cells. Some head and neck cancer cells have the PD-L1 protein
on their surface. These are called PD-L1 positive cancers.
People with PD-L1 positive cancers may have different amounts of the protein on their
surface. Cancer cells with more PD-L1 protein are called PD-L1 highly positive cancers. The
effectiveness of the PD-1 blocking medicine can depend on the amount of PD-L1 protein on
the cancer cells.
Participants with advanced head and neck cancer with different amounts of PD-L1 protein
on their cancer cells took part in the study. Researchers wanted to know if feladilimab along
with pembrolizumab improved survival and delayed the growth or return of cancer.
Researchers also studied the safety of these medicines.
Who took part in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enter (inclusion criteria) and
those who cannot enter (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Men and women were included in the study if they:
• Were 18 years or older.
• Had advanced PD-L1 positive head and neck cancer.
• Had the main cancer around their mouth and throat.
• Were expected to live for at least three months.
• Had the PD-L1 status of their main cancer available.
Men and women were excluded from the study if they had:
• A high risk of bleeding from their cancer.
• Any major surgery within four weeks before starting the study.
• Any other serious medical problems apart from cancer.
