scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this

What were the main results of the study?
The main objective of the study was to compare daprodustat with epoetin alfa in
maintaining patients’ systolic blood pressure (SBP) after eight weeks (on Day 57).
Systolic blood pressure is the pressure that blood exerts against the artery wall when
the heart beats.
Study doctors measured each patient’s blood pressure over six hours on Day 57. The
average SBP was calculated for each treatment group.
The average SBP over six hours on Day 57 was 143 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) in
the daprodustat group and the epoetin alfa group.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summary (a link to the summary is provided at the end of this
document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
No serious side effects were reported during the study.
