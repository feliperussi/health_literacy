Patients with COPD who need to take three inhaled medicines (triple therapy) may
often use two or three inhalers. GSK has developed the Ellipta inhaler that can deliver
three medicines in one inhaler.
The main objective of this study was to compare lung function in patients with COPD
taking triple therapy via the Ellipta inhaler (single inhaler triple therapy) with another
triple therapy taken via two separate inhalers (multiple inhaler triple therapy). The
researchers also assessed the safety of these medicines.
Which medicines were studied?
Patients were put into one of the two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
Patients in each of the two treatment groups received three inhalers, as shown in
figure below.
Medicines and inhalers used in the study
Fluticasone furoate and budesonide are inhaled corticosteroids (inhaled medicines that
reduce swelling and inflammation in the lungs).
Umeclidinium, vilanterol, formoterol, and tiotropium are long-acting bronchodilators (inhaled
medicines that relax and open the airways in the lungs).
Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which treatment. This is
called a double-blind study.
