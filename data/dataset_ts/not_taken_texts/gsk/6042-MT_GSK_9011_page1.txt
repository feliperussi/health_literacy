General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in May 2014 and ended in December 2018.
What was the main reason for this study?
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a long-term autoimmune disease in which
proteins called autoantibodies are made in the blood. Autoantibodies attack the body’s
own tissues and organs. Common symptoms include skin rash and joint pain. Systemic
lupus erythematosus can also affect other body organs. Patients’ SLE symptoms vary.
Based on the severity of the symptoms, SLE level is classified as low, moderate, or high.
