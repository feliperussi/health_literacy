and could breathe with minimal or no need for extra oxygen, about one month after
receiving the study medicine (Day 28). Results are shown in the table below.

What were the side effects?
Unwanted medical events (adverse events) can happen to people when they receive a
medicine. Study doctors record these events. A summary of these events can be found
in the scientific results summaries (links to those summaries are provided at the end of
this document).
If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the participant is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be associated with placebo.
The side effects included in this summary are those reported by the participants during
the two-month study period.
Two participants who were randomised to the placebo group received otilimab by
error. Side effects for these participants were reported in the otilimab group.
