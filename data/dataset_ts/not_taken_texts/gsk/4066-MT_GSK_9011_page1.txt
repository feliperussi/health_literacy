General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in January 2014 and ended in March 2018.
What was the main reason for this study?
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term disease of the lungs that
makes it hard to breathe and gets worse over time.
Patients who need daily treatment for COPD often take an inhaled long-acting
bronchodilator (a medicine that relaxes and opens the airways in the lungs). If patients
experience sudden worsening of COPD symptoms (exacerbation) despite daily
treatment, doctors may prescribe a combination of an inhaled long‚Äêacting beta agonist
