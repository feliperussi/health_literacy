If the study doctor thinks that the event was caused by the study medicine, they record
this as a possible side effect (adverse reaction).
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine. The side effects in this summary may be
different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents related to the study
medicine.
In this study, side effects were collected from the first day of the treatment period to
12 weeks after the end of the treatment period.
• No serious side effects were reported.
• No non-serious side effects were reported by any patients in the GSK3772847
group. One patient in the placebo group had three non-serious side effects.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
Researchers could not draw any conclusions due to the small number of patients in the
study.
Are there plans for further studies?
No studies of GSK3772847 in patients with moderate to severe asthma with AFAD are
currently planned or ongoing.
