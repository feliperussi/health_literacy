in the lungs. Eosinophilic asthma is considered severe when symptoms are hard to
control, even when patients are taking asthma treatment.
Mepolizumab lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood to normal levels. It is used
together with regular asthma treatment to help control severe eosinophilic asthma.
Patients who were included in previous mepolizumab studies and received
mepolizumab in addition to regular asthma treatment for at least three years (long-
term) took part in this study. The purpose of this study was to see if patients who
continued to receive long-term treatment with mepolizumab were more or less likely
to have a severe asthma attack compared with patients who stopped taking
mepolizumab.
Which medicines were studied?
In this study, patients were placed in one of the two treatment groups by chance
(randomisation). As shown in the figure below, patients either continued receiving
mepolizumab or stopped receiving mepolizumab and were given placebo (no active
medicine) instead. Neither patients nor study doctors knew who was receiving which
treatment. This is called a double-blind phase.
Design of double-blind phase
If a patient had a severe asthma attack, the study doctor decided if the patient should
stop receiving study treatment. These patients could then choose to enter the open-
label phase of the study and receive mepolizumab until Week 52.
