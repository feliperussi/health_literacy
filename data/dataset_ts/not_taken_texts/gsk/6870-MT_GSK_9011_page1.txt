General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in January 2016 and ended in July 2019.
What was the main objective of this study?
Asthma is a long-term condition of the airways. When the airways are inflamed, they
become narrow. This narrowing can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and
shortness of breath.
Patients with eosinophilic asthma have increased numbers of a type of white blood
cells, called eosinophils. Eosinophils help the body fight infections and control some
diseases. Too many eosinophils may worsen asthma symptoms, causing inflammation
