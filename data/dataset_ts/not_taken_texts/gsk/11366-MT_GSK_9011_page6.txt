The table below shows the number of participants (percent) with side effects that were
reported during the study.

Non-serious side effects 40 (10%) 40 (10%)
Serious side effects
Dangerously low blood pressure caused by a life-threatening response to an infection
was the only serious side effect that was reported for 1% or more of participants in any
treatment group. This was reported as a fatal side effect in four participants (1%) in the
otilimab group and as a non-fatal side effect in two participants (less than 1%) in the
placebo group.
Non-serious side effects
Diarrhoea was the only non-serious side effect reported by 1% or more of participants
in any treatment group. It was reported by four participants (1%) in the otilimab group
and by none of the participants in the placebo group.
How has this study helped participants and researchers?
In Part 1 of this study, researchers concluded that the number of participants who were
alive and could breathe with minimal or no need for extra oxygen on Day 28 was
slightly higher in the otilimab group compared with the placebo group. Older
participants (between the age of 70 and 79 years) seemed to show more improvement
when treated with otilimab. However, there were not enough participants in this age
group to know if the effect was real. This was studied further in Part 2 of this study.
The side effects reported were considered as expected in patients with COVID-19
related lung disease.
