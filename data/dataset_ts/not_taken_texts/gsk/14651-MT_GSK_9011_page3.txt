Who took part in this study?
Studies have a list of requirements for participants who can enter (inclusion criteria) and
those who cannot enter (exclusion criteria). For this study, the main inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed below.
Women could take part in the study if they:
• Were at least 18 years old.
• Had advanced ovarian cancer with known resistance (medicine no longer
works) to platinum-based therapy.
• Had previously received platinum-based therapy and other cancer medicines
such as bevacizumab.
• Were capable of self-care as determined by a scoring scale before starting the
study.
Women were excluded from the study if they had:
• Worsening of cancer within 3 months after receiving platinum-based therapy.
• Received a medicine similar to niraparib before starting the study.
• Any major surgery within one month of study start.
• Known liver infection.
It was planned to include approximately 150 participants in the study. At the time of early
study termination, 41 participants had received the combination of niraparib and
dostarlimab during the study. The average age of the participants was 63 years. The age
range of the participants was from 35 to 77 years.
How was the study done?
This is an open-label study, which means that the participants and their study doctor knew
which treatment the participant received.
As shown in the study design figure below, from Day 1, all participants received niraparib
and dostarlimab.
