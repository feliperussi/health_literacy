beginning of the study (baseline FEV ) and after 24 weeks of treatment (FEV after
1 1
treatment) on Day 169. The difference between these two FEV values is called the
1
change from baseline.
The results from patients in each treatment group were combined and averaged. The
difference in average FEV change from baseline between the two groups was
1
compared. The results are shown in the table below.

umeclidinium group and placebo
After 24 weeks of treatment, the average lung function of patients in the umeclidinium
group improved, and it worsened for the placebo group. The difference in FEV
1
between the two groups was statistically significant. This means that the difference was
not likely due to chance alone.
What were the side effects?
Study doctors collect information about the safety of study medicine. Any medical
events including symptoms reported by patients in the clinical study are called adverse
events. These adverse events can be found in the scientific summary (see link provided
at the end of this document).
The study doctors record if they think any of these events may be caused by the study
medicine. If the study doctor believes that the event was caused by the study medicine,
they record this adverse event as a possible side effect. In a clinical study, these are
