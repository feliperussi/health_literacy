General information about the clinical study
When was this study done?
The study started in May 2016 and ended in November 2017.
What was the main reason for conducting this study?
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term disease of the lungs that
makes it hard to breathe and gets worse over time. Umeclidinium is an inhaled long-
acting bronchodilator (a medicine that opens the airways in the lungs). It is approved in
many countries for the treatment of COPD. However, umeclidinium is not yet approved
in China. More information is needed to understand how this medicine works in
Chinese and Korean patients with COPD.
