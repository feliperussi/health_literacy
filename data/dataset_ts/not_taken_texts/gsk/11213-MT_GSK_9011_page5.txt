How was the study done?
This was a double-blind study which means neither participants nor study doctors knew
who was receiving which study medicine.
At the start of the study, participants were randomised into one of the treatment groups as
shown in the study design figure below. Participants were divided in a way that each
treatment group had similar numbers of participants with PD-L1 highly positive and low
positive cancers. This allowed a similar mix of participants within each treatment group.
However, GSK decided to stop feladilimab treatment in April 2021 based on an early look at
the data while the study was ongoing.
What were the main results of the study?
Study doctors assessed each participants’ cancer using physical examinations, scans, and
blood tests.
How long did the participants live after randomisation to treatment?
Overall survival (OS) is measured from the time of randomisation to treatment until
participants’ death.
The median OS was calculated in weeks for all participants and PD-L1 highly positive
participants. This was calculated at the time of data cut-off, 17 months after starting the
study. Median is the number in the middle of the ordered list, with equal values above and
below this number.
All participants:
The results were available for 157 participants in the feladilimab + pembrolizumab group
and 156 participants in the placebo + pembrolizumab group.
