How was the study done?
This was an open-label study, which means the participants and study doctors knew which
treatment they received.
As shown in the study design figure, participants either received feladilimab + docetaxel or
docetaxel alone. Twice as many participants were included in the feladilimab + docetaxel
group as compared with the docetaxel alone group.
