What were the overall results of the study?
Researchers looked at the number of patients in each group who had died by the end
of the study and the time from the start of the study until they died. Patients were
counted if they died for any reason and not just because of COPD or heart disease. The
study continued until about 1000 patients had died. This is called an event-driven
study.
The number of deaths for any reason is listed in the figure below.

The number of deaths was highest in the placebo group. Numerically fewer patients
who received active medicines died compared with patients who received placebo.
These differences in the number and percentage of deaths were not statistically
significant. This means that any differences were likely to have been due to chance
rather than the study medicines. The risk of death over time (hazard ratio) between
each of the treatment groups was also not significantly different. Cardiovascular
disorders were the most common primary cause of death.
