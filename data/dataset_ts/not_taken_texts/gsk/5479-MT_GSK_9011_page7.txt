more of patients.

Side effects reported during open-label phase
After Week 104, 132 patients from the belimumab group and 123 patients from the
placebo group continued in the open-label phase. All 255 patients received belimumab
in this phase.
During this phase, no fatal side effects were reported. No serious side effects were
reported by one percent or more of patients. No non-serious side effects were
reported by five percent or more of patients.
How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study showed that belimumab, when added to regular lupus nephritis treatment,
worked better compared with regular lupus nephritis treatment alone. Similar side
effects were reported for both treatment groups.
Are there plans for further studies?
Other studies of belimumab in patients with lupus nephritis have been conducted. No
further studies are planned at this time.
