In this summary, side effects refer to those events that the study doctor thinks may
have been caused by the study medicine up to week 52. The side effects in this
summary may be different to those in the Informed Consent or other documents
related to the study medicine.
In blinded studies, the doctor does not know which study medicine the patient is
taking. In some cases, side effects will be assigned to placebo.
Fatal side effects occurred in eight patients (less than 1%) in the belimumab group and
two patients (less than 1%) in the placebo group. In the belimumab group, two patients
had two side effects each that played a part in their death. In line with the overall study
results, there were more infection-related fatal side effects in the belimumab group
than the placebo group.
The table below shows the fatal side effects.

Pneumonia 3 (less than 1%) 0

Tuberculosis in the lung 1 (less than 1%) 0

Cardiac arrest 0 1 (less than 1%)
Serious (non-fatal) side effects occurred in 80 patients (4%) in the belimumab group
and 59 patients (3%) in the placebo group. All serious side effects were reported by less
than 1% of patients in either treatment group.
Non-serious side effects of special interest occurred in 15 patients (less than 1%) in the
belimumab group and 26 patients (1%) in the placebo group. All non-serious side
