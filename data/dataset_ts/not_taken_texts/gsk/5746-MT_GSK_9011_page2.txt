The medicine given in this study was an inhaled corticosteroid called
fluticasone furoate. It was used through an inhaler, a handheld device that
delivers medicine directly to the lungs.
Fluticasone furoate had shown to control asthma symptoms in children who were at
least 12 years old. Children with asthma who had not reached puberty took part in this
study. Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature.
Researchers wanted to learn if fluticasone furoate slowed down the growth in these
children when treated for one year. They also assessed the safety of this medicine.
Which medicines were studied?
At the start of the treatment period, participants were included in one of the following
two treatment groups by chance (randomisation).
• Fluticasone furoate
• Placebo (no active medicine)
Participants received fluticasone furoate 50 micrograms (mcg) or placebo through an
inhaler, once daily in the morning for one year. Neither the participants and their
parents, nor the study doctor knew which treatment the participants received. This is
called a double-blind study. Participants were also given an additional inhaler, which
contained another medicine, to be used as needed if their symptoms worsened.
Participants also took montelukast tablets once daily in the evening throughout the
study. It is a medicine used to control and prevent asthma symptoms.
