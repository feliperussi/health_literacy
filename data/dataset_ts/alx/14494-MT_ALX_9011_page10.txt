Did any of the patients in this study have a serious adverse event?
Overall, 33 out of 58 patients (57%) had a serious adverse event. The most common serious
adverse event was a lung infection, called pneumonia, and high blood pressure. 3 patients (5%) had
pneumonia, and 3 patients (5%) had high blood pressure.
2 serious adverse events may have been related to ravulizumab.
Were there any other important safety findings in this study?
No meningococcal infections were reported during 26 weeks or 52 weeks
of treatment with ravulizumab.
3 out of 58 patients (5%) stopped taking part in the study because of the adverse events they had.
4 patients died while they were taking part in the study. The deaths were due to other ongoing
severe illnesses and were not thought to be caused by ravulizumab.
OUTCOME OF THE STUDY
During 26 weeks of treatment with ravulizumab:
- 30 out of 56 patients (54%) had a complete response.
- Blood parameters returned within a normal range approximately 12 weeks after the first infusion.
- 32 out of 47 patients (68%) had less severe chronic kidney disease.
- The majority of patients experienced an improvement in their quality of life.
During 52 weeks of treatment with ravulizumab:
- 34 out of 56 patients (61%) had a complete response.
- No meningococcal infections were reported.
The results showed that patients with aHUS who had never had treatment with a complement
inhibitor responded well to treatment with ravulizumab. Overall, the researchers found no safety
concerns about ravulizumab as a treatment for patients with aHUS.
