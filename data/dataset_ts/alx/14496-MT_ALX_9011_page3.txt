What treatments are available for PNH?
Ravulizumab and eculizumab (trade name: SolirisÂ®), known as complement inhibitors, aim to prevent the destruction of the red blood cells, improve common symptoms of PNH, and prevent life-threatening complications.
Complement inhibitors work by sticking to a protein in the blood called C5, which helps stop the red blood cells from breaking down.

What were the treatments used in this study?
There were 4 groups in the study. Each group got a different dosing regimen of ravulizumab. This means that different doses of ravulizumab were given at different times for the 4 groups during the study. The treatment was given by an infusion, which means it was administered directly into the bloodstream via a drip.

GROUP 1   | GROUP 2   | GROUP 3   | GROUP 4   
--------- | --------- | --------- | ----------
1400 mg on Day 1, then   | 2000 mg on Day 1, then   | 1600 mg on Day 1 and   | 3000 mg on Day 1, then

Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 had an end of treatment visit on Day 253, which was around 36 weeks of treatment. Patients in Group 4 had an end of treatment visit on Day 281, which was around 40 weeks of treatment.
