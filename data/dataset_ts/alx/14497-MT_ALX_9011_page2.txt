BACKGROUND

What are clinical studies?
Clinical studies aim to answer specific questions about new or existing treatments, procedures, or vaccines and involve patients with health conditions or healthy volunteers. Clinical studies happen in several phases from phase 1 to 4.

This study is a phase 3. Phase 3 studies look at the overall risks and benefits of a new treatment compared to the routine treatment or care for the condition being studied. In this study, ravulizumab (new treatment) was compared with eculizumab (routine care) in adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

What is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria?
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, also called PNH, is a very rare, lifelong blood disorder. In PNH, some or all of the red blood cells lack important protective proteins. Without these protective proteins, the body's natural defense system destroys the red blood cells. This process is known as hemolysis.

Red blood cell missing - Red blood cell attacked - Red blood cell destroyed

In patients with PNH, hemolysis is always happening and can result in serious health problems.

What are the symptoms of PNH?
The most common symptoms of PNH include feeling tired, difficulty swallowing, trouble concentrating or thinking, shortness of breath, stomach pain, dark-colored urine, and erectile dysfunction in men. The lack of healthy red blood cells, known as anemia or being anemic, is a serious complication of PNH, which often results in patients needing blood transfusions.

Life-threatening complications from PNH can include blood clots, kidney failure, and other organ damage.
