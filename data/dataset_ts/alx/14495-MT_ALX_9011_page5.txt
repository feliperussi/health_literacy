STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Who could take part?
To be able to take part in the study, patients had to meet the following requirements:
- Male or female, 18 years of age or older 
- PNH confirmed by blood 
- High levels of LDH
- Bone marrow sample confirmed by 2 blood tests

Patients were unable to take part if they had previously had treatment with ravulizumab or eculizumab, or if they were unwell due to a fever or infection.

Complement inhibitors increase a patient's risk of meningococcal infection. A meningococcal infection is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. This results in swelling around the brain and spinal cord or infections in the blood. To help prevent meningococcal infection, all patients needed to have had a meningococcal vaccination no more than 3 years before taking part. If they had previously had a meningococcal infection, they could not take part.
