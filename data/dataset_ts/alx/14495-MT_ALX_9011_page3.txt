What treatments are available for PNH?
Ravulizumab and eculizumab (trade name: SolirisÂ®), known as complement inhibitors, aim to prevent the destruction of the red blood cells, improve common symptoms of PNH, and prevent life-threatening complications.
Complement inhibitors work by sticking to a protein in the blood called C5, which helps stop the red blood cells from breaking down.

What were the treatments used in this study?
There were 2 groups in the study. Each group was given different doses of ravulizumab by an infusion. An infusion means it was administered directly into the bloodstream via a drip.

----------- | -------------
400 mg or 600 mg on Day 1, 400 mg on Day 8* | 600 mg on Day 1, 600 mg on Day 15, 900 mg on Day 15, then 1800 mg on Day 29
