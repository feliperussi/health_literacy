What serious side effects did patients have in this study?
Overall, 8 out of 26 patients (31%) had a serious side effect. The most commonly reported serious side effects were related to infections and blood disorders. All of the serious side effects resolved while the patients were in the study.

Were there any other important safety findings in this study?
Complement inhibitors increase a patient's risk of meningococcal infection. An independent group was in place to monitor all patients for any cases of meningococcal infection. There were 2 patients who had meningococcal infections during the study. The meningococcal infections resolved after treatment with antibiotics, and both patients continued their ravulizumab treatment. None of the patients stopped taking part because of the side effects they had. No patients died during their participation in this study.

OUTCOME OF THE STUDY
The results showed that ravulizumab lowered the patients' LDH level and reduced hemolysis. Patients experienced improved symptoms of PNH and overall quality of life. The side effects resolved during treatment, and all 4 dosing regimens of ravulizumab were considered safe and tolerable.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The information collected in this study was from patients with PNH who had never had treatment with a complement inhibitor. The information collected from this study helped the researchers find the best dose of ravulizumab to use in a larger study.

Before a treatment can be approved for patients to use, researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safe. If you have any questions about ravulizumab for the treatment of PNH, please talk to your doctor. You should not change your treatment based on the results of this study without talking to a doctor first.
