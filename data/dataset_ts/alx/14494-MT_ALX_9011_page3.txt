What are the symptoms of aHUS?
aHUS has different causes and can be unpredictable, making it difficult to diagnose. The most common symptoms include a lack of energy and feeling tired. Life-threatening complications can include kidney failure, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Some patients with kidney failure need dialysis or a kidney transplant.

What treatments are available for aHUS?
When the study first started, eculizumab (SolirisÂ®) was a commonly used treatment for aHUS. Eculizumab is a complement inhibitor. Complement inhibitors aim to stop microscopic blood clots forming, and improve the symptoms and life-threatening complications of aHUS. Eculizumab is given by infusion every 2 weeks. An infusion means the medicine is given directly into the bloodstream, through a vein, via a drip.

What were the treatments used in this study?
Ravulizumab is also a complement inhibitor, like eculizumab. Ravulizumab is given by infusion, but it lasts longer in the bloodstream so it is given every 8 weeks for most patients.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
What were the researchers trying to find out in this study?
The researchers wanted to see if ravulizumab could safely and effectively treat adults with aHUS who had not previously been treated with a complement inhibitor. They looked at how each patient responded to the treatment.

To do this, they tested the patients' blood to see if they had:
- a decrease in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH
- an improvement in their platelet count
- a decrease in creatinine levels

These are called blood parameters. They are described in more detail on the next page.
