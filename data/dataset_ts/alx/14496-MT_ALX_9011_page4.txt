PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
What were the researchers trying to find out in this study?
The researchers wanted to see if different dosing regimens of ravulizumab worked at treating symptoms of PNH in patients who had never had treatment with a complement inhibitor. They also wanted to see if the different dosing regimens of ravulizumab lowered the patients' LDH level and reduced hemolysis. The side effects of ravulizumab and how patients tolerated the different dosing regimens were also looked at.

The study had 2 parts. Part 1 started in January 2016 and ended in February 2017. This summary provides the results of Part 1, which is when all patients had received at least 36 weeks of treatment. The plan is for Part 2 to finish in 2022 and the results made available in 2023.

What was the main question?
Did the different dosing regimens of ravulizumab lower the patients' LDH level?

Were there any other important questions?
Did ravulizumab have an effect on the patients' red blood cells?
Were there any changes in the patients' symptoms of PNH?
Did any of the patients need a blood transfusion?
Did the patients' tiredness reduce or worsen?
Did ravulizumab improve the patients' overall quality of life?
