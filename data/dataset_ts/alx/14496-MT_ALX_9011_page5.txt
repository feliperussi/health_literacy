STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Who could take part?
To be able to take part in the study, patients had to meet the following requirements:
- Male or female, 18 years of age or older
- PNH confirmed by blood tests
- High levels of LDH confirmed by bone marrow sample
Patients were unable to take part if they had previously had treatment with ravulizumab or eculizumab, or if they were unwell due to a fever or infection.
Complement inhibitors increase a patient's risk of meningococcal infection. A meningococcal infection is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. This results in swelling around the brain and spinal cord or infections in the blood. To help prevent meningococcal infection, all patients needed to have had a meningococcal vaccination no more than 3 years before taking part. If they previously had a meningococcal infection, they could not take part.
