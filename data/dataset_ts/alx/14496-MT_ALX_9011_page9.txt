SIDE EFFECTS
How is the safety of participants in clinical studies monitored?
A side effect is any symptom or clinical finding that occurs during the study. For example, a participant might get a headache or have abnormal blood test results. Side effects can vary from person to person. A lot of research is needed to see which side effects the study treatment causes and which side effects happen by chance. So, researchers keep a record of all the side effects participants have when new treatments are studied.
Any side effect thought to be an important medical event, requires a person to go to the hospital, could be life-threatening, or causes death, is called a serious side effect. A serious side effect may or may not be related to the treatment the participant was taking.
