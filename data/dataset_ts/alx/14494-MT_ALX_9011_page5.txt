To be able to take part in the study, each patient had to meet the following requirements:
- Male or female, 18 years of age or older

Complement inhibitors increase the risk of potentially life-threatening meningococcal infection, which is caused by a germ called Neisseria meningitidis. To help prevent meningococcal disease, all patients had to be adequately vaccinated before receiving ravulizumab.

19 men and 39 women, totaling 58 patients.
Patients were between 19 and 77 years of age and from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
