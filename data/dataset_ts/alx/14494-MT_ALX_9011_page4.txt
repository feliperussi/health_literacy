LDH Levels Platelet Count Creatinine Levels
LDH levels show how many red blood cells are bursting. In aHUS, LDH levels are high.
Platelets decrease rapidly because they are "consumed" by microscopic blood clots. In aHUS, platelets count will increase.
Creatinine levels show how well the kidneys are functioning. In aHUS, creatinine levels are high.

If ravulizumab works, the patient's LDH level will decrease.
If ravulizumab works, the patient's platelet count will increase.
If ravulizumab works, the patient's creatinine level will decrease.

This summary shows the results for both 26 weeks and 52 weeks of ravulizumab treatment for 56 patients. It also shows information about the safety of ravulizumab for 58 patients.

Main Question:
