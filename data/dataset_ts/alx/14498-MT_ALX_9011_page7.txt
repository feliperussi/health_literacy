Answers to the other important questions:
What percentage of patients in each treatment group had breakthrough hemolysis* after 26 weeks of treatment?
If the difference in the percentage of patients who had breakthrough hemolysis between those who got ravulizumab and those who got eculizumab was less than 20%, then that meant that ravulizumab worked as well as eculizumab in preventing breakthrough hemolysis.

RAVULIZUMAB | ECULIZUMAB
------------ | ------------
0% | 5%
None of the 97 patients (0%) had breakthrough hemolysis. 5% of the 98 patients had breakthrough hemolysis.
The difference in the percentage of patients who had breakthrough 5% hemolysis between those who got ravulizumab and those who got eculizumab was 5%.

*Breakthrough hemolysis means an increase in LDH levels and a new or worsening symptom or a serious complication.

How did tiredness levels compare between the 2 treatments after 26 weeks of treatment?
