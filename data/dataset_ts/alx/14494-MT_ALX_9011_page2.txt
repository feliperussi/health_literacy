BACKGROUND
What are clinical studies?

Clinical studies aim to answer specific questions about new or existing treatments, procedures, or vaccines and involve patients with health conditions or healthy volunteers. Clinical studies are done in several phases, from phase 1 to phase 4.

This is a phase 3 study. Phase 3 studies look at the overall risks and benefits of a treatment. In this study, the risks and benefits of ravulizumab as a treatment for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome are being investigated.

What is atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)?

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, also called aHUS, is a rare disease that causes the body's natural defense system, called the immune system, to destroy red blood cells, causing damage to organs.

The word hemolytic comes from "heme" meaning red blood cells and "lytic" from the word "lysis" meaning to break up or burst. The word "uremic" refers to symptoms of kidney damage, and the word "syndrome" is used because multiple organs in the body are affected.

aHUS causes microscopic blood clots to form in the body, which block or slow the blood flow to the body's cells, tissues, and organs. The kidneys are the most common organ affected and often suffer the most severe damage.

What causes aHUS?

aHUS occurs when part of the immune system called the "complement pathway" does not work properly. This causes unstable movement of blood through the small blood vessels, which results in microscopic blood clots.
