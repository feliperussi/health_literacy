What treatments are available for PNH?
Ravulizumab and eculizumab, known as complement inhibitors, aim to block the destruction of the red blood cells, improve common symptoms of PNH, and prevent life-threatening complications. Complement inhibitors work by sticking to a protein in the blood called C5, which helps stop the red blood cells from breaking down.
