STUDY PARTICIPANTS

Who could take part?
To be able to take part in the study, patients had to meet the following requirements:
- Male or female, 18 years of age or older
- Confirmed diagnosis of PNH with 1 or more related sign or symptom
- Taken eculizumab for at least 6 months, and a blood test confirmed hemolysis
- Doing well

Any patient who never had eculizumab treatment or had been unwell due to a fever or infection could not take part. Any patient who had a hemolysis blood test result that was more than 2 times higher than the normal level could not take part.

Complement inhibitors increase a patient's risk of meningococcal infection. A meningococcal infection is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. This results in swelling around the brain and spinal cord or infections in the blood. To help prevent meningococcal infection, all patients needed to have had a meningococcal vaccination no more than 3 years before taking part. If they previously had a meningococcal infection, they could not take part.

How many patients took part?

98 men + 97 women = 195 patients

Patients were aged between 18 and 79 years.

Where was the study done?

The study took place in 52 study centers in 12 countries across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
