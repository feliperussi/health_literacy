In this study, the researchers wanted to compare how much acalabrutinib got into the blood when taken in 2 different ways and when taken with and without a drug called rabeprazole. Rabeprazole works by decreasing the amount of acid in the stomach. This means that rabeprazole might reduce the amount of acalabrutinib that can get into the blood.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were: 
- How much acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when taken in different ways? 
- Did rabeprazole affect how much acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood? 
- What medical problems happened during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if acalabrutinib improves the health of people who have COVID-19.

What treatments did the participants take? 
There were 3 treatments in this study. The treatment doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.

- Treatment 1: acalabrutinib in flat Coca-Cola as a liquid through a tube in the nose and rabeprazole as a tablet by mouth 
- Treatment 2: acalabrutinib in flat Coca-Cola as a liquid through a tube in the nose 
- Treatment 3: acalabrutinib as a capsule by mouth

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
