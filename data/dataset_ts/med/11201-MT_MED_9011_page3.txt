Clinical Study Results

What happened during the study?
The study started in September 2019 and ended in October 2019. Up to 4 weeks before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants to make sure they could join the study. The study doctors also:

- did a physical exam and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems
- measured the participants' blood pressure and took their pulse rate
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG

While the participants stayed at the study site for 12 days, the study doctors repeated most of the tests and measurements that they had done before the participants took study treatment. The participants also took 3 single doses of AZD5718.

Up to 7 days after the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants' health and did an ECG.
