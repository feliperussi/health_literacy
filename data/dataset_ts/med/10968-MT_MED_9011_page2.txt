Overview of this study

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat NSCLC. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got durvalumab, either alone or with another study drug. The other study drugs that the participants could get were oleclumab, monalizumab, or danvatirsen.

What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did durvalumab, when given alone or with another treatment, reduce the number of tumor cells in participants with non-small cell lung cancer?
Overall, the researchers found that the number of live tumor cells was reduced in some participants who received durvalumab alone or with another treatment. They also found that more participants who got durvalumab and another study drug had a reduction in the number of live tumor cells compared to those who got durvalumab alone. But, the overall number of participants who received durvalumab alone or durvalumab and another treatment was too small to know if the study treatments definitely reduced the number of tumor cells.

What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 45.8% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs during the study, also called adverse events. This was 38 out of 83 participants. The most common medical problem was fatigue.

More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
