Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat tumors. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.

Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form tumors, which can start in any part of the body.

The study drug, savolitinib, is being developed as a treatment for tumors. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how savolitinib acts in the body when taken with a drug called rifampicin.

Rifampicin is a drug prescribed by doctors to treat infections. It has also been shown to speed up the removal of certain substances from the body. So, the researchers wanted to learn if rifampicin speeds up the removal of savolitinib from the body. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How did savolitinib act in the body when taken with rifampicin?
- What medical problems happened during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know. Other studies are being done to find out if savolitinib helps improve the health of people who have tumors.

What treatments did the participants take?
This study had 3 parts. The participants took savolitinib during Part 1, rifampicin during Part 2, and both treatments during Part 3. The participants took each treatment as a pill by mouth.

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
