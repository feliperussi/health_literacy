What was the purpose of this trial?
This was a "Phase 1" trial. In this trial, the researchers wanted to learn how acalabrutinib works when given with obinutuzumab, rituximab, or venetoclax. They also wanted to know if the participants had any medical problems during the trial. The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were:
- How many participants who received acalabrutinib with obinutuzumab responded to treatment?
- Did the participants feel that treatment with acalabrutinib, when given with obinutuzumab, rituximab, or venetoclax, affected their symptoms and quality of life?
- How did the participants' overall health change during the trial?
- What medical problems did the doctors report as possibly related to the trial treatments?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other trials can be done to find out if acalabrutinib helps improve the health of people with CLL when given with obinutuzumab, rituximab, or venetoclax.
