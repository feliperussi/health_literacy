How did the different forms of AZD5718 act in the blood?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants throughout the study.
In these samples, the study doctors measured:
- The average total level of AZD5718 in the blood during treatment
- The average total level of AZD5718 in the blood at the end of treatment
- The average highest level of AZD5718 in the blood during treatment
- The total level of AZD5718 in the blood 24 hours after each treatment
Overall, the researchers found that the levels of AZD5718 in the blood were highest when the participants took Form 5. The researchers also found that overall, these levels were lowest when they took Form 4.
