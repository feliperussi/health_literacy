Did the different treatments affect the participants in other ways?

Researchers wanted to know if the study treatment helped participants' COPD symptoms and ability to do daily activities. To find out, the doctors asked the participants to complete a survey each time they came to the doctor for a study visit. 

At 24 weeks of treatment, the doctors compared the participants' survey answers to the answers from the first week. The doctors did this again over 24 weeks of treatment.
