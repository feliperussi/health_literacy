What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did dapagliflozin help prevent the participants' CKD from getting worse compared to the placebo?
- What medical problems happened during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before dapagliflozin can be approved to help improve the health of people who have CKD.

What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take a drug are actually caused by the drug. The participants also continued taking any CKD treatments they were taking before the study started.

Both dapagliflozin and the placebo were taken as tablets by mouth. The treatment doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.

This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking.

A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.

Of the 4,304 participants who joined the study, 3 participants in each treatment group left the study before receiving study treatment. So, the chart below includes 4,298 participants.
