Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with HFpEF. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about how dapagliflozin works in people with HFpEF. Researchers already did studies that showed dapagliflozin worked for people with another type of heart failure.
The researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin improved how a large number of participants with HFpEF felt and functioned in their everyday lives. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
HFpEF happens when the heart can pump normally or nearly normally but becomes too stiff to fill properly. This means that the blood collects in the lungs and in the rest of the body.
Heart failure is a long-lasting condition that can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, and swelling of certain tissues. In serious cases of heart failure, there is an increased risk of other heart problems, and of death.
The study treatment, dapagliflozin, is used as a treatment for people with type 2 diabetes and people with heart failure caused by a weak heart. Researchers think dapagliflozin could also help people with HFpEF.
