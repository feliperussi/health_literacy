Did the participants' safety results change during the study?
To answer this question, the researchers compared the results of the tests and measurements that were done before and after the participants got the study drug.
Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants' results during the study. But, these changes were too small for the researchers to consider them to be meaningful.
The doctors also kept track of the "adverse events" that the participants had during the study. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all of the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study drug. An adverse event is considered "serious" when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the drug in the study.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the adverse events that happened during this study.
Serious adverse events
There were 2.8% of participants who had serious adverse events during the study.
This was 1 out of 36 participants. This participant got 100 mg of benralizumab, and had the serious adverse event of a bone fracture in the neck. The researchers did not consider this serious adverse event to be related to the study drug.
None of the participants died during the study.
