- Headache: 3.9% (2) in the benralizumab group, 7.7% (4) in the placebo group, and 5.8% (6) in total.
- Common cold: 3.9% (2) in the benralizumab group, 7.7% (4) in the placebo group, and 5.8% (6) in total.
- Pain in the mouth or throat: 5.9% (3) in the benralizumab group, 3.8% (2) in the placebo group, and 4.9% (5) in total.
- Viral stomach bug: 5.9% (3) in the benralizumab group, 1.9% (1) in the placebo group, and 3.9% (4) in total.
- Infection of the nose, throat, and airways: 5.9% (3) in the benralizumab group, 1.9% (1) in the placebo group, and 3.9% (4) in total.
