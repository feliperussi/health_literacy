Overall, researchers found the following:

- Generally, AZD7594 was taken up into the blood and then slowly removed from the body.
- After 8 days of treatment, AZD7594 reached steady levels in the blood.
- How AZD7594 acted in the body was dependent on the dose. The higher the dose, the higher the average and highest amount of AZD7594 in the blood, and the longer it took for AZD7594 to leave the body.
- There was very little AZD7594 removed from the body through the urine.

How was the body affected by AZD7594?

Researchers also wanted to know how the body was affected by AZD7594. Researchers measured the levels of 2 hormones called cortisol and DHEAS, as well as a protein called osteocalcin, in participants' blood. These hormones and protein are related to the glucocorticoid system in the body. Researchers found:

- There was no difference in cortisol levels between the placebo and AZD7594 groups on Day 1. On Day 16, participants in the 1600 µg AZD7594 group had the highest difference in cortisol levels compared to the placebo group.
- Average DHEAS levels were similar between Day 1 and Day 16 in the placebo group. In the 200 µg AZD7594 and 400 µg AZD7594 groups, average DHEAS levels were slightly lower on Day 16 than on Day 1. In the 1600 µg AZD7594 group, average DHEAS levels were slightly higher on Day 16 than on Day 1.
- There was no difference in osteocalcin levels between the placebo and AZD7594 groups throughout the study.

What medical problems did participants have?

A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study. These medical problems are called "adverse events". These medical problems may or may not be caused by the study drug.

How many participants had medical problems in the study?

No participants stopped taking the study drugs because of a medical problem.
