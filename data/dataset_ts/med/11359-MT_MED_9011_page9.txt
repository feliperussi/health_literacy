Did acalabrutinib help the participants stay alive and breathe without help?
No. Overall, the researchers found that acalabrutinib did not help the participants stay alive and breathe without help.

To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of participants who were alive and could breathe without help 2 weeks after the study started. They did this for each treatment group. The researchers calculated these numbers as a percentage. Then, they compared the results in the group who took acalabrutinib and BSC to the results in the group who took BSC only.

The researchers found that after 2 weeks of treatment, the percentage of participants who stayed alive and could breathe without help was similar between the 2 groups.

The percentage of participants who were alive and could breathe without help after 2 weeks of treatment was:
- 83.1% of those who were planned to take acalabrutinib and BSC. This was 74 out of 89 participants.
- 90.9% of those who were planned to take BSC only. This was 80 out of 88 participants.
