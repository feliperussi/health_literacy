The participants in this study took acalabrutinib.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X How many participants responded to treatment with acalabrutinib?
Overall, the researchers found that after taking acalabrutinib:
- 90.3% of the participants whose leukemia had come back or stopped responding to prior treatment responded to treatment with acalabrutinib. This was 28 out of 31 participants.
- 87.5% of the participants who had not received prior treatment for leukemia responded to treatment with acalabrutinib. This was 14 out of 16 participants.
X What medical problems happened during this study?
During the study, there were 100.0% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug.
