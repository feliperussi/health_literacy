Did the particle size of acalabrutinib affect how much got into the blood?
The researchers found that overall, the particle size of acalabrutinib in the tablets did not affect how much acalabrutinib got into the blood.
To answer this question, in Part 2, the study doctors measured:
- the average total amount of acalabrutinib in the blood during the study
- the average highest amount of acalabrutinib in the blood during the study
Then, the researchers compared the results from Treatments 1, 2, and 3 when the participants took:
- acalabrutinib with a standard particle size
- acalabrutinib with a small particle size
- acalabrutinib with a large particle size
Did the participants find the smell and taste of acalabrutinib tablets mixed with water to be acceptable?
Overall, the researchers found that the smell of the acalabrutinib tablets mixed with water was acceptable to the participants, but the taste was bitter.
To answer this question, the researchers asked the participants in Part 2 to fill out surveys about the smell and taste of the acalabrutinib tablets when mixed with water. Most participants could not sense any smell. The participants found that the strongest type of taste they could sense was a bitter taste.
The researchers concluded that, in the future, they will not need to change the smell of the acalabrutinib tablets mixed with water, but they might need to change the taste.
