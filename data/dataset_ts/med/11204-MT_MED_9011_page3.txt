Clinical Study Results

The chart below shows the treatments the participants took.
- Part 1: (16 participants) 
- Part 2: (15 participants) 
- Part 3: (15 participants) 

What study treatment did the participants take? 
- All of the participants took savolitinib as a pill by mouth. 
- All of the participants took itraconazole as a pill by mouth. 
- All of the participants took savolitinib and itraconazole as a pill by mouth.

How often did the participants take study treatment? 
- Once 
- Once a day for 3 days (savolitinib and itraconazole on the first day, itraconazole only on the second day)

What happened during the study? 
The study started in November 2019 and ended in January 2020. 

Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 1 time over the course of about 1 month. During this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
- Did a physical examination
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking

While the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 2 times over the course of about 3 weeks.

During Part 1, the participants visited their study site and stayed overnight. They stayed for about half a week and took 1 dose of savolitinib.

Then, there was a “washout period” of about 2 weeks before the next visit. During this time, the participants did not take any study treatment and did not take certain medicines. This means that their bodies had time to process all of the savolitinib, and any medicines in their blood had “washed out” of their bodies.
