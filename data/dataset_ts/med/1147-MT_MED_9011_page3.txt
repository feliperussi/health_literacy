Clinical Study Results
The participants also took their normal asthma treatments at the beginning of the study. But after 6 weeks, these treatments were slowly decreased and then stopped. This was done so that the participants could safely stop taking their normal asthma treatments. During the study, the participants were also allowed to take an asthma treatment if they experienced a worsening of their asthma. This was called a "rescue treatment". A rescue treatment is a treatment chosen by study doctors for participants to help manage their asthma. Doctors use rescue treatments in studies if they think it can help participants manage their disease without affecting the study results.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the study treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
What happened during the study?
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 2 times over the course of 4 weeks. At the first of these visits, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study.
The study doctors:
- Did a physical examination
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants' heart health by using a medical scan called an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
- Checked the participants' lung health, asthma symptoms, and overall health
- Asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what asthma treatments and other medicines they were taking
During the second visit, the participants who could join the study received study equipment. They used the equipment throughout the study to record their asthma symptoms, record any swelling in the lungs that happened, and measure how well their lungs were working.
