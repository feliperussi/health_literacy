Clinical Study Results

What happened during this study?

Before this study started, the participants visited their study site twice over the course of 4 weeks to make sure they could join the study. During this time, the doctors:

- Did a physical examination of the participants
- Checked the participants' lung function by having participants blow into a mouthpiece connected to a meter that measures the amount of air they can force out of their lungs
- Checked the participants' heart health by doing a test called an electrocardiogram, or ECG
- Took blood samples from the participants
- Asked about the participants' medical history
- Asked the participants how they were feeling
- Learned what medicines the participants were taking
- Asked the participants to stop taking most of their own medicines to treat COPD

During this study, the participants were asked to visit their study site 7 more times over the next 24 weeks. During this time, the participants took 1 of the following treatments twice a day:

- 664 participants took 320 micrograms, or µg for short, of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together, using MDI
- 649 participants took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together, using MDI
- 648 participants took 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate only, using MDI
- 209 participants took 320 µg of budesonide only, using MDI
- 219 participants took 400 µg of budesonide and 12 µg of formoterol fumarate together, using TBH

The participants could also use rescue medicines for COPD provided by the study doctor if they needed it.

At the end of this study, the doctors called the participants and asked how they were feeling and learned what medicines the participants were taking since their last dose of study treatment.
