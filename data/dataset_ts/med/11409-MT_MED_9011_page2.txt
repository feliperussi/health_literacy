Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have asthma. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if GP MDI works in a large number of people with asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow. This makes it difficult to breathe. People with asthma can have wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. There are treatments that can help control asthma symptoms, but some people may still have uncontrolled asthma. This means that existing treatments do not fully control their asthma.
Asthma treatments are usually taken through an inhaler. GP MDI is taken through a "metered dose" inhaler that delivers a specific amount of the study drug to the lungs. GP MDI is a "long-acting" study drug that works by relaxing muscles in the breathing tubes to allow more air into the lungs. This makes it easier to breathe.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how different doses of GP MDI affected the participants' asthma.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did GP MDI affect the amount of air the participants could breathe out?
- Did the participants' quality of life change after taking GP MDI?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with asthma that had not been controlled by inhaler treatments. The participants in this study were 12 to 80 years old when they joined. The participants were not taking steroid tablets for their asthma, and were not current smokers.
