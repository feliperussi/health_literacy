Clinical Study Results:
Can AZD1419 help decrease asthma symptoms?
No. Overall, the researchers found that AZD1419 treatment did not help decrease the participants' asthma symptoms compared to the placebo treatment.
To answer this question, the researchers kept track of the following throughout the study:
- how often the participants had asthma symptoms
- the severity of asthma symptoms
- the participants' survey scores about how they were feeling
The researchers compared these results throughout the study between the 2 treatment groups.
Overall, there was a small difference in asthma symptoms that all participants experienced during the study. This meant that the AZD1419 treatment did not help decrease asthma symptoms compared to the placebo treatment.
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions during the study.
None of the participants died because of serious adverse reactions during the study.
