Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in this study were 18 to 56 years old when they joined. None of the participants smoked or used any products containing nicotine for 3 months before joining the study. The study included 66 participants in the United States.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat B-cell lymphoid cancer, also known as B-cell lymphoma. Before a drug or a form of a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.

B-cell lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects B lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of blood cancers. It works by stopping the cancer cells from growing out of control.

Acalabrutinib in a capsule form was already studied and approved in healthy participants and participants with liver problems. Researchers are now studying acalabrutinib in a tablet form to see if it works in a similar way to the approved capsule form.

In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how much acalabrutinib got into the participants' blood when it was taken as a tablet, compared with when it was taken as a capsule.
