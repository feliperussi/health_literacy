What were the study results?

Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients.

Further clinical studies with the 3 strain vaccine are planned in 2017.

Were the fever rates comparable between the participants who got the 3 strain vaccine and those who got the placebo?

Yes. Rates of fever were comparable between the 3 strain vaccine group and the placebo group. One out of 240 participants (0.4%) who got the 3 strain vaccine reported a fever. No participants who got placebo reported a fever.

Overall, because the rates of fever were so low, the researchers concluded the 3 strain vaccine was unlikely to be an important cause of fever.
