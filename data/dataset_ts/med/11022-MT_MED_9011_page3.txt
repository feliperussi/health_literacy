Who took part in the study?

The researchers asked for the help of males and females with severe asthma. The participants in this study were 12 to 78 years old when they joined. The participants all had severe asthma.

The study included 216 participants in Canada, Japan, Poland, and the United States.

Why was the research needed?

Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about 2 different devices to inject tezepelumab at the study site and at home in a large number of participants with severe asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have asthma may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath.

There are treatments that can help people who have asthma manage their symptoms. But, these treatments may not help some people control their symptoms and may cause medical problems.

The study drug, tezepelumab, is being developed as a treatment for asthma. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how well the participants or their caregivers or study doctors could inject tezepelumab using 2 different devices.
