Clinical Trial RESULTS

What were the study results?

How did AZD7594 act in the body?

Researchers took blood samples both on Day 1 after the first dose of the study drug and on Day 16 after the last dose of the study drug. Participants took the study drug once on Day 1 and then did not take the study drug on Days 2, 3, or 4. Starting on Day 5, participants took the study drug once a day until Day 16, which was a 12-day period. Researchers wanted to see how the study drug acted in the body, including the following:

- The highest amount of AZD7594 in the blood

- How long it took for AZD7594 to reach its highest amount in the blood

- The overall daily amount of AZD7594 in the blood

Highest amount of AZD7594 in the blood

Researchers measured the highest amount of AZD7594 in participants' blood in picomoles per liter of blood (pmol/L). This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement. The table below shows this amount for both Day 1 and Day 16 in the study.

- Study day 1: 1206 pmol/L

- Study day 16: 900 pmol/L
