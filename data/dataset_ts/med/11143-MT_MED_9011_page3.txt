What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of capivasertib when given with some of the existing medicines for prostate cancer. The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
- What medical problems happened during this study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if capivasertib helps improve the health of men who have prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took capivasertib and another drug called abiraterone. The participants were already getting treatment for their prostate cancer called "androgen deprivation therapy", also called ADT. Abiraterone is an approved treatment for prostate cancer. All of the participants also took a steroid tablet to reduce the chance of having medical problems caused by abiraterone.

Before the study started, the researchers had planned that some participants would take capivasertib with another approved prostate cancer drug called enzalutamide. This part of the study did not happen because there was a change in the drug development plans.

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.

Study treatment doses were measured in milligrams, also called "mg".
