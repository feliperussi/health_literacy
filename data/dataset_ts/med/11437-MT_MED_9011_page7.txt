How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how acalabrutinib acts in the blood in healthy participants when taken with flat Coca-Cola and the proton-pump inhibitor rabeprazole. This can be helpful to understand how acalabrutinib may act in patients with COVID-19.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with acalabrutinib for the treatment of COVID-19 are not planned.
