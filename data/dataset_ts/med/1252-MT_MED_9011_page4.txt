Anifrolumab is a drug that works by stopping the type 1 IFN from sending signals through the body. Researchers think that this could decrease inflammation and disease symptoms in people with lupus and lupus nephritis.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if anifrolumab works in participants with active proliferative lupus nephritis.

What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did anifrolumab plus standard of care decrease inflammation in the kidneys compared to a placebo plus standard of care?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if anifrolumab helps improve the health of people with active proliferative lupus nephritis.

What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, all of the participants got either a low or high dose of anifrolumab plus standard of care or a placebo plus standard of care.

A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused by the drug.

"Standard of care" means the treatment that the medical community thinks is appropriate and widely accepted for a condition.

This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was getting. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
