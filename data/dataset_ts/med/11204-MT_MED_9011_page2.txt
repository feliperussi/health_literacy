Clinical Study Results

Itraconazole is a drug prescribed by doctors to treat fungal and yeast infections. It has also been shown to slow down the removal of certain substances from the body. So, the researchers wanted to learn if itraconazole slows down the removal of savolitinib from the body. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

What was the purpose of this study?

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How did savolitinib act in the body when taken with itraconazole?
- What medical problems happened during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know. Other studies are being done to find out if savolitinib helps improve the health of people who have tumors.

What treatments did the participants take?

This study had 3 parts. The participants took savolitinib during Part 1, itraconazole during Part 2, and both treatments during Part 3. The participants took each treatment as a pill by mouth.

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.

It was planned that the same participants would be in all 3 parts. But, there was 1 participant who left the study before it ended.
