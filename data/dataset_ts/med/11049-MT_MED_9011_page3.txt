What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of AZD4635 in Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors.
The main questions that the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD4635 helps improve the health of people who have advanced solid tumors.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took AZD4635 as capsules by mouth.
This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
The researchers wanted to learn about the safety of 2 different doses of AZD4635.
The doses of AZD4635 were measured in milligrams, also known as "mg". The participants took either 50 mg or 75 mg of AZD4635 once a day until their cancer got worse or until they decided to stop taking the treatment.
