Clinical Trial Results

What has happened since my study ended?

Your study started in November 2015 and ended in May 2016. It included
30 participants at 1 study site in the United States. When the study ended, the
sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results. This is a summary
of that report.

Why was the research needed?

Before a new drug can be approved, research must be done to show that it is
safe and effective. One of the first steps in studying a new drug is to test it in
healthy people, or in people without any serious health problems.

Researchers were looking for a better way to treat lupus. Those with lupus
may have higher levels of certain proteins that cause their immune system to
attack healthy cells in the body. One of these proteins is called Type I interferon.
The trial drug anifrolumab is a type of antibody that can block this protein.
Antibodies are normally made by the body's immune system to fight off
infection. Researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat
a variety of conditions, including lupus.

In the study, the researchers compared anifrolumab to a placebo. A placebo
looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine in it. Participants got
anifrolumab or the placebo in 1 of 3 ways.

They got their treatment through: 
- an injection under the skin 
- a needle in their vein, called an IV needle 
- an infusion pump. An infusion pump has a needle like an IV needle, but it is attached to a machine that controls how much medicine a person will get through the needle.

Researchers wanted to know: 
- How did anifrolumab act in the body? 
- What medical problems did participants have after getting anifrolumab?

Your study included healthy men and women who were 19 to 55 years old.
