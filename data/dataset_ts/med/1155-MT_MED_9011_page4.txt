Single-dose treatment

What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers and doctors look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with the 1-strain vaccine are not currently planned.

Did more participants who got the 1-strain vaccine have a fever in the first 7 days after getting the vaccine compared to participants who got the placebo?
No. Researchers counted how many participants reported having a fever. Researchers used degrees Fahrenheit, or °F, to measure participants’ temperatures.

Researchers counted the number of participants who reported having a fever of 101°F or higher in the first 7 days after getting the 1-strain vaccine or the placebo. They found the following:
- 1-strain vaccine: 1 of 241 participants (0.4%) who got the 1-strain vaccine reported a fever of at least 101°F or higher in the first 7 days of getting treatment.
- Placebo: 1 of 59 participants (1.7%) who got the placebo reported a fever of at least 101°F or higher in the first 7 days of getting treatment.
