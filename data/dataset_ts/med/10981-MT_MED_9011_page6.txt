There was 1 participant who left the study in the first 7 days before any participant got verinurad or the placebo. So, the results below are for 21 participants from both Group 1 and Group 2.

Did the participants' safety results change during the study?

To answer this question, the doctors did tests and measurements before and after the participants took study treatment. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of these tests and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these to be significant.

The doctors also kept track of the "adverse events" that the participants had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during the study. Adverse events are considered "serious" when they are life-threatening, cause lasting problems, or require hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the study treatments.
