What medical problems happened during the study?
The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study doctors think might be related to the study drug are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
