How much AZD9977 got into the participants' blood?
The researchers wanted to know how much AZD9977 got into the blood when the participants took it alone compared to when they took it with itraconazole.
To answer this question, the study doctors measured the amount of AZD9977 in the participants' blood in Part 1 and in Part 2. They measured:
- the average highest amount of AZD9977
- the average total amount of AZD9977 over time
- the average total amount of AZD9977, up to the last blood sample taken during the study

Average highest amount of AZD9977
The average highest amount of AZD9977 was measured in units called nanomoles per liter, also known as nmol/L. The researchers found that the average highest amount of AZD9977 in the blood was:
- 2,244 nmol/L when AZD9977 was taken alone
- 4,992 nmol/L when AZD9977 was taken with itraconazole
