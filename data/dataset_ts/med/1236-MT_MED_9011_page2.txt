Clinical Study Results

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about how an auto-injection device containing benralizumab works in a large number of participants with asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

Asthma is a disease that can cause swelling in the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe. Benralizumab is a drug that is already approved to treat asthma and can help reduce this swelling. The drug is given through a needle under the skin, also known as an injection.

The drug injection device in this study has not yet been approved for patients to use at the doctor's office or to take at home.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were: 
- How did the auto-injection device work?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

To answer the questions in this study, researchers asked for the help of men and women with asthma. The participants in this study were 18 to 75 years old when they joined.

What kind of study was this?
This was an "open-label" study. This means the researchers and the participants knew what the participants were taking.

All of the participants in the study took benralizumab through the auto-injection device.
