Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with COVID-19 who needed hospital care. The participants in this study were 23 to 80 years old when they joined.
The study included 62 participants in the United States.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COVID-19 in people whose infection is severe enough that they need hospital care. Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of acalabrutinib in a small number of participants with COVID-19 who needed hospital care. They also wanted to find out how acalabrutinib worked for these participants.
COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can cause swelling in the airways and lungs. This can lead to lung damage, difficulty breathing, and other medical problems. If the swelling is severe, people who have COVID-19 may need a breathing tube and a ventilator to help them breathe.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of cancer. But in animal studies, researchers have found that acalabrutinib may also reduce swelling in the lungs. Based on the results from these animal studies, researchers thought that acalabrutinib might be able to decrease swelling in the lungs and airways in patients who have COVID-19.
