After 16 weeks, could the participants who took dapagliflozin walk farther in 6 minutes?
No. Overall, the participants who took dapagliflozin could not walk farther after taking study treatment.
The numbers of participants whose results were included in this part of the study were:
- 150 participants who took dapagliflozin
- 148 participants who took a placebo
Overall, the researchers found that the participants could walk a median of:
- 20.0 m farther than at the start of the study, for the participants who took dapagliflozin
- 13.5 m farther than at the start of the study, for the participants who took the placebo
The researchers then did extra statistical tests on these results that showed that dapagliflozin did not help the participants walk farther.
