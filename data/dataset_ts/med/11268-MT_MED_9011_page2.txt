Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in this study were 20 to 45 years old when they joined.
The study included 25 participants, all in Germany.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. People with asthma may have symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. There are treatments that can help control asthma symptoms, but these may not fully control asthma for some people.
COPD is a long-lasting inflammation of the lungs that blocks the airways and makes it difficult to breathe. It also causes shortness of breath.
Asthma and COPD treatments can be taken as dry powder through an inhaler. They can also be taken using a nebulizer. A nebulizer machine turns a liquid form of the treatment into a mist. This mist is slowly breathed in using a mask or mouthpiece.
The study drug, abediterol, is an inhaled treatment. Abediterol works by relaxing the airways in the breathing tubes to allow more air into the lungs. Researchers think this will make it easier for people with asthma or COPD to breathe.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about how much abediterol got into the participants' blood when it was taken through 2 different nebulizers or a dry powder inhaler.
