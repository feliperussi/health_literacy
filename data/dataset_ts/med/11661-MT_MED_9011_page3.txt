What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to see if a combined dapagliflozin and metformin
tablet worked in the same way as separate tablets in healthy Chinese adults.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Does a combined dapagliflozin and metformin tablet work in the same way
as separate dapagliflozin and metformin tablets?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know to help understand if
a combined dapagliflozin and metformin tablet can help people with type 2
diabetes control their blood glucose levels.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all the participants took dapagliflozin and metformin. The doses of
study treatments were measured in milligrams, also known as "mg".
This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study
doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking during
each treatment part.
In this study, there were:
- 4 different combinations of study treatments: A, B, C, and D
- 2 treatment groups: Group 1 and Group 2
- 2 treatment parts: Part 1 and then Part 2
