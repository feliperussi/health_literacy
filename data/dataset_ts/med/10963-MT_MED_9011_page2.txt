Clinical Study Results
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
• Did the participants' safety results change during the study?
• What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that help find out if AZD9977 improves the health of people who have heart failure.

The researchers asked for the help of healthy Japanese men. The participants in this study were 22 to 49 years old when they joined.

What kind of study was this?
This was a "single-blind" study. This means the researchers knew what the participants were taking, but the participants did not. This was also a "dose-escalation" study. This means that the participants who took AZD9977 took only 1 dose amount of the drug during the study. Researchers use dose escalation treatments so they can study the effects and safety of a drug dose before increasing the dose for other participants.

In this study, the participants took either AZD9977 or a placebo as a liquid by mouth. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug. The AZD9977 doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg.

A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.

What happened during the study?
Before treatment, the participants visited their study site 1 time over the course of about 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
• did a physical examination and checked the participants' vital signs
• took blood and urine samples
• checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
• asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.
