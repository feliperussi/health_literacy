What was the purpose of this study? The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:

- Was the amount of ceralasertib that got into the participants' blood different when taken by itself compared to with acalabrutinib?
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if ceralasertib and acalabrutinib help improve the health of people with CLL.
