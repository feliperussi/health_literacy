What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took a combination of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate. The participants took 3 BGF MDIs, which each had a different propellant. Each participant took all 3 BGF MDIs in a different order. The propellants that were in each BGF MDI were: X propellant HFO, X propellant HFC, X propellant HFA. This was a "single-blind" study. This means the researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what the participants were taking, but the participants did not.

There were 6 groups of participants. Each group took all of the study treatments, and each group took them in a different order. There were groups for all possible orders of taking the combined inhaled treatments. There were 7 or 8 participants in each of the groups. A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which each participant took the study treatments. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.

The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study. 47 male participants in total BGF MDIs containing 3 different propellants:

- First BGF MDI 1 time, then
- Second BGF MDI 1 time, 3 to 7 days later, then
- Third BGF MDI 1 time, 3 to 7 days later
