What happened during this study?
The study started in April 2021 and ended in June 2021.
Before the participants took their study treatment, they visited the study site to make sure they could join the study. The study doctor:
- Did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems they were having
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
This part of the study lasted up to 21 days to allow the doctors to receive and check any test results.
The participants stayed at the study site for the whole study. There were 2 main Parts to the study. There was a gap of more than 4 days between Part 1 and Part 2. This was for the study treatments to wash out of the participants’ bodies.
