Clinical Trial Results
During Part 2, you were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments:
- 50 mg of AZD2014 in tablets twice a day, continuously
- 125 mg of AZD2014 in tablets twice a day for 2 days in a row, followed by a 5 day rest, plus fulvestrant on Day 1 and Day 15 of the first treatment cycle and then monthly as an injection in the muscle
In Part 2, researchers measured how effective AZD2014 was and if AZD2014 was safe to use.
You visited the clinic 4 times each month during Part 2.
Throughout the study, your study doctor examined you regularly. They did a physical examination, which included checking your height, weight, and heart health. They also measured your tumor and asked how you were feeling and what medicines you were taking.
Open-label study: 4 participants
The 4 participants got 1 type of treatment
The 4 participants got:
- Treatment 1: AZD2014 (50 mg twice daily)
- Treatment 2: AZD2014 (125 mg twice daily for 2 days in a row followed by a 5-day rest), plus fulvestrant as a monthly injection in the muscle
Dose given on Day 1; AZD2014 was taken daily; fulvestrant was given an 8-day clinic stay on Day 1 of every cycle and on Day 15 of Cycle 1
At the end of the study, study doctors did another physical examination, measured your tumor, and asked how you were feeling and what medicines you were taking.
What were the study results?
Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients. Further clinical studies with AZD2014 are ongoing.
