Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking to find out if there is a better way to give a treatment for asthma, by giving it at home. The treatment is called tezepelumab. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study got tezepelumab through a needle under the skin, also called an injection. They got tezepelumab through 1 of 2 different injection devices. These were called the accessorized pre-filled syringe, and an autoinjector.

What were the results of the study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:

- How many participants had successful tezepelumab injections?
The researchers found that:
• 91.7% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the accessorized pre-filled syringe had successful injections. This was 100 out of 109 participants.
• 92.4% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the autoinjector had successful injections. This was 97 out of 105 participants.

- Did the participants feel that tezepelumab helped them control their asthma?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that the participants felt that their asthma was more controlled after getting tezepelumab compared to before they started the study.

- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
There were 2.8% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. The most common medical problem was pain at the site of an injection. More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
