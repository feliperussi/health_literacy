What were the results of this study? This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the study results.

Because the participants who got the placebo did not have any tezepelumab in their blood, their results are not included in this part of the summary.

How did each of the 3 different doses of tezepelumab pass through, break down and leave the participants' bodies? To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants before their injection, and at several times after their injection.

The researchers then measured how the amount of tezepelumab changed in the participants' blood over time. From these results, the researchers calculated:
- The average highest concentration of tezepelumab in the participants' blood
- The average total amount of tezepelumab in the participants' blood
- The average total amount of tezepelumab in the participants' blood between the first and last blood samples taken during the study

The researchers found that these measurements were different between the groups. All of these measurements were lowest in the participants who got the low dose of tezepelumab and highest in the participants who got the high dose of tezepelumab.
