Clinical Study Results
What treatments did the participants get?

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.

In this study, all of the participants got tezepelumab through a needle under the skin. This is also known as an injection. The participants got the same amount of tezepelumab through 1 of 3 different injections.

The first group of participants got an injection through a vial and syringe filled by the doctors.

The second group of participants got an injection through a pre-filled syringe. This syringe had a plunger at its top and a protective layer around the needle. This type of syringe is known as an accessorized syringe. Doctors use accessorized syringes to increase the safety of a syringe and reduce the chance of injury.

The third group of participants got an injection through a device, called an auto-injector. Auto-injectors are devices that deliver injections by a button push or by pressing the device against the injection site.

All of the injections were given in liquid form. The amount of liquid was measured in milliliters, also called mL. The amount of tezepelumab within the liquid was measured in milligrams, also called mg. All of the participants got the same amount of liquid and the same amount of tezepelumab within the liquid.
