Clinical Study Results

Before treatment, the participants used a paper diary. They recorded when they took the study treatments, Atrovent HFA, and Ventolin HFA. They also recorded their COPD symptoms in the paper diary so the researchers could follow what happened to the participants during the study.

After treatment, the participants started taking their usual COPD medications again. The study staff called the participants 7 to 10 days after the last visit to ask them questions about their smoking, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.

Before treatment:
- Doctors checked the health of participants.
- Participants took 1 of the study treatments below in the first treatment period and the other in the second treatment period.
- Participants took Atrovent HFA for 7-21 days.
- 14.4 µg of GP MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks.
- 9.6 µg of FF MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks.
- Participants took Atrovent HFA for 5-21 days between treatment periods.
- Participants had lung scans and breathing tests.

During treatment:
- Doctors checked the health of participants.
- Participants took Atrovent HFA for 7-21 days.
- 14.4 µg of GP MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks.
- 9.6 µg of FF MDI 2 times a day for 2 weeks.
- Participants took Atrovent HFA for 5-21 days between treatment periods.
- Participants had lung scans and breathing tests.

After treatment:
- Study staff called the participants 7-10 days after the last visit.
- Participants answered questions about their health.
- Doctors checked the health of participants.
