Clinical Trial RESULTS

What kind of study was this?
This study was a "double-blind" study. This means that none of the participants, study doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant received. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting can affect the results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly.

Participants got either the 3 strain vaccine or the placebo in a single-dose treatment. The participants were separated into different groups by chance, similar to rolling dice.

What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to 7 months.
First, to see if you could join the study, researchers did a physical exam, including checking your height, weight, and temperature. They asked about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking. If you were female, you had a blood or urine test to make sure you were not pregnant.

Once you joined the study, you were randomly assigned to receive either the 3 strain vaccine or placebo. The vaccine or placebo was sprayed into your nose. For every 5 participants, 4 received the 3 strain vaccine and 1 received the placebo. Out of 300 participants, 240 received the 3 strain vaccine and 60 received the placebo.

Study doctors checked how you were feeling for 180 days, or 6 months, after receiving the vaccine or placebo. They called you to learn what other medicines you were taking and if you had any new medical problems.
