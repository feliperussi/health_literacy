What treatments did the participants receive?
    
In this summary, "trial treatment" means anything the participants received as a part of the trial. This includes roxadustat and rHuEPO. Roxadustat is the treatment that the researchers wanted to learn more about.
    
The participants in this trial received roxadustat or rHuEPO. This was an "open-label" trial. This means the participants, researchers, trial doctors, and other trial staff knew what each participant was receiving.
    
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant received. This was based on whether the participants needed dialysis or not, and if they had received rHuEPO before or not. Dialysis is a treatment for CKD that uses a machine to replace the function of the kidneys and filter the blood.
    
Using a computer program to choose the treatment each participant received helped make sure the groups were chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
