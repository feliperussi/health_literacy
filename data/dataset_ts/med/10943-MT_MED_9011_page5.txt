What was the purpose of this study?

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did AZD4831 reduce the activity of MPO in the blood?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD4831 helps improve the health of people with HFpEF.

What treatments did the participants take?

In this study, the participants took AZD4831 or a placebo. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take treatment are actually caused by the treatment.

This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the study.

A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.

The participants took AZD4831 or the placebo as a tablet by mouth, once a day for about 3 months.

When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
