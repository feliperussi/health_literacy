Clinical Study Results

The figure below shows how this study was done.

Double-blind study:
2,389 participants

Screening:
- 2 visits

Treatment:
- 7 visits
- Doctors checked the health of participants.
- Participants took budesonide only, formoterol fumarate only, or both medicines together twice a day using MDI or TBH.
- Participants completed surveys about how they were feeling and had their lung function tested.

Follow-up:
- Phone call

- Doctors called the participants and asked how they were feeling.
- Participants had their lung function tested about 2 weeks after the last treatment visit.

What were the results of the study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

How did the treatments affect lung function of the participants?

In general, treatments of budesonide and formoterol fumarate together using MDI improved lung function of the participants more than the treatments with either budesonide or formoterol fumarate alone using MDI.

To answer this question, the researchers measured participantsâ€™ lung function before and after they took the inhaler treatments.

These amounts of air were measured in milliliters, or mL.
