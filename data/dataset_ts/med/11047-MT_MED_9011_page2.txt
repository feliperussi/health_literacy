Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of adolescents with asthma. The participants in this study were 12 to 17 years old when they joined. The study included 36 participants in the United States. The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works. Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. This can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. There are treatments that can help people manage their asthma symptoms. But, these treatments may not help some people. They may also cause medical problems.

The study drug, AZD7594, was developed as an inhaled asthma treatment. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how AZD7594 acted in the participantsâ€™ blood. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study. This information may help researchers to set doses in adolescents and help future researchers determine which doses of AZD7594 to give to future study participants.
