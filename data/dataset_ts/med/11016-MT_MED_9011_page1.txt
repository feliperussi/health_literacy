Protocol Number: D169EC00001

Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study treatment dapagliflozin. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about dapagliflozin to help people who have a type of heart failure called HFpEF. HFpEF stands for 'heart failure with preserved ejection fraction'. HFpEF happens when the heart can pump normally or nearly normally but becomes too stiff to fill properly. This means that the blood collects in the lungs and in the rest of the body.

AstraZeneca sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results of the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.

If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the study doctor or staff at your study site.
