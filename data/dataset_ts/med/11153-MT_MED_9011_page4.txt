Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat NAFLD and NASH in people with obesity. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is. 

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if cotadutide works in a small number of participants with obesity and NAFLD or NASH. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study. 

Some people with obesity can have inflammation and a build-up of fat in their liver. This is often linked to drinking alcohol. When it is not linked to drinking alcohol, it is called NAFLD. The build-up of liver fat can increase the risk of health problems such as liver disease and other diseases including heart attack and stroke. NASH is a type of NAFLD. Patients with NASH can have inflammation of the liver and liver damage, in addition to fat in their liver. Obesity can cause NAFLD and NASH. NAFLD and NASH can be more dangerous for people with obesity who already have an increased risk of liver disease and heart disease. 

The study drug, cotadutide, was designed to lower blood sugar levels by helping the body to produce more insulin. It also slows digestion and reduces appetite, which may lead to some weight loss. It is an established treatment for diabetes that improves control of blood sugar and fat levels in the body. Researchers think that cotadutide may help patients with obesity and NAFLD or NASH. 

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of cotadutide in participants with obesity and NAFLD or NASH.
