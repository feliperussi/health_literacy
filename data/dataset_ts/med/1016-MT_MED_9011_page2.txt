Clinical Study Results
Why was the research needed? Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have heart failure. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin works in a large number of participants with heart failure. These participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, also called HFrEF. The researchers also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study. Heart failure is a condition where the heart muscle becomes too weak to properly pump blood through the whole body. Heart failure is a long-lasting condition that can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, and swelling of certain tissues. In serious cases of heart failure, there is an increased risk of other heart problems, and of death. The study drug, dapagliflozin, is used for people with type 2 diabetes. It helps the body remove sugar from the blood and leave the body in the urine. Researchers think dapagliflozin could help reduce the risk of heart failure. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out more about if dapagliflozin affects participants who have heart failure. The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did the participants who took dapagliflozin have fewer heart failure related hospital visits and fewer deaths from heart problems?
- Did the participants feel their heart failure symptoms were better after taking dapagliflozin?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study? To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with heart failure who may or may not have type 2 diabetes. The participants were between the ages of 22 and 94.
