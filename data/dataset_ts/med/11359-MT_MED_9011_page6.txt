What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either:
- X acalabrutinib and "best supportive care", also called BSC
- X BSC only
BSC was decided for each participant by their study doctor and the guidelines at the hospital. The participants who took acalabrutinib took it as a capsule by mouth. The doses of acalabrutinib were measured in milligrams, also known as mg.
This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The participants took study treatment while they were already in the hospital because of COVID-19.
