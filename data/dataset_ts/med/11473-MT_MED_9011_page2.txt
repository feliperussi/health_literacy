Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in this study were 21 to 50 years old when they joined. The study included 25 participants in Germany.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat both chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Before drugs can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe they are and how they work.

Chronic kidney disease and heart failure are serious long-term health conditions. Having high levels of uric acid in the blood can worsen some of the symptoms of chronic kidney disease and heart failure. It can also increase the risk of developing these conditions. The study drugs, verinurad and allopurinol, were designed to reduce the amount of uric acid in the blood.

In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how verinurad and allopurinol work when taken together in different ways in healthy participants.
