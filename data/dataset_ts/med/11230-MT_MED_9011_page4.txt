What happened during this study?
The study started in September 2019 and ended in March 2020. The participants were in the study for about 10 weeks.
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants' health to make sure they could join the study. The study doctors:
- did a physical exam and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 3 times. This part of the study lasted nearly 3 weeks.
- At each of the 3 visits, the participants stayed overnight at the study site for 4 days.
- The participants got an injection of cotadutide on the second day of each study site stay.
- The participants got each injection in the morning after not eating or drinking for 8 hours overnight. After each injection, the participants waited 6 hours before eating.
- The researchers measured how much cotadutide was in the participants' blood. They did this on the day of each injection and for the next 2 days after each injection.
After the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted about 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
