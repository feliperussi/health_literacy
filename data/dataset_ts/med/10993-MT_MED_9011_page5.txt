What were the results of this study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

The researchers were not able to use the results of 1 participant who had moderate COPD. This was because the participant did not use their inhaler correctly. So, the below results are for 17 of the 18 participants.

How much of the combined inhaled study drugs reached the lungs?

To answer this question, the study doctors "radiolabeled" the study drugs before the participants inhaled them. This means that the study doctors added a safe amount of a radioactive substance to the study drugs. Right after the participants inhaled the study drugs, they held their breath for no more than 10 seconds, and then released it. Then, the study doctors scanned the participants' lungs. In these scans, the radiolabeled substance helped them "see" the study drugs in the lungs and other parts of the body.

The study doctors calculated the average percentage of the study drugs that reached the lungs in the overall group of participants. They also compared these amounts in the participants with moderate COPD to those with severe or very severe COPD.

The researchers found that the percentage of the study drugs that reached the lungs was similar in both treatment groups.
