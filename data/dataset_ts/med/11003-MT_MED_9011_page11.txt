How has this study helped participants and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn how different treatments of budesonide and formoterol fumarate affect the lung function of patients with COPD.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this 1 study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies in COPD with treatments of budesonide and formoterol fumarate together are not planned.
