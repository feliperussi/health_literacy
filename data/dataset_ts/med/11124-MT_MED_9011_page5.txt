Clinical Study Results

What were the results of the study?

Because the researchers were not able to include as many participants as they planned, they ended the study early. So, the researchers were not able to get the information they needed to answer their questions about GFF in this study.

What medical problems did participants have during the study?

The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.

The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think might be related to the study treatments are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.

During this study, there were no adverse reactions.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?

Because this study ended early, there was not enough information to help the researchers find out if GFF affected how the participants’ blood flowed through the heart.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.

Further clinical studies with GFF are not currently planned.
