Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
The study started in November 2018 and ended in June 2019.
During the study, the participants got MEDI9447 in 4-week periods called "cycles".
The participants could take part in as many cycles as they wanted unless:
- the study doctors thought that the treatment was not working
- the participants' cancer got worse
- the participants had medical problems that caused them to stop taking study treatment
If their cancer got worse, the participants stopped the treatment cycles. If the study treatment was helping the participants' cancer at the end of the study, the participants could choose to continue treatment.
