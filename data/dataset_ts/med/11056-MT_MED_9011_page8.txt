Clinical Study Results

What medical problems happened during the study?

This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for the treatments.

Some of the participants either left the study before it ended or did not follow the study guidelines. So, the researchers were not able to study the medical problems for all 315 participants.
