Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with obesity and NAFLD or NASH. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
What treatments did the participants take?
The participants in this study took cotadutide or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have?
The most common symptom that the participants reported during this study was nausea.
- What medical problems happened during this study?
Overall, there were 55.4% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug during the study. This was 41 out of 74 participants. The most common medical problem was nausea.
More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
