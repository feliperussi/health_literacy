Clinical Trial Results

What medical problems did participants have during the study?

A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem. So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study. These medical problems are called "adverse events". They may or may not be caused by the study drug.
