How much AZD4831 left the participants' bodies in their urine and faeces?
Overall, the researchers found that 83.6% of the dose of AZD4831 had left the participants' bodies in their urine and faeces after 14 days.
To answer this question, the researchers took urine and faeces samples from the participants before and after they took AZD4831. The researchers collected these samples for up to 14 days after the participants took AZD4831.
The researchers measured the total amount of radioactivity in the participants' urine and faeces. They calculated how much AZD4831 the participants had in their bodies after they first took AZD4831. Then, they compared that amount to how much AZD4831 was in their bodies after 14 days. They calculated this difference as a percentage.
