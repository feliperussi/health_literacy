What is happening with the study now?
Each participant was in the study for up to 12 weeks. But, the entire study lasted about 1.5 years. This is because the participants joined the study at different times. The study started in December 2016 and ended in June 2018. The researchers planned to include 40 participants in the study. The study was stopped early because not enough people took part. The study only included 4 participants.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
