Clinical Trial RESULTS

What kind of study was this?
Your study was a "double-blind" study. This means that none of the participants, researchers, or staff knew what treatment each participant received. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting can affect the results of the study. This way, the results are looked at fairly.

In this study, all participants got either anifrolumab or a placebo. Participants were separated into different groups by chance, like rolling dice.

What happened during the study?
You and other participants were in the study for up to 16 weeks. First, to see if you could join the study, researchers did a physical exam, including checking your height, weight, and temperature. They asked about your medical history, how you were feeling, and what medicines you were taking. If you are female, you had a blood or urine test to make sure you were not pregnant.

Once you joined the study, you were randomly assigned to get one of the 4 treatments listed below.

During the study, 30 participants were randomly assigned, like rolling dice, to take anifrolumab or a placebo:

- 6 participants got 300 milligrams (mg) of anifrolumab through 2 injections.
- 6 participants got 300 mg of anifrolumab through an IV needle.
- 6 participants got 600 mg of anifrolumab through an infusion pump.
- 12 participants got a placebo through an injection or IV needle.

Participants stayed at the study center for 3 days during treatment. All participants got the treatment on Day 1 after they were at the study site for 24 hours. They got treatment on Day 1 only and left the study site after Day 3. Participants returned for follow up visits on Days 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 42, 57, and 85.
