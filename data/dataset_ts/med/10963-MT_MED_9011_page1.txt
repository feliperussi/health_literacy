What is happening with the study now?
The study started in January 2019 and ended in May 2019. It included 28 participants in the United Kingdom.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have heart failure. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and make the heart change shape. It can also cause fluid to build up in the arms and legs.
There are treatments for heart failure, but these may cause other medical problems in some patients. The study drug, AZD9977, was designed to work in a different way than current treatments. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn about the safety of different doses of AZD9977 in healthy participants.
