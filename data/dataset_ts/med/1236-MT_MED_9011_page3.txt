Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the study started, the doctors:
• conducted a physical examination of the participants
• assessed the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG
• collected blood and urine samples
• inquired about the medical history of the participants, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking
During the study, the participants took 5 benralizumab treatments through the auto-injection device. All 5 treatments contained 30 milligrams, also known as mg, of benralizumab.
The participants took benralizumab once every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The first 3 treatments were taken at the study site, and the last 2 treatments were taken at home.
For the first treatment, the doctors administered the benralizumab injection at their study site. The doctors did this so that the participants could ask any questions before they or their caregivers gave an injection.
For the last 4 treatments, either the participants or their caregivers could administer the benralizumab injections. Two of these last 4 treatments were taken at home.
At the end of the study, the participants visited their study site twice for follow-up visits over the course of 12 weeks. During those visits, the doctors assessed their overall health and asked how they were feeling.
