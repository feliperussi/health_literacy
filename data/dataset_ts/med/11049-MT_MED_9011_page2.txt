Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of Japanese people with advanced solid tumors that either did not respond to standard therapy or did not have a standard therapy that existed for them.
The study included 10 participants in Japan.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with advanced solid tumors. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
A "solid" tumor is a type of cancer that starts in an organ of the body.
"Advanced" usually means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or has grown beyond the organ where it started. The study drug, AZD4635, is being developed to treat some cancers, including advanced solid tumors.
