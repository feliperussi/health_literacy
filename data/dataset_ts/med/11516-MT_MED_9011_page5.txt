After the patients got study treatment, they visited their study doctors 3 times. If they had already left the hospital, the patients visited their study site. If the patients were still in the hospital, the study doctors visited them. This part of the study lasted for up to 17 days. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the patients.

What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each patient had might be different and are not in this summary.

How much of acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when given by a nasogastric tube?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the patients throughout the study.

In these samples, the study doctors measured:
- the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood during the study
- the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood during the study

Since the study ended early, the researchers could not tell if a nasogastric tube had an effect. But overall, the researchers found that both the average total amount and the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were similar to the results from previous studies of acalabrutinib. These previous studies included healthy people and patients with blood cancers.
