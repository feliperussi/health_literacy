How has this study helped patients and researchers?

This study helped researchers learn more about how well durvalumab, when given alone or with another treatment, works in participants with early stage NSCLC. Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.

Further clinical studies with durvalumab, oleclumab, and monalizumab are planned.
