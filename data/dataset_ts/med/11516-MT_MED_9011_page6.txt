What signs and symptoms did the patients have during this study? To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and after the patients got acalabrutinib.

The doctors did physical exams and tested the patients' blood and urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check the patients' heart health and measured the lung function of the patients. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of these tests and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these to be meaningful.

The study doctors also kept track of the "adverse events" that the patients had. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that patients have during a study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.

The adverse events that the patients had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of patients, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.

What medical problems happened during this study? The medical problems patients have during clinical studies that the study doctors think might be related to the study treatment are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
