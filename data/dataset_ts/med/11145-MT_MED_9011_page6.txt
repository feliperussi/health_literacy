What treatments did the participants receive? In this study, the participants received 1 of the following treatments:
- AZD4635 with durvalumab
- AZD4635 with oleclumab
The participants took AZD4635 as capsules by mouth. Both durvalumab and oleclumab were given through a needle into a vein. This is known as an intravenous infusion, also called an "IV infusion". The doses of AZD4635, durvalumab, and oleclumab were measured in milligrams, also known as "mg". This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was receiving.
If a participant met the requirements for only 1 treatment group, they were assigned to that group. For participants who met the requirements for more than 1 group, a computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant received. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the participants received.
