Clinical Study Results
During the study, the participants visited the study site 2 times in Part 1, and 2 times in Part 2. At the first visit, the participants got their inhaler, and the doctors checked the participants' health. At the second visit, the doctors did an MRI to check the amount of blood in different parts of the participants' hearts. At this visit, the doctors also checked the participants' health.
After Part 1, the participants waited 1 to 3 weeks before starting Part 2. This was done so that all of the study treatment could completely leave their bodies.
All the participants took part in both parts of the study, but they took GFF and the placebo in a different order.
Two weeks after participants took the last study treatment, the doctors called the participants to see how they were feeling.
The chart below shows how the study was done.
