How has this study helped patients and researchers?

This study helped researchers learn more about how much budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate got into the blood of healthy male participants when taken using BGF MDIs containing different propellants. Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.

Further clinical studies looking for the propellant that works best in BGF MDIs are planned.
