Clinical Study Results

Why was the research needed?

Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients who have asthma. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.

Asthma is a condition that causes a person's airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. This can lead to several symptoms, including chest pain, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Currently, there is no cure for asthma.

There are several inhaled treatments that doctors use to help patients control their asthma symptoms. But these treatments may take a long time to work, and they may not help some patients.

The study drug, AZD1402, is an inhaled treatment that is being developed to help control asthma symptoms. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how AZD1402 acts in the body when taken in different forms and doses.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How did the AZD1402 treatments act in the body?
- Did the AZD1402 treatments have a taste or smell?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that would further help researchers learn if AZD1402 improves the health of people who have asthma.

The researchers asked for the help of healthy men who did not have asthma. The participants in this study were between 20 and 47 years old when they joined.
