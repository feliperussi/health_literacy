What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took different combinations of AZD9567, prednisolone, and a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug. This study had 3 treatment groups:
- Participants in Group 1 took a high dose of AZD9567 and prednisolone
- Participants in Group 2 took a low dose of AZD9567 and prednisolone
- Participants in Group 3 took a placebo and a very low dose of prednisolone
Each group had 2 parts. During Part 1, the participants stayed at the study site for 6 days and took their treatment, called "Treatment 1," for 3 days. Then, they stayed at home and took no treatments for 3 weeks. This was done so that the treatment could leave the participants' bodies before Part 2 of the study. During Part 2, the participants stayed at the study site for 6 days and took their second treatment, called "Treatment 2," for 3 days.
This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, researchers, study doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant was taking, or the order in which the participants took their study treatments. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment the participants took so they could create a report of the study results.
This was a "double placebo" study. This means that the participants took both a tablet and a liquid study treatment at the same time. One of these treatments was a placebo and the other was AZD9567, prednisolone, or a placebo. None of the participants, researchers, and study doctors knew whether the tablet or liquid was a placebo, or if both were a placebo.
