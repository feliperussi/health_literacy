Clinical Study Results

What medical problems did the participants have?
The medical problems that participants have during clinical studies that the doctors think might be related to the study treatments are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.

The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.

How many participants had serious adverse reactions?
None of the participants had serious adverse reactions in this study. None of the participants died during the study.

How many participants had adverse reactions?
There were 8.7% of participants who had adverse reactions during the study. This was 2 out of 23 participants.

- 1 participant had 2 adverse reactions while taking GP MDI. These were problems breathing when moving the body and an increase of mucus in the lungs.
- 1 participant had an adverse reaction of worsening COPD while taking FF MDI.

There were 4.3% of participants who left the study early because of an adverse reaction they had during the study. This was 1 out of 23 participants. The adverse reaction happened while the participant was taking FF MDI.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how GP MDI and FF MDI work to treat participants with COPD. It also helped them learn more about using the FRI to look at airway volume and airway resistance.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.

Further clinical studies comparing GP MDI and FF MDI are not planned at this time.
