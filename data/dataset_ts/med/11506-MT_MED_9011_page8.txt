The researchers then calculated an average for each of these measurements. The researchers compared the results for each of the study drugs when the participants used the BGF MDIs with the 3 different propellants.

Overall, the researchers found that the average highest amounts of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate that got into the participants’ blood were similar when the study drugs were taken using BGF MDIs with different propellants.

Additionally, the researchers found that the average total amounts of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate in the participants’ blood until the amounts could no longer be measured were similar when the study drugs were taken using BGF MDIs with different propellants.

Finally, the researchers found that the average total amounts of budesonide and formoterol fumarate in the participants’ blood were similar when the study drugs were taken using BGF MDIs with different propellants. There were not enough results collected for the researchers to know for sure if the average total amount of glycopyrronium in the participants’ blood over time was different when the study drugs were taken using BGF MDIs with different propellants.

Did the participants notice any differences in taste when taking the study drugs?

Overall, the participants did not notice any differences in taste when taking the study drugs using BGF MDIs with different propellants.

To answer this question, the study doctors asked the participants to complete a survey about how the study drugs tasted when taken using BGF MDIs with different propellants.
