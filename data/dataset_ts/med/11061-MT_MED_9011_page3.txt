What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:

- How much AZD5718 was found in the participants' urine and faeces?
- How much AZD5718 got into the participants' blood?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD5718 helps improve the health of people with heart disease.

What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took a single dose of AZD5718 as a liquid by mouth. The dose that each participant took had a low amount of radioactivity in it. This made it easier for the researchers to monitor how AZD5718 acted in the participants' bodies.

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.

The participants stayed overnight at their study site for at least 9 days, and up to 11 days if the study doctors had more tests to do. They took AZD5718 on Day 2 of their stay at the study site.
