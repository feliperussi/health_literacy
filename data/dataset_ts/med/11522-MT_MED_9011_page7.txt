What happened during this study?
The study started in November 2017 and ended in September 2021.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This visit happened up to 1 month before the participants took the study
treatment. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join
the study. They also:
- did physical exams and asked about the participants' medications and any
medical problems they were having
- took images of the participants' cancer using either CT or MRI scans
- took a small sample of each participant's bone marrow, also known as a
bone marrow biopsy and aspirate
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also
called an ECG
While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
up to 20 times. This part of the study lasted for about 12 months. At these visits,
the study doctors did physical exams and ECGs, and took blood and urine
samples. After 12 months, the study researchers decided that some participants
could continue to take their study treatment until their disease got worse.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site
1 time. This visit happened up to 1 month after the participants stopped taking
study treatment. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the
participants. The study doctors also followed up with the participants after this
visit by telephone calls or clinic visits every 3 months.
