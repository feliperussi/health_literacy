Clinical Study Results

What were the results of the study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.

Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment change.

There was 1 participant who left the study before the researchers could measure and compare the study results. This participant left because they did not follow the study guidelines. So, the below results are for only 66 of the 67 participants.

How did the study treatments act in the body?

To answer this question, the researchers measured and compared the amount of budesonide in the blood after treatment.

The researchers measured:

- The amount of budesonide in the blood during treatment. This was measured in picogram hours per milliliter, also called pg*h/mL.
- The amount of budesonide in the blood during the 24 hours after treatment. This was measured in pg*h/mL.
- The highest amount of budesonide in the blood during the 24 hours after treatment. This was measured in picograms per milliliter, also called pg/mL.
- How long it took for budesonide to reach its highest amount in the blood. This was measured in hours.

Overall, the researchers found that the amounts of budesonide in the blood were lower when the participants took budesonide combined with albuterol sulfate compared to when they took Pulmicort, which contained only budesonide. They also found that it took a similar amount of time for budesonide to reach its highest amount in the blood when the participants took budesonide combined with albuterol sulfate compared to when they took Pulmicort, which contained only budesonide.
