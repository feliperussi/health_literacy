Clinical Study Results

What happened during the study?

The chart below shows how the study was done. 

Before getting treatment:
- The doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study.
- The doctors: In Parts A and B
  - checked the overall health of participants 
  - took blood and urine samples 
  - took samples of the tumor 
  - checked participants’ heart health using an echocardiogram, also called an ECG
  - measured the size of tumor using a CT scan

During the study:
- The doctors checked the health of the participants 28 days later. This included:
  - taking vital signs
  - did CT scans
  - testing the health of the heart using an ECG
  - checking the size of the tumor

After getting treatment:
- The doctors checked the health of the participants.

Part A:
- The doctors also checked whether some of the participants had any medical problems for 250 days after their last dose of fulvestrant.
- The 37 participants visited the study site an average of 14 times during Cycles 1–5.
- used a needle to take a some of the tumor tissue to examine, also called tumor biopsy
- tested the health of the heart using an echocardiogram, also called ECHO, or a multigated acquisition scan, also called MUGA

Part B:
- The 17 participants visited the study site an average of 13 times during Cycles 1–5.
- The doctors also checked the health of participants every before 2 months until cancer worsened, then every 3 months after that.

What were the results of the study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

Did the study drugs affect the participants’ safety results?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants’ safety results after they took the study drugs.

To answer this question, the doctors compared the results of the tests and measurements they did before the participants took the study drugs, and throughout the study.
