Clinical Study Results
While the participants got study treatment, they visited the study site up to 11 times. The study doctors checked the participants’ health and did these same tests and measurements as mentioned above throughout the study.
At some visits, the participants stayed at the study site for several days.
When the participants visited the study site, the study doctors or study staff gave them their injections and checked their glucose levels. When the participants were at home, they took their injections once a day and wore their CGM device the whole time. They also kept track of any medical problems in a diary.
After the participants finished getting study treatment, they visited their study site another 3 times. At some of these visits, the study doctors:
- did a physical exam, measured the participants’ weight, and checked vital signs
- took blood and urine samples
- did an ECG
- asked about the participants’ health and any medications they were taking
