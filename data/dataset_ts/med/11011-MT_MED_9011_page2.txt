Clinical Study Results

Why was the research needed?

Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have asthma. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.

Asthma is a condition that causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. This can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing.

There are several treatments that doctors use to help people manage their asthma symptoms. But these treatments may not work for some people and may cause medical problems.

The study drug, AZD7594, is being developed to help people who have asthma control their asthma symptoms. In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how the body gets rid of AZD7594 and how AZD7594 acts in the body.

There were 2 forms of AZD7594 in this study: an inhaled form and a form given through a needle into a vein. This second form is known as intravenous treatment, also called IV treatment.

The researchers in this study added a "tracer" to the IV form of AZD7594. Researchers use tracers to keep track of a study drug as it moves throughout the body. Tracers allow researchers to better understand how a drug acts in the body and how the body gets rid of the drug.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:

- How did the IV tracer leave the body?
- How did the 2 forms of AZD7594 act in the body?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done that help find out if AZD7594 improves the health of people who have asthma.
