How did the different forms of AZD9977 act in the blood?
To answer this question, the doctors took blood samples from the participants after they took each form of AZD9977 in Part A. They measured:
- the average total amount of AZD9977 in the blood over time
- the average amount of AZD9977 in the blood 24 hours after the participants took treatment
- the average total amount of AZD9977 in the blood, up to 24 hours after the participants took treatment
- the average total amount of AZD9977 in the blood, up to the last blood sample taken during the treatment
- the average highest amount of AZD9977 in the blood
Overall, the researchers found that these amounts were highest when the participants took 300 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1. So, the participants in Part B took this form.
How did AZD9977 act in the blood when taken with and without food?
To answer this question, the doctors did the same blood measurements in Part B as they did in Part A. The researchers compared the amounts of AZD9977 in the blood:
- after the participants took 300 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 without food during Part A
- after the participants took 300 mg of AZD9977 in Capsule 1 with food during Part B
