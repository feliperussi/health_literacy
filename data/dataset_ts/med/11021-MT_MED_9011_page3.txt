Clinical Study Results

What happened during the study?
Before the participants took treatment, they visited their study site 1 time over the course of about 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
- Did a physical examination and checked the participants’ vital signs.
- Took blood and urine samples.
- Checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
- Checked the participants’ lung health.
- Asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking.

During the study, the participants visited their study site 2 times. Each visit lasted about 24 hours.

At the first visit, the participants took 1 of the below inhaled treatments:
- 80 μg of budesonide combined with 90 μg of albuterol sulfate.
- 90 μg of Pulmicort, which contained only budesonide.

After the first visit, there was a "washout period" of at least 3 days before the next visit. During this time, the participants did not take any study treatment. This was done so that the study treatment could be "washed out" of their bodies before they took the next treatment.

After the washout period, the participants visited their study site again. At this visit, they took the study treatment that they did not take during the first visit.

Throughout the study, the researchers continued checking the participants' health and asking them how they were feeling.

About 1 week after the participants took their second treatment, they visited their study site 1 final time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the participants' health and asked them how they were feeling.
