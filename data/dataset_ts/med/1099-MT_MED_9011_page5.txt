Highest amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva
Researchers measured the average highest amount of AZD2014 in the blood and saliva in nanograms per milliliter of blood or saliva, or ng/mL. This is a way for researchers to measure the highest amount of drugs in blood and saliva. 
The chart below shows the highest amount of the drug in the blood and saliva.

Time it took for AZD2014 to reach its highest amount in the blood and saliva
Researchers also measured the median amount of time in hours, or h, that it took for AZD2014 to reach its highest amount in the blood and saliva. The median is the amount of time halfway between the shortest time and the longest time it took for AZD2014 to reach its highest amount in the blood and saliva. 
The chart below shows this amount of time.
