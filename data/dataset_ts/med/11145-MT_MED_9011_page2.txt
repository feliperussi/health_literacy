Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat prostate cancer. Before a treatment can be approved for people to receive, researchers do clinical studies to find out if it works and how safe it is.
What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study received 1 of the following treatments:
- AZD4635 with durvalumab
- AZD4635 with oleclumab
What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How many participants’ tumors disappeared or shrank after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
Overall, the researchers found that after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab:
- 1 out of 20 participants had their tumors disappear. This was 5.0% of participants.
- None of the participants’ tumors shrank.
Overall, the researchers found that after receiving AZD4635 with oleclumab:
- None of the participants’ tumors disappeared.
- None of the participants’ tumors shrank.
Only some of the participants from each group were able to be included in this calculation.
- How many participants’ prostate-specific antigen levels decreased significantly after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
Prostate-specific antigen, also called "PSA", is a protein made by the prostate that is related to prostate cancer.
Overall, the researchers found that after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab:
- 1 out of 28 participants had their PSA levels decrease significantly. This was 3.6% of participants.
Overall, the researchers found that after receiving AZD4635 with oleclumab:
- 1 out of 30 participants had their PSA levels decrease significantly. This was 3.3% of participants.
