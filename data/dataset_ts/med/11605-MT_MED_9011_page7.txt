How many participants who received acalabrutinib with obinutuzumab responded to treatment? In this trial, researchers wanted to find out how many participants in Group 1 and Group 2 responded to treatment after 1 year. “Responding” meant that their cancer was improving. The trial doctors measured the participants’ response to treatment by monitoring their health during the trial. Group 1 had already tried treatment for their cancer. Group 2 had not had any treatment before joining this trial. All of the participants in these 2 groups received acalabrutinib with obinutuzumab.
