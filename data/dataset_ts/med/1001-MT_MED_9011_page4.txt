Clinical Trial Results

What were the study results?

Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions the researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients.

How did the combination tablet of dapagliflozin and metformin together act compared to dapagliflozin and metformin alone?

Researchers from an analytical laboratory took blood samples to compare the effects of the 10 mg of dapagliflozin + 1000 mg of metformin together to the 10 mg tablet of dapagliflozin and the two 500 mg tablets of metformin.

Researchers measured the average amount of study drugs in participants’ blood using nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). This is a scientifically accepted unit of measure. 

Researchers found that participants had similar average amounts of dapagliflozin in their blood when they took the 10 mg of dapagliflozin + 1000 mg of metformin together compared to the 10 mg tablet of dapagliflozin alone. They found similar results when they also looked at the average amount of metformin they took in the 10 mg of dapagliflozin + 1000 mg of metformin together compared to the two 500 mg tablets of metformin alone.
