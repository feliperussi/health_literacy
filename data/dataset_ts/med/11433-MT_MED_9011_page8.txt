What medical problems happened during this study? This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to AZD4635. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care. These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by AZD4635. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for AZD4635. The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study. There was 1 participant who was a non-smoker who stopped taking study treatment in Part 2 before they got AZD4635. This was due to an adverse reaction thought to be related to fluvoxamine. So, the results for the non-smokers below are for 13 out of the 14 participants in that group. None of the other participants stopped taking study treatment due to adverse reactions.
