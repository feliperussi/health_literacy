Clinical Study Results
What happened during the study?
Before the participants got study treatment, they visited their study site once, up to 4 weeks before the study started. At this visit, the doctors checked the overall health of the participants to make sure that they could join the study. The doctors:
- did a physical exam
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an ECG
- took blood and urine samples
- did a blood test to make sure the participants did not have tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, or were pregnant
- checked the participants' lupus symptoms
- reviewed the participants' medications, including ones they were taking for lupus

Some participants also needed a chest X-ray to see if they could join the study. While the participants got study treatment, they visited the study site once every 4 weeks for a total of 14 visits. At the first 13 visits, the doctors gave the participants anifrolumab or the placebo through IV infusion. At each visit, the doctors also:
- did a physical exam and checked the participants' overall health
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' skin for signs of lupus and checked their joints to see if they were tender or swollen

Throughout the study, the doctors asked the participants to complete different questionnaires about how they were feeling.
