What medical problems happened during this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drugs.
These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
The results for medical problems were not affected by the study drugs being given by a nurse instead of being taken by the participants themselves. So, the results below are for all 47 participants in the study.
