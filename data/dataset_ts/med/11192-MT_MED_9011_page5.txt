What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, all of the participants took BFF MDI and BFF DPI.
There were 2 groups of participants. This study was a "crossover" study. A crossover study means that all of the participants took the same 2 treatments, but in a different order. The participants took each treatment twice a day for 1 week.
In between taking each study treatment, the participants had a "wash-out" period where they did not take any BFF to let it clear from their system.
This was an "open-label" study. This means that the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took first. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
