What were the results of the study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

There were 4 of the 39 participants who did not take any treatment. So, the results below are for 35 of the 39 participants.

How much acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when taken different ways?

To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants throughout the study.

The study doctors measured:

- the average total amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood over the course of treatment
- the average highest amount of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood during treatment

Then the researchers compared the results from when the participants got acalabrutinib through a tube in the nose for Treatment 2 and when they took it by mouth for Treatment 3.

Overall, the researchers found that:

- The average total amounts of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were similar when the participants took Treatment 2 and Treatment 3.
- The average highest amounts of acalabrutinib and its metabolite in the blood were higher when the participants took Treatment 2 compared to when they took Treatment 3.
