What medical problems happened during this study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction. These adverse reactions have been, and will continue to be, reviewed together with all of the available data for the study treatment.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
The results below are for the participants who took at least 1 dose of study treatment and reported if they had any medical problems.
