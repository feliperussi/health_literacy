Clinical Study Results

What happened during the study?
- You visited the study site 6 times.
- Before the study started, the study doctors did a physical examination to make sure you could join the study. They also took blood and urine samples and checked your heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
- During the study, participants took 1 of 3 treatments once a day for 7 days. All 3 treatments included insulin taken as an injection. In the 3 treatment groups, the insulin was taken with a pill containing a low dose of dapagliflozin, a high dose of dapagliflozin, or the placebo.

What were the study results?
- This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions researchers wanted to answer can be found on the website listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on this website.
- Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

How did dapagliflozin act in the body?
Researchers wanted to learn how dapagliflozin acted in the body when it was combined with an insulin injection. So, they measured:
- the average amount of dapagliflozin in the blood
- the highest amount of dapagliflozin in the blood
- how long it took for dapagliflozin to reach its highest amount in the blood
Researchers did not study these measurements for the participants who took the placebo.
In general, researchers found that the average and highest amounts of dapagliflozin in the blood were highest when participants took the high dose of dapagliflozin with insulin.
After taking dapagliflozin combined with insulin once a day for 7 days, it took between 1 to 3 hours for both dapagliflozin doses to reach their highest amount in the blood.

How did dapagliflozin affect the body?
Researchers wanted to learn how the different dapagliflozin doses affected the body when it was combined with an insulin injection. So, they measured how much blood sugar left the body through urine. Researchers compared these sugar levels before treatment to the levels after 7 days of treatment.
Participants who took the 2 different dapagliflozin doses had similar increases in the sugar levels in their urine after 7 days of treatment.
