Clinical Study Results

What happened during the study? Up to 29 days before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site twice. At these visits, the study doctors checked the overall health of the participants to make sure that they could join the study. The study doctors: 
- asked about the participants’ health and about any medications they were taking 
- did a physical exam 
- took blood and urine samples 
- checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG 

The study doctors also did all these same tests and measurements throughout the study.

During the study, the participants in Group 1 of the study visited their study site 1 time at the beginning. Later they stayed overnight at their study site for 9 nights. The chart below shows when the participants stayed at their study site and when they took the study treatments.
