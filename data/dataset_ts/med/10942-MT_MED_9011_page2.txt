Clinical Study Results

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat T2DM in people who are overweight or obese. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and to find out if and how it works.

T2DM is a condition that causes high levels of blood sugar, also called glucose. In people with T2DM, a hormone called insulin does not work as well as it does in people without T2DM. When insulin works properly, it helps keep the blood sugar levels from getting too high. Some people with T2DM are also overweight, which can contribute to their health problems. In people with T2DM, weight loss may help to lower blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of having other health problems.

The study drug, MEDI0382, was designed to lower blood sugar levels by helping the body to produce more insulin. It also slows digestion and reduces appetite, which may lead to some weight loss.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of MEDI0382 in a small number of participants with T2DM who were overweight or obese. They also wanted to find out if it causes any changes to their health.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did MEDI0382 affect the participants' overall health?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

To answer the questions in this study, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with T2DM who were overweight or obese. The participants in this study were 58 to 74 years old.
