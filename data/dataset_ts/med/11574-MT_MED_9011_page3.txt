Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with high levels of a type of cholesterol known as "low-density lipoprotein cholesterol", also called LDL cholesterol or "bad" cholesterol. The participants in this study were 40 to 75 years old when they joined. All of the participants had been diagnosed with high levels of LDL cholesterol and were taking LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs called "statins". Participants were unable to take part if it was known that they had kidney, liver, or metabolism problems. The study included 119 participants in Denmark, Slovakia, and the United States.
