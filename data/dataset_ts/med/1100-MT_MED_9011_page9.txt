Clinical Study Results

What medical problems did participants have during the study?

A medical problem that happens during a study is called an "adverse event". An adverse event that the study doctors think might be related to the study drugs is called an "adverse reaction". This section is a summary of the adverse reactions that the participants had during the study. An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study drugs. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction. This section includes the adverse reactions that the doctors thought were related to AZD2014 and to palbociclib, but not to fulvestrant.
