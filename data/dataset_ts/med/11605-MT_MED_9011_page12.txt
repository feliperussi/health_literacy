What medical problems did the doctors report as possibly related to the trial treatments?

This section is a summary of the medical problems that the participants had during this trial that the doctors reported as possibly related to the trial treatments. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care. The results from several trials are needed to decide if a treatment causes an adverse reaction.

The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this trial.

Did any adverse reactions happen during this trial?

In this trial, the researchers wanted to learn if the medical problems the participants had were related to specific drugs in the treatment they were receiving, because the participants were receiving a combination of the drugs.

The participants in Group 1 and Group 2 all received acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab, so their results are combined.

The participants in Group 3 and Group 4 took acalabrutinib with venetoclax, and also received either obinutuzumab or rituximab. Obinutuzumab and rituximab are similar drugs because they work in a similar way in the body. The results of Group 3 and Group 4 are also combined.
