How has this study helped patients and researchers?
These results helped researchers learn more about how benralizumab works in people with severe asthma that was not well controlled by previous treatment.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Further clinical studies with benralizumab are planned.
