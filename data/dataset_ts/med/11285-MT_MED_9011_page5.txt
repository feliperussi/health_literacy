Compared to 9.6 µg formoterol fumarate only, the participants who took 320 µg budesonide + 160 µg budesonide + 9.6 µg formoterol fumarate had increased lung function before taking a treatment dose than participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself. They were able to exhale an average of 39 mL more air than participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself.
