What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did flat Coca-Cola and rabeprazole affect how much acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood?
- What medical problems happened during the study?
The researchers wanted to learn the answers to these questions before doing other studies to find out if acalabrutinib could help improve the health of people who have COVID-19.
When this study ended, there was information available from other studies in patients with COVID-19. This information showed that acalabrutinib did not help those patients. So, the researchers are not planning to do more acalabrutinib studies in people with COVID-19.
What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took either:
- acalabrutinib as a capsule by mouth with water
- rabeprazole as a tablet and acalabrutinib as a capsule by mouth with flat Coca-Cola
This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
