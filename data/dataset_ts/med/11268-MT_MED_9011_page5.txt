What happened during the study?
The study started in January 2020 and ended in April 2020.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This happened about 4 weeks before the participants took abediterol. At this visit, the study doctors made sure that the participants could join the study. The study doctors:

- Did a physical exam and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having.
- Checked the participants' lung health and measured the amount of air they could breathe out.
- Checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG.
- Took blood and urine samples.
- Showed the participants how to use their dry powder inhaler and nebulizers.

The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants were taking study treatment, they stayed at the study site for 4 days. On day 2, they took their study treatment. Then, they had some blood tests on days 2 through to 4.
This happened a total of 4 times. At each stay, they took the study treatment in a different way.
There was a 2-week break between each stay.
After the participants took their last study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time up to 2 weeks later. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
It was planned for each participant to be in the study for 12 weeks, but the study sponsor made the decision to end the study early. This meant that not every participant had been in the study for 12 weeks.
