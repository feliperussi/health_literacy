Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women who had CKD. The participants were 18 to 93 years old when they joined.
The study included 4,304 participants in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic kidney disease, also called CKD. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.
In healthy people, the kidneys help the body to control and remove fluid and unnecessary substances in the urine. In people who have CKD, the kidneys cannot do this as well as they should. This can lead to medical problems that can sometimes be serious. Kidney-related and heart-related medical problems are common with CKD, and kidney function can worsen. This can increase the risk of so-called end-stage kidney disease, also called ESKD. ESKD means that a person's kidneys can no longer remove sufficient amounts of extra substances from the body.
People with ESKD may need dialysis treatment, which is like an artificial kidney, or a kidney transplant to help manage their CKD.
The study drug, dapagliflozin, is currently used to treat people who have type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin works by helping the kidneys remove blood sugar through the urine. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn if dapagliflozin could help prevent people's CKD from getting worse regardless of whether they had type 2 diabetes or not.
