Study Title: A study to learn how AZD5718 acts in the blood of healthy participants

Thank you!
Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD5718.
AstraZeneca AB sponsored this study and believes it is important to share the results. An
independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study
results.
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the study
doctor or staff at your study site.

Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men and women. The participants in this study
were 22 to 54 years old when they joined.
The study included 14 male participants in the United Kingdom.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart disease. Before a drug can be approved
for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
In people with heart disease, blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen are narrowed or
blocked by the build-up of cholesterol and fats. This can block the flow of blood to the heart.
Serious cases of heart disease can cause heart attacks. The study drug, AZD5718, was
developed to treat heart disease.
In this study, the researchers wanted to find out how much AZD5718 got into the blood of healthy
participants at 3 different doses. Learning how different doses act in the blood helps researchers
decide what dose to give participants in future studies.
