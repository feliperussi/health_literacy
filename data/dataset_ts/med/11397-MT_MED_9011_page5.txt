What happened during the study?

The study started in May 2020 and ended in June 2020.

Before the participants took treatment:

- 1 visit
- The study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study
- The study doctors:
  - asked the participants about their medical history, how they were feeling, and what medicines they were taking
  - did a physical examination
  - took blood and urine samples
  - tested the participants for COVID-19, also called an ECG (electrocardiogram)

About 4 weeks

While the participants took treatment:

- 3 visits
- The participants stayed at their study site for 4 days during each visit.
- The participants took 1 treatment during each visit:
  - 17 participants took Treatment 1, then Treatment 2, then Treatment 3
  - The study doctors continued checking the participants' health and asking them how they were feeling.
  - 18 participants took Treatment 2, then Treatment 3, then Treatment 2 again
- The participants did not take any treatment for about 1 week in between visits.
- This was done so that the treatments could be "washed out" of their bodies before they took the next treatment.

About 5 weeks

After the participants took treatment:

- 1 visit
- The doctors checked the health of the participants.
