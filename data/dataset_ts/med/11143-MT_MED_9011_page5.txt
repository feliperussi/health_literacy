What happened during this study?
The study started in August 2019 and ended in June 2021.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site within the 28 days before starting study treatment. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- Did physical exams and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having.
- Checked how well the participants were able to do their daily activities.
- Took blood and urine samples.
- Took pictures of the participants' tumors using CT or MRI scans.
- Checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an "ECG".
- Checked how well the participants' hearts were pumping blood using an echocardiogram, also called an "ECHO" or a multigated acquisition scan, also called a "MUGA" scan.
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study, although ECHO or MUGA scans were only done if study doctors felt they were necessary.
While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site up to 4 times in the first cycle, and then 1 time every cycle until they stopped taking study treatment.
When the participants stopped taking study treatment, they visited their study site 1 additional time so the study doctors could check their health.
About 30 days after the participants stopped taking study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
