What happened during this study?
The study started in July 2020 and ended in August 2020. Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- did a physical exam and asked about the participantsâ€™ medications and any medical problems they were having
- did a test for COVID-19
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG

The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study. |
