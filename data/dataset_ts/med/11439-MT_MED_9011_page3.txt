Purpose of the study: The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were: 
- Did taking cyclosporine or rifampicin together with verinurad affect how much verinurad remained in the participantsâ€™ blood during the study? 
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study? 

Treatments given to participants: 
- Treatment 1: verinurad with allopurinol 
- Treatment 2: verinurad with allopurinol and cyclosporine 
- Treatment 3: verinurad with allopurinol and rifampicin 

Participants took all three treatments in the order shown above. They took verinurad and cyclosporine as capsules by mouth, and the other drugs as tablets by mouth.

The participants in this study took verinurad together with allopurinol, which decreases the amount of uric acid made by the body. Allopurinol is an approved drug that has been used in other clinical studies with verinurad.
