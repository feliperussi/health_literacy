Thank you!

Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the auto-injection device containing benralizumab. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about using benralizumab in an auto-injection device to help people with asthma.

AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you.

If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.

What is happening with the study now?

The participants were in the study for up to about 8 months. But, the entire study took about 10 months to finish.

The study started in November 2016 and ended in August 2017. The study included 121 participants in Canada and the United States.

The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
