This study was a "crossover" study. The participants in the study took the same treatments, but in a different order.
Of the 39 participants, 4 did not take any treatment. So, the chart below includes information for 35 participants.
There were 2 groups of participants:
- Group 1 had 17 participants. This group took Treatment 1, then Treatment 2, and then Treatment 3.
- Group 2 had 18 participants. This group took Treatment 2, then Treatment 3, and then Treatment 2 again.
This was done so that the researchers could compare the results when the participants took acalabrutinib in different ways and with and without rabeprazole.

What was the dose?
- 100 mg of acalabrutinib for Treatment 1
- 100 mg of acalabrutinib for Treatment 2
- 100 mg of acalabrutinib for Treatment 3
- 20 mg of rabeprazole

How was the treatment taken?
- Acalabrutinib in flat Coca-Cola as a liquid through a tube in the nose
- Rabeprazole as a tablet by mouth
