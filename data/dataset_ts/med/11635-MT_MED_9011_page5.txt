What happened during this study?
The study started in March 2021 and ended in September 2021.
The participants were in the study for up to about 2 months. But, the entire study took about 6 months to finish.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site once. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- Did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems they were having
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an “ECG”
- Checked if the participants had COVID-19
