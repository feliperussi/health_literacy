Why was the research needed?
In this study, the researchers wanted to compare how benralizumab acts in the body when it is taken in 2 different injection devices. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during this study.
Benralizumab is an approved drug that is used to treat asthma. Asthma is a disease that can cause swelling in the lungs, which can make it difficult to breathe.
The main question the researchers wanted to answer in this study was:
- How did benralizumab act in the body when taken in 2 different injection devices?
