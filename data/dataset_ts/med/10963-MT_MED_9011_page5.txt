Adverse events
The most common adverse events during the study were skin rash and increase in the levels of enzymes called transaminases in the body. This is a possible sign that the liver is not working as well as it should.

What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the adverse events the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study drug. These adverse events are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
