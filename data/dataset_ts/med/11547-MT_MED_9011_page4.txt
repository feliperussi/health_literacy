Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat anemia in people with CKD.
After a drug is approved for people to receive, researchers do more clinical trials to keep looking at how it works and how safe it is.
CKD is a long-term kidney disease. People who have it slowly lose more and more kidney function over time. The kidneys filter the blood, and they are important for helping to keep the blood healthy and making sure that blood cells have enough iron. Blood cells need iron to be able to carry oxygen around the body.
When CKD is advanced, it is hard for the body to make enough new red blood cells and for the gut to absorb enough iron from food. This is known as anemia. Having anemia can make someone more at risk for infections and can lead to heart and lung problems.
Recombinant human erythropoietin and roxadustat are treatments that are already used for anemia in people with CKD. Recombinant human erythropoietin is also called rHuEPO. But, researchers think that rHuEPO only helps with anemia symptoms and doesn’t prevent the cause of anemia.
Researchers think that roxadustat might prevent anemia by helping to make more red blood cells and helping the gut to absorb more iron from food. In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if roxadustat affected how much iron got into the participants’ blood compared with rHuEPO.
