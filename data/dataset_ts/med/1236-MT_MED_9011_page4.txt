What were the results of the study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary. A full list of the questions the researchers wanted to answer can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary. If a full report of the study results is available, it can also be found on these websites.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

Some of the participants left this study before it ended. So, the researchers could only study the results for some of the 121 participants. Participants took multiple injections during the study, so there were more auto-injection devices used than there were participants.

How did the auto-injection device work?

To answer this question, the researchers:

- Asked the participants and their caregivers if they were able to use the auto-injection devices for the last 2 treatments at home.
- Analyzed the auto-injection devices after the last treatment to make sure they still worked correctly.
- Analyzed the auto-injection devices throughout the study that had been reported as not working correctly.
