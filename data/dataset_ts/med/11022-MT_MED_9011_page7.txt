There were 2 participants who did not get all of their injections. So, the results below include information for 214 out of 216 participants.
How many participants had successful tezepelumab injections?
To answer this question, the researchers calculated the percentage of participants who had successful tezepelumab injections over 20 weeks of getting the study drug. This included injections given by the study doctors, the participantsâ€™ caregivers, or the participants themselves. After each injection, the participants filled out a questionnaire about whether the injection was successful. The participants returned the devices to the study site after use. The researchers looked at the devices and the questionnaires to decide whether the injections were successful. The researchers compared the results for the 2 injection devices.
The researchers found that:
- 91.7% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the accessorized pre-filled syringe had successful injections. This was 100 out of 109 participants.
- 92.4% of the participants who got tezepelumab through the autoinjector had successful injections. This was 97 out of 105 participants.
