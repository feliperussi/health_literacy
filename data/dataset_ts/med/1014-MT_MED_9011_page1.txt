Thank you!

Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the study drug dapagliflozin. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about dapagliflozin to help people with type 1 diabetes.

AstraZeneca K.K. sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study with you and the public. An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.

If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.

What is happening with the study now?

You were in the study for about 15 months. But the entire study took about 21 months to finish.

The study started in October 2015 and ended in June 2017. The study included 151 participants at 29 study sites in Japan.

The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
