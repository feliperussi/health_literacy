What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How many participants' tumors disappeared or shrank after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
- How many participants' prostate-specific antigen levels decreased significantly after receiving AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab?
- What medical problems happened during this study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD4635 with durvalumab or with oleclumab helps improve the health of people with prostate cancer.
