Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
Did anifrolumab plus standard of care decrease inflammation in the kidneys compared to a placebo plus standard of care?
No. To answer this question, the researchers measured the levels of protein in the urine over a 24-hour period.
Sometimes when the kidneys are inflamed or damaged, proteins that normally stay in the kidneys can get into the urine. A high level of proteins leaking into the urine can show ongoing kidney inflammation or permanent kidney damage. A low level of proteins in the urine means that there is little kidney inflammation or damage.
The researchers measured the levels of protein in the participants' urine at the start of the study and after 52 weeks. They then calculated the change in the levels of protein leakage into the urine at 52 weeks of treatment as compared to leakage before treatment for both the anifrolumab and placebo groups. The low and high dose group of anifrolumab were grouped and calculated together.
Overall, for both the anifrolumab and the placebo groups, the researchers found a decrease in inflammation in the kidneys after 52 weeks. The researchers did not find a difference between how much anifrolumab and the placebo decreased inflammation in the kidneys.
