Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks because the participants joined at different times. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- did physical exams and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems they were having
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 3 times. During these visits, the participants stayed overnight for 2 nights.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time, about 3 to 7 days later. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
