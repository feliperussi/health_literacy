Clinical Study Results
Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of men and women with advanced cancer.
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced cancer. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells. Many of these extra cells come together to form tumors, which can start in any part of the body. "Advanced" means that the tumors are unlikely to be completely removed by surgery.
There are treatments available for people who have advanced cancer. But, these treatments may not stop cancer cells from growing or spreading. They may also cause medical problems.
The study drug, MEDI9447, is being developed to help treat cancer. Researchers think that MEDI9447 may be able to help the body's immune system fight cancer cells and keep them from growing or spreading.
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about the safety of MEDI9447 in people who have advanced cancer. They also wanted to study the number of dose limiting toxicities the participants had during the study. A dose-limiting toxicity is a medical problem that is severe enough to stop the study doctor from increasing the participant's dose of study drug. Dose-limiting toxicities are also known as DLTs.
