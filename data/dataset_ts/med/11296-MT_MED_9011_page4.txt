What happened during this study?
The study started in January 2020 and ended in July 2020.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 2 times. This part of the study lasted for 3.5 weeks. At these visits, the study doctors checked to make sure the participants could join the study. The study doctors:
> did a physical exam and asked about the participants’ medications and any medical problems they were having
> took blood and urine samples
> checked the participants’ heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
> asked the participants to wear a device that measured their blood pressure for a period of 24 hours

The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
At these visits, the study doctors showed the participants how to give themselves injections of the study treatment. The participants also started wearing a device to measure sugar levels in their body. This is called continuous glucose monitoring, also known as CGM.
