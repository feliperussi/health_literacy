Does a combined dapagliflozin and metformin tablet work in the same way as separate dapagliflozin and metformin tablets? The study results showed that a combined dapagliflozin and metformin tablet works in the same way as separate dapagliflozin and metformin tablets. To answer this question, the researchers looked at the blood samples taken throughout the study. They wanted to see how the drugs in each treatment group were absorbed into the body and moved through the blood. This is called "pharmacokinetics", also known as PK. If the pharmacokinetics are similar, it means that the different tablets release the drugs into the blood at a similar amount and at a similar rate. The results showed that: 
- The pharmacokinetics for Treatment A were similar to Treatment B.
- The pharmacokinetics for Treatment C were similar to Treatment D.
