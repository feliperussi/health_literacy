The researchers measured the total amount of radioactivity that was found in the participants’ urine and feces. Then, they calculated the percentage based on the original amount of radioactivity that the participants got in Dose 3. Overall, the researchers found that:
- 94.1% of the savolitinib left the participants’ bodies in their urine and feces within 8 days of getting Dose 3.

What medical problems happened during this study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities. The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study doctors think might be related to the study drug are called “adverse reactions”. An adverse reaction is considered “serious” when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care. The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
This study helped researchers learn more about how savolitinib acts in healthy men. Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one study. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Further clinical studies with savolitinib are planned.
