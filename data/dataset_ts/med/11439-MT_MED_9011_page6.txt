Did taking cyclosporine or rifampicin together with verinurad affect how much verinurad remained in the participants' blood during the study?
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that taking either cyclosporine or rifampicin together with verinurad increased the amount of verinurad in the participants' blood.
To answer this question, the researchers took blood samples throughout the study. In these samples, they measured:
- the average of the highest amount of verinurad in the participants' blood
- the average of the total amount of verinurad in the participants' blood over time
Then, the researchers compared the results for each treatment group:
- verinurad with allopurinol
- verinurad with allopurinol and cyclosporine
- verinurad with allopurinol and rifampicin
Overall, the researchers found that the average amounts of verinurad in the participants' blood were higher when they took verinurad and allopurinol with either cyclosporine or rifampicin compared to when they took verinurad and allopurinol alone. So, the researchers concluded that taking either cyclosporine or rifampicin increased the amount of verinurad in the participants' blood.
