Average total amount of AZD5718 over time

The average total amount of AZD5718 over time was measured in units called nmol/L per hour, also known as h•nmol/L. The researchers found that the average total amount of AZD5718 in the blood over time after each dose was:

- 129.6 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 1 of AZD5718
- 392.7 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 2 of AZD5718
- 1362.0 h•nmol/L when the participants took dose 3 of AZD5718

The results for dose 1 of AZD5718 here include only 12 out of the 14 participants. This was because for 2 participants, the amount of AZD5718 in the blood was too low to be measured.
