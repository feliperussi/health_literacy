Overview of this study
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have COVID-19 and need hospital care. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

What treatment did the participants take?
The participants in this study took either:
- Acalabrutinib and "best supportive care", also called BSC
- BSC only

What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did acalabrutinib help the participants stay alive and breathe without help? 
No. Overall, the researchers found that acalabrutinib did not help the participants stay alive and breathe without help.
- What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
There were 15.1% of participants who took acalabrutinib and BSC who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to acalabrutinib during the study. The most common medical problem was a headache.
