How did AZD7594 act in the participants’ bodies?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of AZD7594 in the blood when the participants took the 3 inhaled treatments.
The researchers measured:
- The amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood while taking treatment
- The amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood up to 4 days after taking treatment
- The highest amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood while taking treatment
Then, they compared these amounts from when the participants took the nebulizer treatments to when they took the DPI treatment.
The researchers compared:
- The 0.7 mg AZD7594 nebulizer to the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI
- The 1.6 mg AZD7594 nebulizer to the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI
Overall, the researchers found that these amounts were highest when the participants took 1.6 mg of AZD7594 through a nebulizer. The researchers also found that overall, these amounts were lowest when the participants took 0.7 mg of AZD7594 through a nebulizer.
The 0.7 mg AZD7594 nebulizer compared to the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI
Overall, the researchers found that:
- The amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood while taking treatment was similar when they took the 0.7 mg AZD7594 nebulizer compared to when they took the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI.
- The amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood up to 4 days after taking treatment was lower when they took the 0.7 mg AZD7594 nebulizer compared to when they took the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI.
- The highest amount of AZD7594 in the participants’ blood while taking treatment was similar when they took the 0.7 mg AZD7594 nebulizer compared to when they took the 720 μg AZD7594 DPI.
