Overview of this study

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to detect early changes in the well-being of people with severe asthma after they start getting benralizumab. Before new methods can be approved for people to use, researchers do clinical studies to find out how they work.

What treatments did the participants get?
The participants in this study got benralizumab treatment that had been prescribed by their doctors. They also used 3 new smartphone health apps to measure their well-being and asthma symptoms.

What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did the new apps detect early changes in the participants’ well-being after their first dose of benralizumab?
Only 4 participants completed this study. So, the researchers were not able to conclude whether the new apps could detect early changes in the participants’ well-being after they started getting benralizumab.
- How did the new apps compare with existing methods to measure well-being and asthma symptoms?
Only 4 participants completed this study. So, the researchers were not able to determine how the new apps compared with existing methods.
- What medical problems did the participants have during this study?
The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
