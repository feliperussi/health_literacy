Clinical Study Results
What kind of study was this?
This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other study staff knew what treatment each participant got. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, AstraZeneca found out which treatment the participants got so they could create a report of the study results.
In this study, the participants kept getting their usual lupus treatment, and also got either:
- 300 milligrams, also called mg, of anifrolumab
- a placebo
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who get the drug are actually caused by the drug.
Anifrolumab and the placebo were each given through a needle into a vein. This is called intravenous infusion, also called IV infusion. The IV infusion took about 30 minutes.
A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
There were 11 participants who were not included in the main results. Of the remaining 362 participants, there were 180 participants getting anifrolumab and 182 participants getting a placebo.
