Clinical Study Results
After the participants finished getting the study treatment, some participants joined another anifrolumab study right away. The decision to join the other study was made by the doctors with each individual participant. It also depended on if specific criteria were met. The rest of the participants stopped getting anifrolumab and visited the study site 2 more times.
At these visits, the doctors checked their overall health and took blood and urine samples. They checked the participants' lupus symptoms and asked them to complete the questionnaires.
