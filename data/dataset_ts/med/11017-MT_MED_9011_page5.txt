Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a different way to treat people who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, also called HFrEF. Researchers already did studies that showed dapagliflozin worked for the people with HFrEF who participated in those studies.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if dapagliflozin improved how a large number of participants with HFrEF felt and functioned in their everyday lives. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

HFrEF happens when the heart is too weak to pump as much blood as it normally would each time it beats. This means that the heart cannot pump as much blood around the body as it normally would.

Heart failure is a long-lasting condition that can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, and swelling of certain tissues. In serious cases of heart failure, there is an increased risk of other heart problems, and of death.

The study treatment, dapagliflozin, is used as a treatment for people with type 2 diabetes and also for people with HFrEF.
