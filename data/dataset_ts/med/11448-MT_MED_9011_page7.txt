In Part 2, while the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 4 times. At each visit, they:
- stayed at their study site overnight for 4 nights
- took a different study treatment
During Part 2, the participants took 4 different study treatments.
Between visits to their study site, the participants did not get any treatment for at least 3 days. This was done so that the study treatment could be "washed out" of their bodies before they took the next treatment.
About 7 to 10 days after the participants took their last study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants and did blood tests for some participants.
