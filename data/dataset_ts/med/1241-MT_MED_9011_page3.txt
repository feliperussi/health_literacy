Who took part in the study?

The researchers asked for the help of men and women with mild allergic asthma, also called allergen-induced asthma. The participants in this study were 19 to 64 years old when they joined. The participants all had asthma symptoms due to environmental allergies. These are allergies caused by triggers that are inhaled, such as plant pollens and pet dandruff or fur.

The study included 46 participants in Canada.

Why was the research needed?

Researchers are trying to find out how benralizumab works in the body. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take for different medical problems, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out if benralizumab works in a number of participants with allergic asthma. They also wanted to find out if the participants had any medical problems during the study.

Allergic asthma is triggered by having an allergic reaction in the lungs. The specific trigger that an individual person is allergic to is called an allergen. Allergic asthma happens when the allergen gets in the lungs and the cells in the immune system try to attack it, which leads to inflammation. One of these types of cells involved in inflammation is called an eosinophil. People with allergic asthma may have too many eosinophils in their lungs, which can lead to inflammation and tightening of the airways during an asthma attack. The eosinophils can also cause the lung mucus to increase and become thick and heavy. The inflammation, tightened airways, and mucus all make it hard to breathe and result in asthma symptoms.
