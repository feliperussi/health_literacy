Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments.
These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether treatments cause an adverse reaction.
