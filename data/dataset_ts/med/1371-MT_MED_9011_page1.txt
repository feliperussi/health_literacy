Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial for the study drug naloxegol, also known as Movantik. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how naloxegol works to help people who get constipation from taking opioids for chronic pain.
  
AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study with you and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the study results for you. We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
  
If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.
  
What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 6 weeks. But, the entire study took about 5 months to finish.
  
The study started in March 2017 and ended in August 2017. The study included 276 participants in the United States.
  
Some of the participants left the study before it was completed. So, the researchers weren't able to study some of the results for all of the 276 participants.
  
The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the study ended and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
