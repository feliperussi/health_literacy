The researchers also calculated:
- how long it took to reach the highest concentration of tezepelumab in the participants' blood
- how long it took for the concentration of tezepelumab to reduce by half
- how quickly tezepelumab left the participants' blood
- how far tezepelumab spread out in the participants' bodies

The researchers found that these measurements were similar among all of the groups, even though they got different doses of tezepelumab.
