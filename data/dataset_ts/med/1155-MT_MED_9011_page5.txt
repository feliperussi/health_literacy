Clinical Trial Results

Did more participants who got the 1-strain vaccine have certain symptoms in the first 7 and the first 14 days compared to participants who got the placebo? 

No. Researchers also counted the number of participants who reported certain symptoms that researchers expected might occur in the first 7 and first 14 days after getting the 1-strain vaccine or the placebo. These symptoms included:

- Headache: 32 (13.3%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 13 (22.0%) in the placebo group.
- Runny nose: 31 (12.9%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 10 (16.9%) in the placebo group.
- Sore throat: 15 (6.2%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 8 (13.6%) in the placebo group.
- Tiredness: 11 (4.6%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 4 (6.8%) in the placebo group.
- Cough: 6 (2.5%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 5 (8.5%) in the placebo group.
- Muscle aches: 4 (1.7%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 3 (5.1%) in the placebo group.
- Chills: 3 (1.2%) in the 1-strain vaccine group; 2 (3.4%) in the placebo group.
- Vomiting: 0 (0.0%) in both the 1-strain vaccine and placebo groups.
