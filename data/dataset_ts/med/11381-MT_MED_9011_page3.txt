What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how AZD4831 passes through the body, breaks down, and leaves the body.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How much AZD4831 left the participants' bodies in their urine and feces?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD4831 improves the health of people who have heart disease.
