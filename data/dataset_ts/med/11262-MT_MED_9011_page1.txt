Who took part in the study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in this study were 23 to 55 years old when they joined.
The study included 16 participants in the United States.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat tumors. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Cancer is a disease that happens when the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form tumors, which can start in any part of the body.
The study drug, savolitinib, is being developed as a treatment for tumors. In this study, the researchers wanted to learn how savolitinib acts in the body when taken with a drug called famotidine.
