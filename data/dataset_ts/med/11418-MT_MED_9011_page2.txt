The researchers asked for the help of healthy participants. 
The study included 10 participants. 

Why was the research needed? 
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works. 
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that causes the airways to narrow. This can make it difficult to breathe. People who have asthma attacks may wheeze, cough, and have shortness of breath. Asthma attacks often happen when there is inflammation in the lungs. 
The study drug, AZD8154, has been developed as a treatment for asthma. AZD8154 was designed to stop several molecules that cause inflammation in the lungs. AZD8154 has already been studied in the form of a mist containing the drug, also known as a "nebulizer suspension". A nebulizer suspension is formed by a nebulizer, which is a device that turns a liquid into a mist. The researchers wanted to learn if a dry powder form of AZD8154 works similarly to the nebulizer suspension form of AZD8154. 
In this study, the researchers compared how much AZD8154 got into the blood of healthy participants when inhaled in 2 different ways: 
- As a nebulizer suspension 
- As a dry powder through an inhaler
