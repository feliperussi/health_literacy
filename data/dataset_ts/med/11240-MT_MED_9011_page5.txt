What happened during this study?
Each participant was in the study for up to 6 weeks. But, the entire study took 5 months to finish. The study started in December 2019 and ended in April 2020.

- answered 2 questionnaires about their asthma symptoms
About 4 weeks after the participants got study treatment, they visited their doctors once more. This was their last day taking part in the study. At this visit, the participants:
