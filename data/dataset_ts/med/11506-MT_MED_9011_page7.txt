What were the results of this study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have more information about the study results.
During the study, there were 23 participants who were given the study treatments by a nurse instead of taking the study treatments themselves. Because this was not how the study was supposed to be conducted, these results were not included.
So, the results for how much of each study drug got into the participants’ blood are for 24 of the 47 participants.
Did BGF MDIs with different propellants affect how much of the study drugs got into the participants’ blood?
Overall, the researchers found that using BGF MDIs with different propellants did not affect how much budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate got into the participants’ blood.
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples throughout the study. In these samples, they measured:
- the highest amounts of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate in the participants’ blood
- the total amounts of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate in the participants’ blood until the amounts could no longer be measured
- the total amounts of budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate in the participants’ blood
