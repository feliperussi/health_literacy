A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant got. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible. Each treatment was given slowly through a needle into a vein. This is known as an IV infusion. The chart below shows the treatments the participants got in Year 1. Anifrolumab plus Placebo plus standard of care standard of care. • 98 participants • 49 participants. • Anifrolumab as an IV infusion • Placebo as an IV infusion. • Standard of care • Standard of care. • Low dose of anifrolumab • Placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. • High dose of anifrolumab once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, then low dose of anifrolumab once every 4 weeks for 40 weeks. What happened during this study? The participants were in the study for up to 116 weeks. But the entire study took about 5 years to finish. The study started in November 2015 and ended in January 2021.
