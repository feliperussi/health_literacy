What happened during this study?
The study started in August 2014 and data collection ended in June 2020. The results shown in this summary were collected during this time, but the study is still continuing.

Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site once. This part of the study lasted for up to 3 weeks. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- did physical exams and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having
- took blood, urine, and bone marrow samples
- checked the participants' heart health with an electrocardiogram, also called an "ECG"
- took images of the participants' swollen lymph nodes using CT or PET scans
- used a questionnaire to learn about the effect DLBCL was having on the participants' daily life and well-being

The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the study.

While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site at least 11 times. This part of the study lasted for 1 year. The participants could stay in the study after this, but the length of time was different between people. The participants stayed in the study until they decided to leave, their cancer got worse, or for as long as their study doctors thought the study treatment was helping their cancer.

After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site once. This part of the study lasted for up to 1 month. At this visit, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
