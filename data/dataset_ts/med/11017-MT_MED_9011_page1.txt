Thank you! Thank you for taking part in the clinical study for the study treatment dapagliflozin. You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about dapagliflozin to help people who have a type of heart failure called HFrEF. HFrEF stands for 'heart failure with reduced ejection fraction'. HFrEF happens when the heart is too weak to pump blood around the body normally.
