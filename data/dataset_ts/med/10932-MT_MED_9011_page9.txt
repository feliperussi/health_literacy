Clinical Study Results
What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatments. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatments. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.
The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
One of the participants left the study before the researchers could study his or her medical problems. So, the below results are for only 90 of the 91 participants.
