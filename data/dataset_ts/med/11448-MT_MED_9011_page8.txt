Did taking acalabrutinib as a capsule or as a tablet affect how much got into the blood?

Overall, the researchers found that both the average total and average highest amounts of acalabrutinib in the blood were similar when the participants took acalabrutinib as a capsule or a tablet in Part 1.

To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants in Part 1 throughout the study.

In these samples, the study doctors measured:
- the average total amount of acalabrutinib in the blood during the study
- the average highest amount of acalabrutinib in the blood during the study

Then, the researchers compared the results from Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 of Part 1. For these treatments, the participants took:
- acalabrutinib as a capsule after not eating for 10 hours or more
- acalabrutinib as a tablet after not eating for 10 hours or more
