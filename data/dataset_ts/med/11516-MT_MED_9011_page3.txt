The researchers in this study wanted to learn more about how acalabrutinib and its "metabolite" act in the blood when given by a nasogastric tube with a proton pump inhibitor in patients with COVID-19 who need hospital care. A metabolite is a substance that the body makes when it breaks down a drug. The body removes metabolites through fluids, such as urine or sweat.

What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about how acalabrutinib acts in the blood when given by a nasogastric tube with a proton pump inhibitor in patients with COVID-19 who need hospital care.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- How much of acalabrutinib and its metabolite got into the blood when given by a nasogastric tube?
- What signs and symptoms did the patients have during the study?
- What medical problems did the patients have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if acalabrutinib helps improve the health of people who have COVID-19 and need hospital care.

What treatments did the patients get?
In this study, all of the patients got acalabrutinib, a proton pump inhibitor, and the standard of care for COVID-19. "Standard of care" means the treatment that the medical community thinks is appropriate and widely used for a condition.
This was an "open-label" study. This means the patients, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each patient was getting.
The patients got acalabrutinib as a liquid given by a nasogastric tube. They were planned to get acalabrutinib twice a day for a total of 14 days.
