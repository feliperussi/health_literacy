Clinical Study Results
What adverse reactions did the participants have?
The most common adverse reaction related to naloxegol was stomach pain. The most common adverse reactions that happened in 3 or more participants in either treatment group were:
- Stomach pain: 4.8% (13) with Naloxegol, 2.2% (6) with PEG 3350
- Flatulence: 2.6% (7) with Naloxegol, 2.6% (7) with PEG 3350
- Diarrhea: 3.7% (10) with Naloxegol, 1.1% (3) with PEG 3350
- Upper stomach pain: 3.7% (10) with Naloxegol, 1.1% (3) with PEG 3350
- Nausea: 0.7% (2) with Naloxegol, 1.5% (4) with PEG 3350
- Bloating in stomach: 0.4% (1) with Naloxegol, 1.5% (4) with PEG 3350
- Headache: 1.1% (3) with Naloxegol, 0.0% (0) with PEG 3350

How has this study helped patients and researchers?
The results presented here are from a single study. These results helped the researchers learn if participants who get constipation from taking opioids for pain not related to cancer preferred taking naloxegol compared to PEG 3350, and for what reason.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any changes in treatment.

Further clinical studies with naloxegol are planned.
