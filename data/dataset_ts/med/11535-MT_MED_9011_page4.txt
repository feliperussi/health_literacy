Percentages between 80% and 125% were considered to mean that a similar amount of epoetin alfa was in the blood.
Form A data from 48 patients
Form B data from 48 patients
When comparing Forms A and B to Form D, the researchers found that the average amount of epoetin alfa in the participantsâ€™ blood was:
- 101.5% for Form A
- 115.0% for Form B
