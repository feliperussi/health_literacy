The results below are for participants from both Group 1 and Group 2, who took the 2 study treatments in a different order. There were 4 out of 66 participants who did not take both study treatments. So, the results below are for:
- 65 participants who took acalabrutinib as a tablet
- 63 participants who took acalabrutinib as a capsule

Did the amount of acalabrutinib that got into the participants’ blood differ when it was taken as a tablet compared with a capsule?

No. Overall, the researchers found that taking acalabrutinib as a tablet did not affect the amount of acalabrutinib that got into the participants’ blood compared with when it was taken as a capsule.

To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants throughout the study. In these samples, the study doctors measured:
- The average total amount of acalabrutinib in the participants’ blood during the study
- The average highest amount of acalabrutinib in the participants’ blood during the study

Then, the researchers compared the results after the participants took acalabrutinib as a tablet with the results after they took it as a capsule. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small differences between the groups. But, these differences were too small for the researchers to know if taking acalabrutinib in 2 different ways affected how much of it got into the blood.
