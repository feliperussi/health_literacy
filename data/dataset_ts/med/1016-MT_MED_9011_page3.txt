Clinical Study Results

What kind of study was this?
This was a "double-blind" study. This means none of the participants, doctors, or other AstraZeneca study staff knew what treatment each participant took. Some studies are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the study. When the study ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants took so they could create a report of the study results.

The participants in this study took either dapagliflozin or a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.

The participants took dapagliflozin or the placebo once a day, as tablets. The dose of dapagliflozin was 10 milligrams, also known as mg.

A computer program was used to randomly choose the group each participant was in. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each group is as accurate as possible.

In this study, there were 2,373 participants in the dapagliflozin group and 2,371 participants in the placebo group.

During the study, the participants could continue taking any medication that they were already taking for their heart problems.
