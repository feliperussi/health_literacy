What were the study results?

Below is a summary of the results of some of the questions that researchers asked during this study. It is important to know that researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work best and are safest for patients.

In order to know how a medication works and in whom it works well, researchers ask questions that are answered in studies like this. Here are some of the questions that the researchers had and the results provided by the study in which you took part.

Further clinical studies with benralizumab are ongoing.

Did benralizumab affect how the immune system reacted to the flu vaccine?

Researchers wanted to learn how benralizumab affected the immune system. To do this, researchers gave all participants the 4-strain flu vaccine. Researchers compared the results for all 4 strains. They also compared the results for the participants who got benralizumab injections to the results for participants who got the placebo.

Researchers studied:

- The change in the amount of antibodies in the blood at week 12
- The amount of antibodies in the blood at Week 12
- The percentage of participants who had at least a 4 times increase in the amount of antibodies at Week 12 compared to Week 8
- The percentage of participants who had at least 40 antibodies at Week 12
- The percentage of participants who had at least 320 antibodies at Week 12
