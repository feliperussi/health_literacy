Clinical Trial RESULTS
Researchers from an analytical laboratory also measured the highest amount of the study drugs in participants’ blood at any time. They found that the highest amounts of both dapagliflozin and metformin in the blood were similar when participants took the combined tablet of 10 mg of dapagliflozin + 1000 mg of metformin compared to when participants took the dapagliflozin tablet and the metformin tablet individually.

The chart below shows the highest amount of both study drugs in participants’ blood.

How quickly the study drugs reached participants’ blood
Researchers from an analytical laboratory were also interested in seeing how quickly both study drugs reached the blood circulation in participants’ bodies, known as the rate of absorption. Researchers found that the rate of absorption was similar when participants took the single tablet of 10 mg of dapagliflozin + 1000 mg of metformin together compared to when participants took the separate dapagliflozin tablet and the metformin tablets.
