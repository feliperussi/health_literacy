Clinical Study Results
The figure below shows these results.

Treatment preference of participants:
- No preference: 1.6%
- PEG 3350: 48.0%
- Naloxegol: 50.4%

Why did the participants prefer naloxegol or PEG 3350?
The researchers wanted to learn why the participants preferred taking naloxegol or PEG 3350 to treat their constipation. So, they gave the participants a questionnaire after they completed both treatments and asked them to rate the importance of the following 5 reasons for their preference:
- The drug worked better to relieve their constipation.
- They were able to tolerate the drug better.
- The drug was more convenient for them to take.
- The drug worked quicker.
- The drug worked in the way that they expected it to.

The researchers found that the most frequent reason the participants preferred naloxegol was that it was more convenient for them to take.

In general, the researchers found that the other reasons were chosen about as often among the participants who preferred either naloxegol or PEG 3350.
