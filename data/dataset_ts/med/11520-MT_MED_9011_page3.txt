What was the purpose of this study?
In this study, the researchers wanted to learn more about 4 different combinations of drugs for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This was done to help researchers learn which combinations of drugs are the safest or most effective so they can be used in larger clinical studies.
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have?
- What medical problems did participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if certain treatments help improve the health of people with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
What treatments did the participants get?
In this study, the participants were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups:
- Group 1 got AZD9150 and acalabrutinib
- Group 2 got AZD6738 and acalabrutinib
- Group 3 got Hu5F9-G4, rituximab, and acalabrutinib
- Group 4 got AZD5153 and acalabrutinib
This was an “open-label” study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was getting.
