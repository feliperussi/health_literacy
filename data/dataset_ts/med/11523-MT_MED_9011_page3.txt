Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat DLBCL in adults. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
DLBCL is a type of blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cells called "B lymphocytes." White blood cells are part of the immune system and help fight infections. DLBCL starts in the lymphatic system, which is a part of the body's immune system that helps transport white blood cells across the body. In people who have DLBCL, B lymphocytes grow abnormally and build up in the lymphatic system and around the body. This can cause swollen lymph nodes, pain, and fatigue.
The study drug, acalabrutinib, is used to treat certain types of blood cancers involving B lymphocytes. It works by stopping the cancer cells from growing out of control.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out about the safety of acalabrutinib for participants with a specific type of DLBCL called "activated B-cell".
What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?
The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if acalabrutinib helps improve the health of people who have a specific type of DLBCL.
