Change in lung function over 24 weeks for participants who took 320 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together using MDI

Compared to formoterol fumarate and budesonide only using MDI, the participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function over the 4 hours after taking a treatment dose. They were able to exhale an average of 165 mL more air than participants who took budesonide by itself using MDI.

The difference in the study medicines was too small for the researchers to know if participants who took 160 µg of budesonide and 9.6 µg of formoterol fumarate together using MDI had more increased lung function before taking a treatment dose than participants who took formoterol fumarate by itself using MDI.
