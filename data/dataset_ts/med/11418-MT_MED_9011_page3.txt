What was the purpose of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did inhaling AZD8154 in different ways affect how much AZD8154 got into the participants' blood?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if AZD8154 helps improve the health of people with asthma.

What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants were planned to take the following treatments:
- AZD8154 as a nebulizer suspension
- AZD8154 as a dry powder through an inhaler
- A placebo

A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. The placebo looked the same as the AZD8154 dry powder. Researchers use a placebo to help make sure any of the effects they see in the participants who take the drug are actually caused by the drug.

It was planned for the participants to take all 3 treatments in a different order, with a 2-week wait between each treatment.

A computer program was used to randomly choose the order in which the participants were assigned to take each treatment. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.

This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking.
