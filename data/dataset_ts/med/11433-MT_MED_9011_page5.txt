What happened during the study?
The study started in July 2020 and ended in December 2020.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks, because the participants joined at different times. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- Did a physical exam and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time and stayed overnight at the study site for 16 nights.
After the participants took the last study treatment, the study doctors called them 1 time about 6 to 9 days later. During this call, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
