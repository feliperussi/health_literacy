Thank you!
Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical study for the study drug AZD1419. All the participants helped researchers learn more about using AZD1419 as treatment for people who have asthma.

AstraZeneca sponsored this study and thinks it is important to share the results of the study with the participants and the public. An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP helped prepare this summary of the study results. We hope it helps the participants understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.

If you participated in the study and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site.

What is happening with the study now?
The participants were in the study for up to about 1 year. But the entire study took about 2 years to finish.

The study started in October 2016 and ended in September 2018.

The study included 81 participants in Denmark, Hungary, Poland, and Sweden.

When the study ended, the sponsor reviewed the collected data and created a report of the results. This is a summary of that report.
