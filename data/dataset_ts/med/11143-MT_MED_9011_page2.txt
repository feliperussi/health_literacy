Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of men with prostate cancer. The participants in this study were 49 to 82 years old when they joined.
The participants had prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of the body and could no longer be treated by lowering the levels of a hormone called "testosterone". When they joined the study, the participants had been treated with at least 1 other type of treatment for prostate cancer.
The study included 27 participants. This included 11 participants from Spain and 16 participants from the United States.

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat prostate cancer. Before a drug can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works with existing medicines.
In people with cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells. The extra cells can form tumors and can also spread to other parts of the body.
The study drug, capivasertib, is designed to stop one of the proteins in the body that helps tumors to grow and spread.
