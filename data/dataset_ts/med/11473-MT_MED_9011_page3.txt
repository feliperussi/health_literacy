What was the purpose of this study? The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were: 

- How did taking verinurad and allopurinol in different ways affect how much of each got into the participants' blood? 
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study? 

The answers to these questions are important to know before other studies can be done to find out if verinurad and allopurinol improve the health of people who have chronic kidney disease or heart failure.
