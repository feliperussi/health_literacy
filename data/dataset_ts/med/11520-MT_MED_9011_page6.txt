What were the results of this study?

This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.

Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results. Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

What signs and symptoms did the participants have?

To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and after the participants got their study treatment.

The doctors did physical exams and tested the participants' blood and urine samples to check their overall health. They also did ECGs to check the participants' heart health.

Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in the results of these tests and measurements. But, the researchers did not consider these changes to be meaningful.

The study doctors also kept track of the "adverse events" that the participants had.

An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment.

An adverse event is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care.

Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatments in the study. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.

The adverse events the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants in each treatment group, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
