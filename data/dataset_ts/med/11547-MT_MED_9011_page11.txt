What did researchers learn from this trial?
This trial helped researchers learn more about how roxadustat affects people with low levels of iron in their blood from chronic kidney disease. Overall, the researchers found that there were some differences between how much iron got into the participants' blood after they received roxadustat compared with rHuEPO. But, the differences were too small for the researchers to conclude if roxadustat affected how much iron got into the participants' blood compared with rHuEPO.
Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which treatments work best and are safest. This summary shows only the main results from this one trial. Other trials may provide new information or different results.
At the time this summary was made and approved by the sponsor, further clinical trials with roxadustat were planned.
