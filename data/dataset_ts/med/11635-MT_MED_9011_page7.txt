Did the amount of tacrolimus or cyclosporin that got into the participants’ blood differ when taken with SZC?
To answer this question, the study doctors took blood samples from the participants throughout the study. In these samples, the study doctors measured:
- The average total amount of tacrolimus or cyclosporin in the participants’ blood over time
- The average highest amount of tacrolimus or cyclosporin in the participants’ blood
Then, the researchers compared the results after the participants took tacrolimus or cyclosporin on their own with the results after they took them with SZC.
In the tacrolimus group:
Yes. Overall, the researchers found that taking SZC did affect how much tacrolimus got into participants’ blood:
- The average total amount of tacrolimus in the participants’ blood over time was lower when the participants took tacrolimus with SZC compared to when they took tacrolimus by itself.
- The average highest amount of tacrolimus in the participants’ blood was lower when the participants took tacrolimus with SZC compared to when they took tacrolimus by itself.
In the cyclosporin group:
No. Overall, the researchers found that there were some small changes in how much cyclosporin got into the participants’ blood when they took SZC. But, the differences were too small for the researchers to know if taking cyclosporin on its own, or with SZC, affected how much cyclosporin got into participants’ blood.
