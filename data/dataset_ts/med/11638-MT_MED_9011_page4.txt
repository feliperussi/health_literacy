What happened during this study?
The study started in February 2021 and ended in May 2021.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site once. This part of the study lasted for up to 1 month. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- did physical exams and asked about the participants' medications and any
medical problems they were having
- checked the participants' smoking history
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG
The study doctors also did some of these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they stayed at their study site.
The participants took their first study treatment on Day 3. They waited at least 5 days before taking their second study treatment.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site or
had a phone call with the study doctor. This happened 7 to 10 days after they took
their second study treatment. During this visit or phone call, the study doctors
checked the health of the participants.
