Thank you

It is said that the greatest gift is one which is given anonymously, giving when you do not know whether you will get direct personal benefit.

This is the gift that you have given by taking part in a clinical trial.

It is a brave and selfless act, one that advances medical knowledge and benefits public health.

Thank you for the gift of your participation in clinical research.
