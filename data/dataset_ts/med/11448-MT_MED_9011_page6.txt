What happened during this study?
The study started in June 2020 and ended in January 2021.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. This part of the study lasted for up to 4 weeks because the participants joined the study at different times. At this visit, the study doctors made sure that the participants could join the study. They also:
- did a physical exam and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having
- did a test for COVID-19
- took blood and urine samples
- checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG

The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
During the study, the participants had a breath test on the first day of each study treatment.

In Part 1, while the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 3 times. At each visit, they:
- stayed at their study site overnight for 4 nights
- took a different study treatment

During Part 1, each participant took 3 of the 4 study treatments. For the participants who got Treatment 4, they took rabeprazole at home for 3 days before visiting their study site to get Treatment 4.

Between visits to their study site, the participants did not get any treatment for at least 7 days. This was done so that the study treatment could be "washed out" of their bodies before they took the next treatment.
