What treatments did the participants take?
In this study, the participants took acalabrutinib as a capsule by mouth. The doses of acalabrutinib were measured in milligrams, also known as "mg". The participants took acalabrutinib either once a day or twice a day. This was an "open-label" study. This means the participants, researchers, study doctors, and other study staff knew what each participant was taking. A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is as accurate as possible.
The chart below shows the treatments the researchers planned to study.
