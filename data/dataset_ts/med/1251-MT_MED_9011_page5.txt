Clinical Trial Results

How did anifrolumab act in the body?
Researchers wanted to see how the study drug acted in the body. They wanted to know:

- The average amount of anifrolumab in the blood
- The highest amount of anifrolumab in the blood
- How long it took for anifrolumab to reach its highest amount in the blood

Average amount of anifrolumab in the blood
Researchers measured the average amount of anifrolumab in participants' blood in micrograms each day per milliliter of blood, or µg•day/mL. This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.

Treatment group:
- 300 mg anifrolumab
- 300 mg anifrolumab IV
- 600 mg anifrolumab infusion pump

Highest amount of anifrolumab in the blood
Researchers measured the highest amount of anifrolumab in participants' blood in micrograms per milliliter of blood, or µg/mL. This is a widely accepted scientific unit of measurement.
