What happened during this study?
The study started in January 2020 and ended in March 2021.
Before the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 1 time. There was up to 1 month between this visit and the participants taking the study treatment. At this visit, the study doctors made sure the participants could join the study. They also:
- Did physical exams and asked about the participants' medications and any medical problems they were having
- Took blood and urine samples
- Checked the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram, also known as an "ECG"
The study doctors also did these tests and measurements throughout the study.
While the participants took study treatment, they stayed at the study site for about 2 weeks. The participants took AZD4831 or the placebo once a day for the first 10 days of their visit.
After the participants took study treatment, they visited their study site 4 times. These visits happened up to 10 days after the last treatment visit. At these visits, the study doctors checked the health of the participants.
