Clinical Study Results:
At the end of the study, the researchers found that:

- 93.1% of the participants and their caregivers reported that they had been able to use the auto-injection devices for the 2 treatments at home.
- 96.6% of the auto-injection devices worked correctly at week 16, which was the final treatment at home.
- 1.5% of the auto-injection devices were reported as not working correctly. Researchers thought 7 of these were caused by a mistake made by the user, 1 was a manufacturer defect, and 1 did not work correctly due to other reasons.

What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

This section is a summary of the medical problems the participants had during the study that the study doctors thought might be related to the study treatment. These medical problems are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.

These adverse reactions may or may not be caused by the study treatment. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse reaction.

The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
