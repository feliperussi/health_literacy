Overview of this study

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat active proliferative lupus nephritis.
Before a drug can be approved for people to get, researchers do clinical studies to find out how it works and how safe it is.

What treatment did the participants get?
The participants in this study got either a low or high dose of anifrolumab, or a placebo.
A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it. They also got standard of care treatment. Standard of care is the treatment the medical community thinks is appropriate and widely accepted for a condition.

What were the results of this study?
The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
X Did anifrolumab plus standard of care decrease inflammation in the kidneys compared to a placebo plus standard of care?
To answer this question, the researchers measured the levels of proteins in the urine as a measure of kidney inflammation. Overall, for both the anifrolumab and the placebo group, there was a decrease in inflammation in the kidneys after 52 weeks. The researchers did not find a difference between how much anifrolumab and the placebo decreased inflammation in the kidneys.

X What medical problems happened during this study?
There were 36.6% of participants who had medical problems that the study doctors thought might be related to either anifrolumab or the placebo during the study. This was 53 out of 145 participants. The most common medical problem was herpes zoster infection, also called shingles.

More details about the results of this study are included later in this summary.
