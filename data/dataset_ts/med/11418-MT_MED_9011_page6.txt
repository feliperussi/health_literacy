Did inhaling AZD8154 in different ways affect how much AZD8154 got into the participants’ blood? Overall, a similar amount of AZD8154 got into the participants’ blood when they inhaled AZD8154 in different ways.

To answer this question, the researchers took blood samples from all the participants. The researchers took blood samples before and after the participants got AZD8154 or the placebo, and measured how much AZD8154 was in the participants’ blood. But the number of participants who took each study treatment was too small for the researchers to know if inhaling AZD8154 in different ways affected exactly how much AZD8154 got into the participants’ blood.

What medical problems happened during this study? The medical problems that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.

The medical problems participants have during clinical studies that the study doctors think might be related to the study drug are called "adverse reactions". An adverse reaction is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care. None of the participants had serious adverse reactions.

The adverse reactions that happen in a study may or may not be caused by the study drug. A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse reaction.

The websites listed at the end of this summary may have other information about adverse reactions or other medical problems that happened during this study.
