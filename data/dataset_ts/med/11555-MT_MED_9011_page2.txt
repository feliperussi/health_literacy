Who took part in this study?
The researchers asked for the help of healthy men. The participants in this study were 42 to 58 years old when they joined. The study included 8 participants in the United Kingdom.
Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat cancer. Before a drug can be approved for people to use, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.
Many cancers are caused by changes in different genes. Changes in genes are also known as "mutations". Some mutations can help cells to grow and make more copies of themselves. These "extra" cells can form tumors.
The study drug, savolitinib, was developed to slow the growth of tumor cells that have mutations in a gene called the "MET" gene. Researchers have shown that mutations in the MET gene can make certain types of tumors grow faster.
