Clinical Study Results

Why was the research needed?
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat diseases of the airways and lungs, such as asthma. Before a drug can be approved in a country for people in that country to take, researchers do clinical studies to find out how safe it is and how it works.

Asthma is a common disease of the airways and lungs. Asthma causes the airways to narrow, swell, and create extra mucus. This can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing.

The study drug, benralizumab, is a treatment to help people manage their asthma symptoms. At the time of the study, benralizumab was available as an asthma treatment in several countries but not in China. So, in this study, the researchers wanted to find out about the safety of benralizumab in healthy Chinese participants, and how benralizumab works.

The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this study were:
- Did the participants' safety results change during the study?
- What medical problems did the participants have during the study?

The answers to the questions in this study and other studies in China are important to know. These answers help researchers in China find out if benralizumab improves the health of people who have asthma and other diseases of the airways and lungs.

The researchers asked healthy Chinese men and women to participate in this study. The participants in this study were 18 to 42 years old when they joined.
