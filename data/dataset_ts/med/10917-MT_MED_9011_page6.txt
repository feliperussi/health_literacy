Clinical Study Results

What were the results of the study?
This is a summary of the main results from this study overall. The results each participant had might be different and are not in this summary.
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest. Other studies may provide new information or different results.
Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.

What signs and symptoms did the participants have during the study?
To answer this question, the study doctors did tests and measurements before and after the participants got MEDI9447. Then, the researchers compared the results.
The study doctors recorded:
- any changes in the participants' health
- any DLTs that happened

Overall, the researchers found that there were some changes in the participants' health. But, these changes were too small for the researchers to consider them to be meaningful. They also found that none of the participants had a DLT.

The study doctors also kept track of the "adverse events" that the participants had.
An adverse event is any sign or symptom that participants have during a study.
Doctors keep track of all the adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatment. An adverse event is considered "serious" when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care. Adverse events may or may not be caused by the treatment in the study. A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes an adverse event.

The adverse events that the participants had during this study are not in this summary. Because there was a very small number of participants, leaving this information out helps protect their identities.
