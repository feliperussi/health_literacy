Plain Protocol Title: Study of GSK3196165 for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic disease that causes joint pain and swelling. RA affects many people and can lead to disability. This study aims to test the safety and effectiveness of GSK3196165, a new medication, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for adults with moderate to severe RA who have not responded well to MTX. GSK3196165 has the potential to improve RA symptoms and provide a new treatment option.

Objectives: The goals of the study are to compare the effectiveness of GSK3196165 at doses of 90 mg and 150 mg per week to a placebo in treating moderate to severe RA. Secondary objectives include comparing the effectiveness of GSK3196165 to an active comparator, tofacitinib, and assessing the impact of GSK3196165 on patient-reported outcomes. The study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenic potential of GSK3196165.

Trial Design: The study will last for 52 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: GSK3196165 150 mg per week, GSK3196165 90 mg per week, tofacitinib capsules 5 mg twice a day, or a placebo. All participants will continue taking MTX during the study. After 12 weeks, participants in the placebo groups will switch to an active treatment. There will be an additional 8-week safety follow-up visit for participants who do not continue into a long-term extension study.

Trial Population: The study will include adults with moderate to severe RA who have not responded well to MTX. Participants must meet certain criteria, including having active disease, a specific level of tender and swollen joints, and elevated C-reactive protein. Other eligibility criteria include a minimum duration of RA, the presence of bone erosion on X-ray, and a stable dose of MTX for at least 8 weeks.

Interventions: Participants will receive either GSK3196165 injections or a placebo in combination with MTX. The injections will be given subcutaneously (under the skin). The treatment period will be 52 weeks, with an additional 8-week safety follow-up for some participants. Diagnostic and monitoring procedures may be performed as part of the study. The use of a placebo is justified to compare the effectiveness of GSK3196165 to no treatment.

Through this study, researchers aim to find a better treatment option for people with moderate to severe RA who have not responded well to MTX. The study will compare the effectiveness of GSK3196165 to a placebo and tofacitinib, as well as assess the impact on patient-reported outcomes. By understanding the safety and efficacy of GSK3196165, this study has the potential to improve the lives of individuals living with RA.
