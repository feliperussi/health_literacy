Plain Protocol Title: Study of a New Treatment for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body. This disease can cause symptoms such as rashes, joint pain, and organ damage. The study aims to understand the long-term safety and tolerability of a new medication called anifrolumab, which has the potential to treat the condition.

Objectives: The main goal of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of anifrolumab. Secondary objectives include evaluating the occurrence of adverse events and measuring the effectiveness of the treatment.

Trial Design: This is a Phase 3 study that will last approximately 3 years. Participants who have completed a previous Phase 3 study will continue to receive either anifrolumab or a placebo every 4 weeks for up to 39 doses. The medication will be given through an intravenous infusion that takes at least 30 minutes.

Trial Population: Adult participants who have completed a previous Phase 3 study for systemic lupus erythematosus will be eligible to participate. They may be taking other medications to manage their condition. There are no specific requirements for the severity of disease activity to be included in the study.

Interventions: Participants will receive either anifrolumab or a placebo every 4 weeks for up to 3 years. The medication will be given through an intravenous infusion that takes at least 30 minutes. Anifrolumab is a type of medication that targets the immune system to help control the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnostic and monitoring procedures will be conducted during the study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. A placebo is used as a comparison to evaluate the effects of anifrolumab.

This study aims to understand the long-term safety and tolerability of anifrolumab, a new treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. The study will involve adult participants who have completed a previous Phase 3 study for the condition. Participants will receive either anifrolumab or a placebo every 4 weeks for up to 3 years. The medication will be given through an intravenous infusion. The study will assess the occurrence of adverse events and measure the effectiveness of the treatment. The information collected from this study will contribute to the development of better treatment options for systemic lupus erythematosus. Approximately 575 subjects will be enrolled in the study.
