Plain Protocol Title: Evaluation of Otilimab IV for Severe COVID-19 Related Lung Disease

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat severe lung disease caused by COVID-19. This disease can cause breathing problems and requires oxygen support or mechanical ventilation. The study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of otilimab, a medication that targets the inflammation in the lungs caused by COVID-19.

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of otilimab to a placebo in treating severe COVID-19 related lung disease. The secondary goal is to assess the safety and tolerability of otilimab compared to the placebo.

Trial Design: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It will be conducted at multiple centers and will consist of two parts. Participants will receive either otilimab or a placebo in addition to standard care. The study will assess the participants' respiratory status and follow them for a specified period of time.

Trial Population: The study will include hospitalized participants with severe COVID-19 related lung disease who require significant oxygen support or mechanical ventilation. Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 79 and have a positive test for COVID-19. They must also show signs of inflammation and pneumonia. Some individuals may be excluded if they have certain medical conditions or are receiving certain treatments.

Interventions: Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous infusion of either otilimab or a placebo. The treatment will be administered over a one-hour period. All participants will continue to receive standard care as recommended by their healthcare providers.

In conclusion, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of otilimab in treating severe lung disease caused by COVID-19. Participants will receive either otilimab or a placebo, and their respiratory status will be closely monitored. The study will provide valuable information on the potential benefits of otilimab as a treatment for severe COVID-19 related lung disease.
