Plain Protocol Title: Study on Anifrolumab Treatment for Lupus

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body. It can cause various symptoms and can lead to serious health problems. Current treatments for SLE have limitations and side effects. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anifrolumab, a medication given through an intravenous treatment, compared to a placebo in adults with moderate to severe SLE.

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to see if anifrolumab is better than a placebo at reducing disease activity in people with SLE. The secondary objectives include evaluating the effects of anifrolumab on specific symptoms of SLE, such as joint pain and skin rash.

Trial Design: This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants will receive either anifrolumab or a placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for a total of 13 doses. The study will last for 52 weeks, and participants will be closely monitored during this time.

Trial Population: Adults aged 18 to 70 with moderate to severe SLE and who are already receiving standard of care treatment, such as corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, or immunosuppressants, can participate in the study. Certain criteria regarding disease activity and medication use must be met for eligibility.

Interventions: Participants will receive either a 300mg dose of anifrolumab or a placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The medication will be administered through an infusion pump over a minimum of 30 minutes. Participants will continue to receive their standard of care treatment along with the study medication. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anifrolumab compared to a placebo in reducing disease activity and improving symptoms of SLE.
