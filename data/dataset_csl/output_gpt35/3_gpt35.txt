Plain Protocol Title: A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab Combination Therapy or Durvalumab Monotherapy in Advanced Cancers

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid tumors. These tumors can cause a lot of harm to patients and current treatments may not be effective for everyone. The main goal of this study is to see if a combination of two medications, durvalumab and tremelimumab, or just durvalumab alone, can be a safer and more effective treatment for different types of solid tumors. This study is needed because the combination therapy or monotherapy has the potential to treat these cancers better than current treatment options.

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab or durvalumab alone in patients with advanced solid tumors. The specific objectives of the trial include measuring the incidence, severity, and outcome of adverse events (side effects) in patients receiving the study medications. Additionally, the study will evaluate the overall survival of patients and explore any additional secondary objectives specific to different tumor types.

Trial Design: This study is an open-label, multi-center trial. It will include a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up period of 90 days, and a survival follow-up period of up to 5 years. During the treatment period, patients will receive the study medications through intravenous infusion. The duration of the study will be approximately 2 to 3 years, with a total duration of 4 to 5 years.

Trial Population: Patients who will participate in this study are those with advanced solid tumors who meet specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will include patients of at least 18 years of age with a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients should not have received prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment, and they should not have certain medical conditions that may interfere with the study.

Interventions: The study will evaluate the combination therapy of durvalumab 1,500 mg and tremelimumab 75 mg, given through intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. After the combination therapy, patients will continue with durvalumab monotherapy, receiving 1,500 mg via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. Alternatively, patients may receive durvalumab monotherapy alone, receiving the same dose and frequency of infusion. The study will also include monitoring and diagnostic procedures to ensure patient safety.

In conclusion, this study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy or durvalumab monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. It will assess the incidence and severity of side effects, measure overall survival, and explore additional objectives specific to different tumor types. Patients who meet specific criteria will receive the study medications via intravenous infusion over a period of time. The study will span approximately 2 to 3 years with a total duration of 4 to 5 years.
