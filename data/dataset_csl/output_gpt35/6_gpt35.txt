Plain Protocol Title: New Treatment for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Rationale: Researchers are looking for a better way to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a type of cancer that can come back or spread to other parts of the body. The main goal of this study is to see if a new medication called GSK3359609 can improve the effectiveness of another medication called pembrolizumab and chemotherapy for HNSCC. The study medication has the potential to treat the cancer and improve patient outcomes.

Objectives: The main goal of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the combination of GSK3359609, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy to a placebo (inactive substance) in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The study will measure how well the treatments work in the total population of patients with HNSCC and in patients who have a certain level of a protein called PD-L1. Secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of the medications and assessing the impact of the treatment on symptoms and quality of life.

Trial Design: This study is designed to be a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II/III study. Participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC will be assigned randomly to receive either the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The study will last for approximately two years, with a maximum of 35 treatment cycles.

Trial Population: The study will include approximately 640 participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Participants must be at least 18 years old, have a diagnosis of HNSCC in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx, and have not received prior systemic therapy for their cancer. There are specific criteria that participants must meet to be eligible for the study, such as adequate organ function and a good overall health status.

Interventions: Participants will receive either GSK3359609 or a placebo, along with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. GSK3359609 is given as a 30-minute intravenous infusion, followed by pembrolizumab. The chemotherapy and pembrolizumab will be administered according to standard practices. The duration of treatment will be approximately two years, with six cycles of chemotherapy. Participants will be closely monitored for safety and any side effects related to the treatments.

In summary, this study aims to find a better treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study will compare the effectiveness and safety of adding GSK3359609 to pembrolizumab and chemotherapy versus using a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. Participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC will be randomly assigned to one of the treatments. The study will measure how well the treatments work in different populations of patients and evaluate their impact on symptoms and quality of life. This study has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with HNSCC.
