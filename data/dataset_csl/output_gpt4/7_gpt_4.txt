Plain Protocol Title: Testing the Impact of the Medicine Benralizumab on Asthma Symptoms in an Easy-to-Understand Study 

Rationale: Asthma is a common condition that can cause problems breathing. Some of these problems are due to the body responding too strongly to things like air particles, causing inflammation and discomfort. In this study, scientists want to find a better way to treat asthma. They are studying a medicine called benralizumab that might help reduce this overreaction in non-smokers who have a mild form of asthma caused by allergies. They believe the medicine might help by reducing inflammation, making it easier for people with asthma to breathe. This study will test this idea to see if benralizumab is effective for patients with asthma.

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to see if benralizumab can affect the body's response to allergens (things that cause allergies). Specifically, researchers want to see if the medicine reduces the number of specific cells, called eosinophils, in patients' spit after being exposed to allergens. These cells increase in number when the body reacts to allergens, which can make asthma symptoms worse. Additionally, the study hopes to find out if the medicine can lessen patients� asthma response a few hours after exposure to allergens. Other goals include testing whether the medication reduces the number of these cells in lung tissue and blood. 

Trial Design: Participants in this study will be split into two groups. One group will get the medicine benralizumab, while the other will get a placebo, or fake medicine that doesn't have any effects. None of the participants will know which one they get. The drug will be given under the skin every 4 weeks, three times in total. Later, the patients' reactions to allergens will be tested. The whole study will take several months to complete.

Trial Population: This research study will involve nearly 40 people, both men and women. To participate, you should be between 18 and 65 years old, with asthma symptoms triggered by allergies. You have to be a non-smoker, and not taking any long-term medicines for asthma. You should also be generally healthy and able to give a spit sample when asked.

Interventions: During the study, you will be given an injection of benralizumab or a placebo (meaning it contains no real medicine) under your skin every four weeks, for a total of three doses. You won�t know whether you�re getting the real drug or placebo. Then, the doctors will expose you to an allergen, and check your response. They will do this by counting eosinophils in your spit and blood and checking your lung function. They will repeat this process to obtain two sets of data.
