Plain Protocol Title: A Study to Test the Safety and Effectiveness of Otilimab in Patients with Severe Lung Disease Due to COVID-19

Rationale: Researchers are trying to find a better way to treat severe lung disease caused by COVID-19. This disease can greatly reduce a patient's ability to breathe and can also be severe enough to require hospitalization or use of a breathing machine. Otilimab is a medicine that has shown positive results in calming down overactive immune responses. This is important because when COVID-19 gets severe, it's often because the body's immune system is overacting and damaging its own cells instead of just fighting off the virus. Thus, there is a reason to believe that Otilimab can help treat this severe lung disease by calming down this overactive immune response.

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to see if Otilimab can improve breathing in patients with severe COVID-19 lung disease compared to a placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect used as a control in testing new drugs). We will determine this by measuring the change in patients' need for oxygen support or use of a breathing machine. As secondary goals, we also want to check if Otilimab can provide other benefits to patients and whether it is safe to use.

Trial Design: This study is planned to be performed in different hospitals. Participants will be randomly chosen to get either Otilimab or placebo, along with the usual care for severe COVID-19 lung disease. We don't know who will get which (that's the "double-blind" part). We'll monitor the health status of each participant daily until they leave the hospital (or up to 28 days) and have follow-ups 42 and 60 days after the treatment starts. 

Trial Population: This study is for adults aged between 18-79 years who have a positive test for COVID-19 and are in the hospital because of severe lung disease caused by the virus. To be eligible, participants also need to have recently started needing significant oxygen support, such as high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation. Participants cannot join if they have certain pre-existing conditions or are taking immunosuppressant medicines or treatments for diseases other than COVID-19.

Interventions: Participants will receive a one-time infusion (direct injection into the blood) of either Otilimab or a placebo. This will be in addition to the standard care they are already receiving for their condition. We're using a placebo so we can be sure that any changes we see are due to Otilimab and not just the standard care or random chance.
