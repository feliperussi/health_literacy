Plain Protocol Title: A Study on Safely Testing a New TB Medicine (GSK3036656) in Patients with Regular �Drug-Sensitive� TB.

Rationale: Researchers are working to find improved treatments for tuberculosis (TB). TB is a severe disease, causing even more deaths than AIDS. Right now, we have a potential TB treatment, a drug called GSK3036656, which stops the bacteria from growing. This research will look at how well GSK3036656 works against the bacteria responsible for TB, specifically in patients with a common kind of TB that can still be treated with usual drugs. This drug is important because TB is still widespread and the existing treatments don't work well enough, and can lead to the bacteria growing resistant to them. We also need to be able to treat the more stubborn, drug-resistant strains of TB. 

Objectives: The main goal of the study is to see how much GSK3036656 can reduce the TB bacteria count in patients over two weeks. We'll look at how the bacteria amounts change from the start of the treatment to day 14. We also want to understand how the drug behaves in the body and how safe it is. One more thing we're checking is how quickly GSK3036656 starts to work - from the very beginning to day 2, and then from day 2 to day 14.

Trial Design: The study involves testing groups of patients one after the other. Within each group, three out of every four patients will receive GSK3036656, while others will get the regular TB treatment. This study is �open-label�, which means both the patients and the doctors will know which treatment they're getting. The doctors analyzing the lab tests won't know, to make sure their results are unbiased. All in all, we expect each patient's involvement in the study to last for about 5 weeks.

Trial Population: We'll include up to 100 participants, divided into five groups. Our participants are adults, aged 18-65, diagnosed with a fresh case of TB but they haven't yet started treatment. Their TB must be detectable in their sputum (coughed-up material). We have a list of health standards they must meet, for example their heart and kidney must function well. They should not be suffering from other severe TB forms, allergic reactions, skin condition called vitiligo, alcohol or drug abuse, or certain illnesses associated with HIV infection. They also shouldn't be on other clinical trials or taking certain medicines.

Interventions: The study investigates the impact of GSK3036656. It comes in a capsule form and we'll look at doses of 1 mg, 5 mg, or 25 mg. It's taken orally, or by mouth. We'll compare it to the standard TB treatment of a combination of four different drugs, given in a form of a pill. The treatment will last two weeks, but all participants will switch to the regular TB treatment after the study.
