Plain Protocol Title: Testing the Effectiveness and Safety of Anifrolumab in Adults with Active Lupus

Rationale: Lupus is a chronic illness that affects the immune system and can cause different health problems throughout the body. The disease can cause fatigue, rashes, joint pain, and kidney problems, among other things. This can lead to physical discomfort and even job loss, reducing the quality of life for patients. Right now, there's a need for better ways to treat Lupus. This study aims to see if a new medication, called Anifrolumab, can safely and effectively treat adults with active Lupus. 

Objectives: The main goal of this study is to see if Anifrolumab can improve Lupus symptoms better than a placebo, after one year of treatment. Improvement will be measured using a special assessment tool called the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA). This tool checks a variety of signs and symptoms of Lupus, looking for improvements. Other objectives include seeing whether the medication can reduce skin rash severity and joint pain, lower the dose of other Lupus medicines needed, and if it can be safely tolerated.

Trial Design: This study is conducted across different locations and will include around 360 adults with Lupus, aged between 18 and 70. Half of the participants will receive Anifrolumab and the other half will receive a placebo (a treatment with no active medication), both given through an IV (a drip into the vein). This is completely random and neither the patient nor the doctors will know which treatment they’re getting, to make the results more reliable. The treatment will be given once every 4 weeks for 48 weeks (around 1 year), and the effects of the treatment will be measured at the end of this one-year period.

Trial Population: This study will involve adults between the ages of 18 and 70, who have moderate to severe Lupus which is marked by the presence of certain antibodies. Participants must already be on treatment for Lupus, including oral corticosteroids, antimalarials, and/or immunosuppressants. 

Interventions: The treatment being tested is called Anifrolumab. It will be given through an IV (a drip into the vein) every 4 weeks over a course of one year. This medication will be compared to a placebo. A placebo looks just like the Anifrolumab treatment but it doesn't have any medication in it. The use of a placebo helps researchers see if the effects of Anifrolumab are due to the treatment itself or are psychological. All participants will also continue their usual Lupus treatments alongside the study medication or placebo. In this study, we will measure changes in Lupus symptoms and check for any side effects.
