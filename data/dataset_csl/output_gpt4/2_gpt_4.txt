Plain Protocol Title: Testing the Long-Term Safety of Anifrolumab for Adults with Active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Rationale: Researchers are trying to find better ways to treat Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a long-term illness where the body's immune system starts attacking its own cells, leading to various symptoms like rashes, joint pain, kidney problems, and brain function issues. It mostly affects women of child-bearing age. Current treatments for SLE often have significant side effects, and there’s an immediate need for safer and more effective options. This study will test a medication called Anifrolumab, which may slow down the immune system response and reduce the requirement for existing treatments.

Objectives: The main goal is to see if Anifrolumab is safe and can be tolerated in the long term by adults suffering from SLE. We will measure this by counting any change in the numbers of side effects or negative reactions during the study.

Trial Design: This is a study where participants are selected at random to receive either Anifrolumab or a placebo (medicine having no effect) through an IV (a tube that goes into your vein). Participants will not know which one they are receiving. The treatment will last for about 3 years. Every 4 weeks, a dose of the treatment or placebo will be given. We plan to include approximately 575 people in the study who have already participated in a prior study with Anifrolumab.

Trial Population: Adults who have already completed a previous study on Anifrolumab and have moderate to severe active SLE are eligible to participate. Participants can be taking medicines like oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, or antimalarials and do not need to have a specific level of disease activity to join this follow-up study. People already participating in another clinical trial or women who intend to become pregnant during the study cannot participate.

Interventions: You will receive Anifrolumab (300 mg) or a placebo through an IV every 4 weeks. The treatment will run for up to 39 rounds (0 week to 152nd week). The medicine or placebo dose will be given through an infusion pump over 30 minutes. Anifrolumab has been developed to potentially slow down your immune response which is overactive in SLE. If a placebo is used, it's to compare the effects with the actual drug and assess the drug's effectiveness correctly.
